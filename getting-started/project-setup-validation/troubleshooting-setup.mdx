# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve common problems encountered during the setup of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you face installation errors, compilation or linking failures, or runtime issues when running your first test, these troubleshooting steps and diagnostic commands will enable you to recover smoothly and continue your testing journey.

---

## 1. Common Setup Problems and Their Solutions

### Problem: GoogleTest or GoogleMock Cannot Be Found by the Build System

**Symptoms:**

- Compilation fails with errors indicating missing header files like `gtest/gtest.h` or `gmock/gmock.h`.
- Linker errors related to missing GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries.

**Solution:**

1. Verify that GoogleTest/GoogleMock source or installed headers are correctly located.
2. If using CMake, confirm your `CMakeLists.txt` includes GoogleTest via `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` or uses `add_subdirectory()` pointing to the GoogleTest source.
3. Confirm that the include paths and linker settings are correctly set. For example:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_test_target GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)
```

4. When embedding GoogleTest as a git submodule or downloading manually, ensure the paths match your project structure.
5. If building standalone, perform the recommended CMake build steps outlined in the Installation Options guide.

<Tip>
Use verbose build output (`make VERBOSE=1` or corresponding flags) to trace where your compiler is searching for headers and libraries.
</Tip>

### Problem: Linker Errors on Windows Related to the Runtime Library

**Symptoms:**

- Errors mentioning "mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'", e.g., `MTd_StaticDebug` vs `MDd_DynamicDebug`.

**Solution:**

1. GoogleTest defaults to static linking of the runtime on Windows.
2. Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to force linking runtime libraries dynamically to match your project settings.

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

3. Rebuild GoogleTest after changing this flag.

<Note>
Check your Visual Studio project settings to keep runtime library linkage consistent across all dependencies.
</Note>

### Problem: Compilation Errors Due to Unsupported C++ Standard

**Symptoms:**

- Errors mentioning missing headers or language features.

**Solution:**

1. GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler.
2. Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or later.
3. In your CMake build, enforce C++17 compliance:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

4. If using other build systems, add the appropriate flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).

---

### Problem: GoogleTest Macros Conflict with Other Libraries

**Symptoms:**

- Macro redefinition errors involving GoogleTest macros (`ASSERT_*`, `TEST`, etc.).

**Solution:**

1. Use GoogleTest's feature to rename macros via compiler flags.
2. Add compiler definitions like:

```
-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
```

3. In code, prefix macros with `GTEST_` (e.g., `GTEST_TEST` instead of `TEST`).

---

## 2. Diagnostic Commands and Validation Steps

### Validate GoogleTest Installation

Run the following commands within the GoogleTest build directory:

```bash
cmake ..
make
ctest --verbose
```

Expected output should show tests running and passing.

### Checking Thread Safety

GoogleTest depends on pthread library support for thread safety.

You can check if GoogleTest detected pthread with:

```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#if GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE
#pragma message("GoogleTest is thread-safe.")
#else
#pragma message("GoogleTest is NOT thread-safe.")
#endif
```

---

### Debugging Runtime Issues When Running Tests

If tests do not run or crash on launch:

- Ensure `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- Confirm that your `main()` returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- If using `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries, confirm these are linked properly to provide an entry point.

- Check for errors or output when running tests manually:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_list_tests
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=*
```

---

## 3. Troubleshooting Build Integration Issues

### CMake Integration

- Confirm correct usage of `FetchContent_Declare` or subdirectory addition if embedding GoogleTest.
- Use debug-level CMake logs to trace inclusion paths.
- Synchronize compiler and linker flags across your main project and GoogleTest.

### Bazel and Other Build Systems

- Follow appropriate integration documentation to include GoogleTest dependencies and linkage.
- Check for conflicting optimization or runtime flags.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Smooth Setup

- Use version v1.17.0 or later of GoogleTest for up-to-date stability and compatibility.
- When using GoogleMock, link `gmock_main` for the provided main function and simplify your setup.
- Avoid calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` more than once to prevent unexpected behavior.
- Always check the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and propagate it from your `main()`.

<Check>
If you modify or extend the framework, keep GoogleTest assertions and test registration patterns consistent.
