# System Requirements

This page outlines the minimum C++ standard, supported compiler versions, operating systems, and necessary tools required to run GoogleTest. It also summarizes compatibility considerations based on Google's foundational C++ policy to help you assess your environment's readiness before installation and usage.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires your development environment to support **C++17** or later. This standard provides modern language features that GoogleTest depends on for stability, performance, and compatibility.

### How to Ensure C++17 Support

- When using CMake, set your project to require C++17 explicitly:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- Alternatively, if your build system uses custom compiler flags, add the appropriate flag:

  - GCC and Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - MSVC: `/std:c++17`


> <Note>
> If you try building with a C++ standard prior to C++17, compilation will fail with an error from GoogleTest's internal checks.
> </Note>

---

## 2. Supported Compilers and Versions

GoogleTest supports a variety of major C++ compilers that comply with the requirements of C++17. While support may vary depending on platform and version, below are common compilers verified to work well:

| Compiler           | Minimum Recommended Version      | Additional Notes                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GCC                | 7.0.0 or higher                  | Ensure `-pthread` flag is included   |
| Clang              | 3.4.1 or higher                  | Compatible with libc++ or libstdc++  |
| MSVC (Visual Studio) | Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (19.11) or later | Supports required features and `/std:c++17` flag |
| Intel LLVM         | Recent versions supporting C++17 | Use carefully, check flags as needed |
| SunPro             | Versions supporting `-features=except` | Explicit flags needed for exceptions and RTTI |

> <Tip>
> For MSVC, the minimum version corresponds to Visual Studio 2017 Update 3, which introduced better C++17 compliance and support for necessary compiler attributes.
> </Tip>

## 3. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to run on a wide range of platforms consistent with Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy. Below are the most stable and officially supported OSes:

### Primary Supported Platforms

- **Linux:** Various distributions with kernel support
- **Windows:** Desktop editions including Windows 7 and newer; support also for MinGW environments
- **Mac OS X:** Desktop versions and derivatives

### Additional Platforms with Support or Partial Support

GoogleTest includes platform-detection macros and conditional support for various other platforms, including:

- Cygwin
- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- Solaris
- Android (limited, via Linux support)
- Fuchsia
- Haiku
- Various embedded platforms like ESP32 and ESP8266 (with reduced functionality)

> <Note>
> GoogleTest requires a file system and basic POSIX features for full functionality, so platforms without this support may have limited features.
> </Note>

## 4. Required Tools and Libraries

- **Build Systems Supported:**
  - CMake (recommended for cross-platform builds)
  - Bazel (alternative option)
- **Threading Library:**
  - POSIX pthreads library (on platforms supporting multithreading)
  - Windows threading primitives where pthreads is unavailable
- **Regular Expression Library:**
  - By default, GoogleTest uses Abseil's RE2 regex engine if built with Abseil
  - Otherwise, POSIX regex or a simple internal regex implementation

> <Tip>
> If pthread detection fails or is incorrect, you can force enable or disable pthread support with compiler flags `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`.
> </Tip>

---

## 5. Compatibility Considerations

GoogleTest automatically detects environment capabilities but allows manual override via preprocessor macros.

### Key Macros For Environment Tweaking

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`: Enables pthread support (1) or disables it (0).
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`: Whether C++ exceptions are enabled.
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`: Whether Runtime Type Information (RTTI) is enabled.
- `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`: Controls availability of `std::wstring` support.
- `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`: Controls filesystem availability (generally required for death tests and output capture).

### Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy

GoogleTest aligns with the officially supported compilers and platforms in [Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), which lists:

- Supported compiler versions
- Supported operating systems
- Supported standard libraries

You can consult this resource to verify environment readiness and to ensure your project uses supported configurations for long-term compatibility.

---

## 6. Multi-threading and Thread Safety

GoogleTest is thread-safe where pthreads or equivalent threading libraries are available.

- On supported platforms, GoogleTest uses efficient mutexes and thread-local storage.
- Detect thread safety at compile time using the macro: `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.

> <Note>
> If your platform does not support pthreads or threading, GoogleTest will compile with dummy synchronization implementations, which means multithreaded test code may risk race conditions.
> </Note>

---

## 7. Best Practices Before Installation

1. **Verify your compiler supports C++17** by checking the version and flags.
2. **Confirm threading library availability and file system presence** for full GoogleTest functionality.
3. **Use CMake to generate builds** as it handles platform-specific settings and flags automatically.
4. **If building on Windows, consider the `gtest_force_shared_crt` flag** in CMake to control runtime linking behavior.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Environment Compatibility

### Common Issues

- **Compilation errors about C++17 features:** Verify your compiler version and standard flags.
- **Linker errors related to pthreads:** Ensure compiler and linker flags include pthread (e.g., `-pthread` on Linux).
- **Runtime failures on unsupported platforms or missing filesystem:** Confirm your environment meets minimum platform requirements.
- **MSVC runtime mismatch errors:** Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake.

### Helpful Commands

- Check compiler version:
  ```bash
  g++ --version
  clang++ --version
  cl.exe
  ```

- Confirm C++ standard flag is set in your build configuration.

- Inspect your build logs for preprocessor macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` and `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.

## Summary

Before installing and running GoogleTest, ensure your development environment supports C++17 and uses a compatible compiler and platform as detailed above. Proper configuration of your build system, threading libraries, and runtime flags will guarantee smooth building, linking, and execution of your tests.

If your environment varies from these requirements, consult GoogleTest compatibility macros and environment overrides to tweak behavior or seek support.
