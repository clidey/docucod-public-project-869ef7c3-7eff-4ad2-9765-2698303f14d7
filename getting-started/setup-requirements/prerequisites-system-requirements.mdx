# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the following requirements before installing and building **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock**. This foundational preparation guarantees a smooth setup and the ability to build the tools successfully.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest is designed as a cross-platform C++ test framework supporting a wide range of platforms and compilers. It follows Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy.

- **Supported Operating Systems:**
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows (Desktop, MinGW)
  - Other Unix-like systems (e.g., FreeBSD, Solaris)

- **Supported Compilers:**
  - GCC (with C++17 support)
  - Clang (with C++17 support)
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 and later

For detailed platform, compiler, and build tool versions supported, visit the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) table.


## 2. C++ Language Standard

GoogleTest requires an environment supporting the **C++17 standard**.

- You must ensure your compiler is configured to use **C++17 or later**.
- In CMake projects, specify this by adding:
  
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- Alternatively, provide compiler flags directly (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang).

> Attempting to build GoogleTest with earlier C++ standards will lead to compile-time errors.


## 3. Build System Requirements

GoogleTest offers a robust CMake build script that is highly recommended for building and integration.

- **CMake version:** 3.14 or later required, due to use of modern CMake features like `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`.
- Compatible native build tools:
  - `make` (common Unix/Linux)
  - Visual Studio MSBuild (`gtest.sln` generated on Windows)
  - Xcode (`.xcodeproj` generated on macOS)
  - Ninja or others supported by CMake generators

If you donâ€™t have CMake installed, download it for free from [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/).


## 4. Dependencies and Environment Setup

- **Header and source files:** Your build system needs to locate `googletest/include` and the source files in the GoogleTest repository.
- **Threading support:**
  - GoogleTest is thread-safe where pthreads are available.
  - On *nix systems, ensure pthread libraries are available and linked if you manage your own build rules.
- **Visual Studio Runtime Considerations:**
  When building on Windows with Visual Studio, linking conflicts over CRT (C Runtime) can occur due to the static linking default in GoogleTest.

  Use the CMake option:
  
  ```bash
  -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```
  
  to align GoogleTest runtime linkage to dynamic, matching your project settings.


## 5. Optional Build Flags and Macros

GoogleTest allows tweaking behavior through compiler macros at build time.

- **Multi-threading:**
  - To force pthread usage or disable it, define:
    
    ```bash
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # to force pthread
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # to disable pthread
    ```

- **Shared Library Build:**

  Build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL) by adding compiler flags:

  ```bash
  -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1  # when building tests that use shared gtest
  ```

- **Avoiding Macro Name Clashes:**

  If GoogleTest macros conflict with macros from other libraries, you can rename them with:

  ```bash
  -DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1  # For example, changes TEST macro to GTEST_TEST
  ```

Refer to [gtest-port.h](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) for a complete list of customizable macros.


## 6. Filesystem and Platform Features

- GoogleTest expects a filesystem to function properly.
- Most platforms support this, but GoogleTest disables filesystem-based features on restricted platforms like some embedded systems.
- Stream redirection support (needed for capturing output during tests) is generally available except on some mobile or embedded systems.


## 7. System Permissions and Installation

- Installing GoogleTest system-wide (e.g., running `sudo make install` on Linux) requires administrator rights.
- For local or CI environments, building with GoogleTest as a subdirectory or using CMake's `FetchContent` is recommended to avoid global installation permissions.


## Best Practices & Tips

- Always check your compiler and toolchain versions to confirm C++17 support before building.
- Use CMake as the primary build method for simplicity and portability.
- If you encounter runtime errors related to threading or linking, verify the settings for `gtest_force_shared_crt` and pthread linkage.
- When integrating GoogleTest into your existing CMake project, adding it as a subdirectory or importing via `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` is preferable to manual copying.


## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

| Issue                                   | Cause and Fix                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compilation fails due to C++ standard   | Ensure compiler flags include C++17 (`-std=c++17` or equivalent).
| Missing pthread symbols on *nix         | Add `-pthread` to both compiler and linker flags if not using CMake's built-in support.
| Link-time errors with Visual Studio CRT | Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` when configuring with CMake.
| File system not accessible or missing   | Confirm working directory and environment variables; GoogleTest assumes a POSIX-like file system.
