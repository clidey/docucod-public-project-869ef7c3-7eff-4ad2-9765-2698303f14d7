# Preparing Your Development Environment

Setting up your development environment correctly is the crucial first step to harnessing the power of GoogleTest effectively. This guide walks you through the essential preliminary actions, from selecting a suitable build system to validating compiler capabilities, ensuring a smooth integration for your C++ test suite.

---

## 1. Choose Your Build System

GoogleTest supports integration with popular build systems commonly used in C++ development. Choosing the right build system helps simplify dependency management and compiling test code.

### Supported Build Systems
- **CMake**: The most flexible and widely used option, enabling standalone builds or easy integration into existing projects.
- **Bazel**: A Google-originated build system offering high performance for large projects.
- **Custom or other build tools**: You can incorporate GoogleTest by manually setting include paths and linking libraries.

### Recommended Setup
For most users, CMake is the recommended way because:

- It provides platform-independent build scripts.
- It automatically detects environment and compiler properties.
- It manages building both GoogleTest and your tests seamlessly.

### Links
- See [Installing with CMake](../installation-initialization/install-cmake) for detailed instructions.
- See [Installing with Bazel](../installation-initialization/install-bazel) if you prefer Bazel.

## 2. Install Required Dependencies

Before building GoogleTest, ensure your system has the following prerequisites:

### Compiler and Language Support
- **C++17 Standard Support:** GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports at least C++17.
- **Supported Compilers:**
  - GCC 7.3 or later
  - Clang 6.0 or later
  - MSVC 2017 Update 15.7 or later

Validate your compiler version before proceeding.

### Build Tools
- **CMake:** Version 3.14 or newer to use modern target and dependency commands.
- **Make/Build System Tools:** Depending on your platform
- **Git:** To clone the source repository if building from source

### Environment Checks
- Ensure threading is supported (GoogleTest is thread-safe where pthreads are available).
- Confirm availability of filesystem support.

<Tip>
Use your compiler’s version check commands to verify system readiness:
```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version

# Clang example
clang --version

# MSVC example
cl
```
</Tip>

## 3. Validate Compiler and Platform Support

Before integrating GoogleTest in your project, confirm that your compiler and OS platform meet the minimal requirements to avoid build-time pitfalls.

### How to Validate

- Attempt compiling a simple C++17 program or run a minimal GoogleTest sample.
- Confirm that necessary language features such as variadic templates, constexpr, and structured bindings are supported.

````cpp
// Minimal C++17 test
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  if constexpr(sizeof(int) >= 4) {
    std::cout << "C++17 supported." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "Incompatible compiler." << std::endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
````

### Avoid Common Pitfalls
- Using outdated compilers that lack C++17 support.
- Building on unsupported older platforms.

<Warning>
If your compiler does not support C++17, you will need to upgrade or choose an alternative environment. GoogleTest depends on C++17 features and will fail to build otherwise.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Environment Setup Recommendations

### Source Control
- Clone the official [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) on the `main` (latest) branch to ensure up-to-date features and bug fixes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
```

### Directory Structure
- Keep the GoogleTest source isolated or embedded logically within your project.
- Create a dedicated build directory (e.g., `googletest/build`) to hold your build files.

### Compiler Flags
- Explicitly specify C++17 standard where required (e.g., with flags `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or `/std:c++17` for MSVC).

---

## 5. Validate Your Setup with a Minimal Build

Perform a quick build of GoogleTest to verify your environment is correctly set:

### With CMake
```bash
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Expected Outcome
- Build completes without errors.
- Libraries such as `libgtest.a` and optionally `libgmock.a` are generated.

<Tip>
If you only want GoogleTest without GoogleMock, run: `cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`
</Tip>

### Troubleshooting
- If build fails due to missing C++17 support, verify your compiler and its flags.
- On Windows, check runtime library consistency (`gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake).

---

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to [Installing with CMake](../installation-initialization/install-cmake) for detailed build and integration instructions.
- Explore [Running the Sample Tests](../../first-test-experience/run-sample-tests) to confirm your tests execute successfully.

Upgrade to at least CMake 3.14. Modern versions of CMake facilitate easier GoogleTest builds with correct dependency and target management.

### Example Minimal `main()` Using GoogleTest

Once your environment is ready, a simple `main()` function to begin testing looks like:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This initializes GoogleTest with command-line arguments and runs all registered tests.

## Summary
By carefully preparing your development environment following this guide, you ensure a robust foundation for writing and running C++ tests using GoogleTest. The upcoming steps involve detailed installation procedures and authoring your first tests.
