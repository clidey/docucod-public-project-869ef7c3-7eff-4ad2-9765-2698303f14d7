# Supported Platforms and Environments

GoogleTest is designed to be versatile and portable across a wide range of platforms and development environments used by C++ developers. Ensuring compatibility with your target platform is crucial for a smooth build and test experience.

---

## Officially Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), enabling consistent compatibility with approved compiler versions and operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions and kernel versions)
- **Windows** (Desktop editions, including MSVC and MinGW builds)
- **Mac OS X and iOS**
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD**
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **Fuchsia** (experimental)

For a detailed and up-to-date list of supported compilers, platforms, and build tools, refer to the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

<Note>
Some platforms, such as Fuchsia, are not officially supported and may encounter limitations or require specific configuration.
</Note>

## Compiler Requirements

- GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports **C++17** or newer standards.
- Commonly supported compilers include:
  - GCC 7.0 and above
  - Clang 5.0 and above
  - MS Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 and later
  - Intel C++ compiler supporting C++17

<Check>
An environment with a compliant C++17 compiler is mandatory to compile GoogleTest successfully.
</Check>

## Threading and Concurrency Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where **pthreads** are available.
- On Windows, native thread APIs are used to provide thread safety.
- Some embedded or mobile platforms might lack full threading support.

<Warning>
If your platform does not support pthreads or an equivalent threading model, GoogleTest's thread safety features may be limited. This can affect test parallelism and certain advanced functionalities like death tests.
</Warning>

## Environment and Runtime Notes

- GoogleTest detects platform and environment specifics automatically using predefined macros during compilation.
- To customize behavior for unusual environments or to override defaults, users can define platform or feature macros explicitly in build configurations.
- Certain GoogleTest features (e.g., death tests, stream redirection) require a full file system or specific OS capabilities. These are automatically disabled or adjusted on platforms where unavailable.

<AccordionGroup title="Environment-Specific Caveats">
<Accordion title="Windows Variants">
Microsoft Windows supports multiple variants:

- Desktop editions (fully supported)
- Windows Mobile and Windows Phone (limited support)

GoogleTest disables some features on Windows Mobile due to system restrictions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Embedded Platforms">
Support for platforms like ESP8266, ESP32, and Xtensa is limited and may lack full POSIX or standard C library support, affecting GoogleTest's capabilities.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How GoogleTest Detects Platforms

GoogleTest leverages internal macros in its codebase to identify the compilation environment accurately. This enables it to:

- Tailor implementations for OS-specific APIs
- Enable or disable platform-dependent features
- Optimize test execution and resource use

For example, macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC` signal the detected operating system.

<CodeGroup>
```cpp
#ifdef __CYGWIN__
#define GTEST_OS_CYGWIN 1
#elif defined(__MINGW__) || defined(__MINGW32__) || defined(__MINGW64__)
#define GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW 1
#define GTEST_OS_WINDOWS 1
#elif defined _WIN32
#define GTEST_OS_WINDOWS 1
// ... other platform-specific defines ...
#endif
```
</CodeGroup>

## Validating Platform Compatibility

To ensure your development environment is compatible:

1. Check the operating system and version against the supported list.
2. Verify that your compiler meets the minimum version and C++ standard requirements.
3. Confirm availability of essential libraries (e.g., pthreads on Unix-like systems).
4. Refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation and community discussions.

<Tip>
Use the `GTEST_OS_*` macros inside your code or custom test setups to enable platform-specific customizations if necessary.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Platform Issues

### Common Issues

- **Unsupported Compiler Version:** Upgrade or switch to a compatible compiler with C++17 support.
- **Missing Threading Support:** Ensure pthreads or Windows threading APIs are available and correctly linked.
- **Build Failures on Embedded or Exotic Platforms:** Confirm platform macros are correctly defined or explicitly set needed macros.

### Steps to Resolve

- Check compiler and system documentation for threading and library support.
- Consider building with minimal features (`-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`) if threading is problematic.
- Engage with the community via the official GoogleTest repository for niche platform support assistance.

## Summary

This document helps you quickly verify if GoogleTest is compatible with your platform and environment, pointing out the supported operating systems, compilers, threading capabilities, and environment-specific considerations.
