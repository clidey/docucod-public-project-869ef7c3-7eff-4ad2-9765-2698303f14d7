# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Prepare your development environment for GoogleTest and GoogleMock by verifying that your system, compiler, and build tools meet the necessary requirements. This ensures a smooth installation and reliable operation.

---

## 1. Programming Language Requirements

- **C++ Standard**: GoogleTest and GoogleMock require **C++17** or newer. Your compiler must support the full C++17 standard.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to function on the following platforms:

- **Linux** (multiple distributions)
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (including versions compatible with Visual Studio and MinGW)

Ensure your operating system is updated to a stable release version supported by your toolchain.

---

## 3. Compiler Support

You need a C++17-compliant compiler. Recommended compilers include:

- **GCC 7** or newer
- **Clang 6** or newer
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017)** or newer

Check your compiler's version by running:

```bash
# GCC
gcc --version

# Clang
clang --version

# MSVC (Developer Command Prompt)
cl
```

If your compiler does not meet these requirements, upgrade it before proceeding.

---

## 4. Build Tools & Environments

To build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock, ensure the following tools are available and configured:

- **CMake** (recommended for cross-platform building)
  - Minimum version depends on your platform; CMake 3.10+ generally suffices.
  - Verify with `cmake --version`

- **Make** (Linux/macOS)
  - Typically pre-installed.

- **Ninja** (optional, for faster builds)

- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (Windows)
  - For Visual Studio users, ensure the correct C++ workload is installed.

- **Bazel** (optional)
  - GoogleTest supports building with Bazel; if used, ensure Bazel is installed.

---

## 5. Development Environment Setup

- Ensure your environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `INCLUDE`, `LIB`) are correctly set for your compiler and build tools.
  - For Windows, use the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio to set these automatically.

- For integration with IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion), configure your project to use C++17 and include GoogleTest headers accordingly.

---

## 6. Network and Access Requirements

- Internet access may be necessary to clone the GoogleTest repository or download source code during installation.

- Firewall and proxy settings should allow Git and CMake/network requests if fetching dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Is Too Old or Not Found">
Check that your compiler supports C++17. If not, update it. Use `gcc --version` or `clang --version` to verify.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Tools Missing or Not Configured">
Install missing build tools like CMake or make. On Windows, use the Visual Studio Installer to add C++ build workloads.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment Variables Not Set">
Ensure your PATH includes directories for compiler binaries and build tools. On Windows, use the Developer Command Prompt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Restrictions">
If cloning the repository fails, check your firewall and proxy settings.

## Next Steps

After confirming your prerequisites and environment setup, proceed to the installation instructions in the [Installation Overview](/getting-started/setup-requirements/installation-overview) guide to build and integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your projects.

<Tip>
Always verify your toolchain versions before installation to avoid obscure build errors.
</Tip>

<Check>
Ensure your compiler supports C++17 by checking its version.
</Check>

<Note>
Using the Developer Command Prompt on Windows simplifies environment setup.
</Note>

## Example Checks

```bash
# Check C++ compiler version
gcc --version
clang --version
cl  # In VS Developer Command Prompt

# Check CMake version
cmake --version

# Check make or ninja availability
make --version
ninja --version
```

---

By fulfilling these prerequisites, your environment will be ready to install and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock for robust C++ testing.
