# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets these requirements before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Preparing ahead guarantees smooth building, integration, and testing.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Version

- **C++17 or newer** is required to build and use GoogleTest.
- Ensure your compiler supports the C++17 standard, which provides necessary language features for the framework.

> To enforce C++17 in your CMake project:
>
> ```cmake
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
> ```

> Alternatively, you can provide compiler flags such as:
>
> ```bash
> -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17"
> ```

<Check>
Use `std::filesystem` or `std::string_view` features in your project with C++17 enabled to verify compliance.
</Check>

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports building and running tests on the following OSes:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW)
- **macOS**

GoogleTest also supports many UNIX-like platforms including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and others, but the focus and primary support are on the three listed above.

<Info>
Building and running on embedded platforms or specialized OSes may require additional tweaks or may have limited support.
</Info>

---

## 3. Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler with full C++17 support. Minimum supported compiler versions include:

| Compiler                | Minimum Version        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **GCC**                 | 7.0 or higher          |
| **Clang**               | 5.0 or higher          |
| **Microsoft Visual C++**| 2017 Update 3 (version 15.7) or higher |
| **Intel Compiler**      | Corresponding recent versions supporting C++17 |

<Warning>
Older versions or compilers with incomplete C++17 support are *not* supported and may cause build failures or undefined behavior.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Multi-Threading and Thread Safety

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where **pthread** library support is available.
- On Windows, native threading primitives are used.
- If pthread is detected and enabled, certain thread-related features become available.

<Note>
If you encounter problems related to pthread detection, use the compiler flag:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable explicitly
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable explicitly
```

In CMake, this can be added via `add_compile_definitions()` or `target_compile_definitions()`.
</Note>

---

## 5. Third-Party Dependencies

- GoogleTest has **no mandatory external runtime dependencies**.
- When compiled with Abseil support enabled (`GTEST_HAS_ABSL`), Abseil flags and utilities are used internally.
- The build system optionally relies on `Threads` package (for pthread) detected via CMake.

<Info>
Building GoogleMock requires GoogleTest as a dependency, but GoogleTest includes the necessary components automatically.
</Info>

---

## 6. Build System Requirements

- **CMake version 3.14 or later** is required to use the built-in FetchContent mechanism for downloading GoogleTest during configuration.
- Compatible with common build systems through CMake including Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio, and Xcode.

---

## 7. Runtime Environment

- Permission to install or access standard system paths (e.g., `/usr/local/include`, `/usr/local/lib`) if installing system-wide.
- Adequate disk space and memory to compile the libraries and tests.

---

## 8. Additional Notes

- On Windows with Visual Studio, a minimum **Visual C++ 2015 (14.0)** compiler is required for GoogleMock.
- The default GoogleTest configuration links the C runtime statically, which may conflict with dynamic runtime settings in your projects. Use CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align runtimes when necessary.

```cmake
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

- GoogleTest macros are provided by default, but if your code base has conflicting macro names, you can redefine them by disabling the default with compile flags, e.g. `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **C++17 not enabled or unsupported**:
  - Verify your compiler version and CMake settings.
- **Threading or pthread-related errors**:
  - Ensure pthread is installed and detected.
  - Adjust `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` flag if necessary.
- **Linker errors related to runtime libraries on Windows**:
  - Check and unify runtime linkage using `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option.

---

## Summary

Before beginning the GoogleTest installation and integration, verify your environment meets the above prerequisites to avoid build and runtime issues. Confirm compiler versions and C++17 standard support, and identify platform-specific installation notes.

For setup instructions building on these requirements, see [Installing with CMake](/getting-started/installation/install-cmake) or [Integration with C++ Environments](/overview/integration-getting-started/integration-with-environments).
