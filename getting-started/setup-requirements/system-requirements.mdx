# System Requirements for GoogleTest

Ensure your development environment meets the necessary specifications to successfully build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page outlines supported C++ standards, compiler versions, platforms, and environment checks you need before setup.

---

## 1. Required C++ Standard

- **Minimum C++ Version**: GoogleTest requires a C++17 compatible compiler.

  > Attempting to build GoogleTest with C++ versions earlier than C++17 will result in an error.

- **Compiler Support**:
  - GoogleTest detects the C++ language version via standard macros (`_MSVC_LANG` for MSVC or `__cplusplus` elsewhere).
  - Ensure your compiler flag enables C++17 or later, for example:
    - GCC/Clang: `-std=c++17`
    - MSVC: default MSVC 2017 Update 3 (`_MSC_VER >= 1911`) or later supports C++17.


## 2. Supported Compilers and Versions

GoogleTest supports a wide range of mainstream compilers, subject to their compliance with C++17:

- **GNU GCC** (version 7.0+ recommended)
- **Clang** (version 3.4.1+ recommended)
- **Microsoft Visual C++** (VS 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later)
- **Intel C++ Compiler** (compatible versions supporting C++17)
- **Other Compilers**: SunPro, IBM Visual Age, HP, and more with C++17 support


## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest targets a broad set of platforms and operating systems:

- **Unix-like systems:** Linux (including Android), macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris
- **Windows variants:** Windows Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, Windows Store / WinRT
- **Specialized platforms:** AIX, z/OS, Haiku, Fuchsia, DragonFlyBSD, GNU/Hurd, Native Client (NaCl), QNX, iOS


> Complete list of recognized platform macros includes `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, among others, which GoogleTest uses to customize builds and runtime behavior.

## 4. Build Environment Checks

- GoogleTest performs automatic detection of available compiler features and platform capabilities. However, this detection may not always be perfect.
- To help build correctly, GoogleTest expects the following:
  - Threading support (pthread or equivalent) where available
  - Proper definition of platform macros (auto-detected)


### Compiler and Feature Detection in Detail

- GoogleTest checks availability of exceptions, RTTI, file system support, and threading libraries at build time.
- The following macros are defined automatically to 1 or 0 based on environment capabilities:
  - `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` (threading support)
  - `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` (exception handling enabled)
  - `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` (runtime type information enabled)
  - `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` (file system access available)
  - `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE` (POSIX regular expression support)
- These can be overridden by users if needed.


## 5. Verifying Your Environment

### Check Compiler Version and Enable C++17

Run your compiler with a check command:

```bash
# GCC
gcc --version
# Clang
clang --version
# MSVC
cl
```

Ensure to pass the correct C++17 flag, for example:

```bash
# Example for GCC/Clang
g++ -std=c++17 -c my_test_file.cc
```


### Validate Platform Support

GoogleTest internally defines platform macros based on compiler and system headers; no user action is needed.

If you encounter build or runtime errors related to platform detection, consider defining in your build configuration:

```
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1       # Force pthread support on
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0       # Disable pthread support if not available
```


## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Using older compilers:** Early versions of many compilers do not fully support C++17; upgrade to a recent stable release.
- **Windows runtime conflicts:** When using Visual Studio, watch for mismatched CRT versions between GoogleTest and your code â€” use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option if needed.
- **Cross-compilation:** Ensure that sysroots and toolchain paths are set correctly; see the `docs/pkgconfig.md` for configuring pkg-config correctly in such environments.

<Tip>
Avoid disabling RTTI or exceptions unless your codebase explicitly requires it, as some GoogleTest features require these.

## 7. Further Reading and Next Steps

- For detailed platform compatibility and supported compilers, see the **Supported Platforms & Compatibility** guide: [/overview/integration-platforms/supported-platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/overview/integration-platforms/supported-platforms.md)
- For setting up your build scripts to comply with these requirements, consult the **Installing with CMake** and **Installing with Bazel** pages in the Getting Started section.
- Review **Troubleshooting and Common Setup Issues** if problems arise when your environment doesn't exactly meet requirements.
