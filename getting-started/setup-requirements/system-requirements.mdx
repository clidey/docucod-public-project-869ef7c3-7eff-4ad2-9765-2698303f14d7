# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

This page provides a detailed overview of the minimum system requirements and supported platforms for using **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock** effectively. Understanding these requirements upfront ensures a smooth environment setup and compatibility throughout your testing workflow.

---

## 1. System Requirements

GoogleTest is designed as a modern C++ testing framework, and as such, it mandates certain baseline requirements in your development environment:

- **C++ Standard**: Your compiler and build environment must support at least **C++17**. This is essential for GoogleTest to compile and operate correctly.
- **Memory and Storage**: Typical modern development machines suffice; no special hardware requirements beyond standard RAM and disk space for your OS and build tools.


## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide range of operating systems and environments following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Key supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (including Windows Desktop, MinGW, and Windows Store App environments)
- **Mac OS X and iOS**
- **BSD variants** (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
- **Other platforms** including Solaris, AIX, and embedded systems with some considerations.

### Platform Compatibility Details

- GoogleTest detects the underlying platform automatically and adapts to handle system-specific features such as file systems, threading libraries, and exception support.
- Some platforms, especially embedded or mobile variants, may have feature limitations (e.g., no POSIX pthread support). GoogleTest accommodates this via platform-specific macros and compile-time options.


## 3. Compiler & Build Tool Support

- Supported compilers include recent versions of **GCC**, **Clang**, **MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or newer)**, **Intel compilers**, and others that comply with the C++17 standard.
- GoogleTest integrates well with build tools like **CMake** and **Bazel**, and provides pkg-config files for convenient dependency management.

### Important Compiler Notes

- When using MSVC, GoogleTest expects static runtime linkage by default but provides options to dynamically link the C runtime to avoid linker errors.
- For compilers or environments that do not fully support exceptions or RTTI, GoogleTest adapts accordingly, but full feature usage may depend on having these enabled.


## 4. Dependencies

- GoogleTest requires threading support via **pthreads** on POSIX systems but includes fallback or disabling options for environments where pthreads are not available.
- **Standard library support** for wide strings and file systems is expected but can be detected and adjusted via macros.


## 5. Environment Preparation

Before beginning your testing setup, prepare your environment by ensuring:

1. Your compiler and linker support C++17 and related flags; for example, you can enforce this in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

2. Required build tools like CMake are installed and available in your PATH. Download CMake free from [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/).

3. For multithreaded tests, ensure pthread support is enabled or explicitly disabled via compiler flags:

```bash
# To enable pthread support explicitly
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1

# To disable pthread support
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

4. On Windows with Visual Studio, align runtime library linkage to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Enable dynamic CRT linkage if required
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```


## 6. Practical Notes and Best Practices

- GoogleTest auto-detects many platform features, but if you encounter build or runtime errors relating to platform capabilities, manually setting macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` or `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` can resolve conflicts.
- When cross-compiling, be aware of sysroot and pkg-config adjustments to correctly locate headers and libraries.
- Stay updated with platform-specific quirks especially if using GoogleMock alongside GoogleTest.


## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<Tip>
If GoogleTest fails to build or run properly on your platform, verify:

- Your compiler's C++ standard compliance.
- Whether threading and exception support flags are correctly defined.
- That your build system is correctly configured to find GoogleTest headers and libraries.
- For Windows, confirm that runtime linkage settings between your project and GoogleTest are consistent.

You can override problematic defaults by setting appropriate compile-time macros documented in the GoogleTest `gtest-port.h`.
