# Running and Interpreting Test Results

This guide walks you through how to compile and run your GoogleTest or GoogleMock test binary, understand the output generated during test execution, and troubleshoot common issues you may encounter. By the end, you will be able to validate your test setup independently and confidently interpret the test results.

---

## 1. Preparing Your Test Binary

Before running tests, ensure your test binary is compiled successfully using your preferred build system (CMake, Bazel, etc.). Your test binary should be linked against GoogleTest and/or GoogleMock libraries and include your test sources.

### Example Build Verification

If you have a `my_tests` executable, verify it builds without errors:

```bash
# Using CMake-generated build system
cmake --build build --target my_tests

# Using Bazel
bazel build //tests:my_tests
```

<Tip>
If the build fails, revisit your project configuration and GoogleTest integration steps. See the [Installing with CMake](../installation/install-cmake) or [Installing with Bazel](../installation/install-bazel) guides for detailed instructions.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Running the Test Binary

Once your test binary is ready, running it will execute all registered tests and print results to standard output.

```bash
./my_tests
```

The output includes:

- The list of test cases and individual tests run.
- Informative messages indicating test progress.
- Detailed failure and error messages if tests fail.
- A summary of the total tests run, passed, and failed.

### Sample Output

```shell
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FooTest
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesThis
[       OK ] FooTest.DoesThis (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesThat
foo_test.cc:119: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  x
  y
[  FAILED  ] FooTest.DoesThat (1 ms)
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesSomethingElse
[       OK ] FooTest.DoesSomethingElse (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FooTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test case ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FooTest.DoesThat

 1 FAILED TEST
```

## 3. Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest outputs real-time information about test execution, designed to be clear and helpful.

### Key Output Components

- `Running main() from gmock_main.cc`: Indicates your tests are starting (from the standard gmock main function).
- `[==========] Running N tests from M test cases.`: Total tests and groups scheduled.
- `[ RUN      ] TestCase.TestName`: Test started running.
- `[       OK ] TestCase.TestName (X ms)`: Test passed successfully with execution time.
- `*** Failure messages ***`: Detailed errors for failed assertions with source location and description.
- `[  FAILED  ]`: Marked tests that failed.
- `[  PASSED  ]`: Marked tests that succeeded.
- Summary showing how many tests passed/failed.

<Tip>
Run your tests with `--gtest_color=yes` for color-coded output, improving readability.

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_color=yes
```
</Tip>

## 4. Command Line Options for Running Tests

GoogleTest supports numerous command-line flags to control test execution and output.

### Commonly Used Flags

| Flag                                   | Description                                  |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter=<filter>`              | Run tests matching the filter (e.g. `FooTest.*`). |
| `--gtest_repeat=<N>`                   | Run tests N times (useful for flaky tests).  |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`             | Abort on the first failed assertion.         |
| `--gtest_output=xml[:path]`            | Output results in XML format (useful for CI).|
| `--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error`  | Control verbosity of GoogleMock output.      |

Example: run only tests in the `MathTest` test case:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MathTest.*
```

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

This section covers frequent problems encountered when running the test binary and how to resolve them.

### Problem: No Tests Run

**Cause:**
- Test binary compiled without any test source files.
- Tests not properly registered.

**Solution:**
- Verify your test files are linked into the executable.
- Check that each test uses `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros correctly.

---

### Problem: Tests Fail Instantly or Report Unknown Errors

**Cause:**
- GoogleTest/GoogleMock initialization not done properly.
- Missing `InitGoogleMock()` or `InitGoogleTest()` call in main.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your main function calls `testing::InitGoogleMock()` or `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before running tests.
- If you use the provided `gmock_main.cc`, this is handled automatically.

---

### Problem: Warning Messages About Uninteresting Mock Calls

This occurs when a mock method is called without an expectation or default action set.

**Solution:**
- Use `ON_CALL()` to set default behaviors for mock methods that will be called but not explicitly expected.
- Alternatively, wrap your mock object in `NiceMock<>` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockClass> mock;
```

---

### Problem: Test Hangs or Runs Forever

**Cause:**
- Tests with infinite loops or waiting on untriggered notifications.

**Solution:**
- Run with timeout tools to detect where the hang occurs.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to catch and debug failing tests early.

---

## 6. Verifying GoogleMock Output

GoogleMock emits detailed messages when expectations are met, violated, or when unexpected/uninteresting calls occur.

### Controlling Output Verbosity

Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag:

- `info`: Prints all informational, warning, and error messages (most verbose, includes stack traces).
- `warning`: Prints warnings and errors (default, no stack traces for warnings).
- `error`: Prints errors only (least verbose).

Example:

```bash
./my_tests --gmock_verbose=info
```

### Recognizing Mock Call Messages

- **Expected calls:** Message indicating a call matched an expectation.
- **Unexpected calls:** Failure message showing an unexpected call with details of mismatch.
- **Uninteresting calls:** Warning about calls with no expectation or default action.

<Tip>
Review the detailed mock call messages under `--gmock_verbose=info` when debugging complex mock interactions.
</Tip>
