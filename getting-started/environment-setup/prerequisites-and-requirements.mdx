# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the foundational requirements before installing and building GoogleTest. This proactive step prevents common compatibility issues and smooths the path toward integrating the framework into your projects.

---

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform but has specific requirements regarding compilers and platforms it supports effectively:

- **Operating Systems**:
  - Linux (common distributions with standard libraries)
  - Windows (via Visual Studio or compatible tooling)
  - macOS (Xcode environment supported)

- **Compilers**:
  - GCC (version supporting C++17)
  - Clang (version supporting C++17)
  - Microsoft Visual Studio (with C++17 support)

Compatibility for other compilers or older versions is not guaranteed.

## Minimum C++ Standard

- Your build environment **must** support **C++17**. GoogleTest requires features and language constructs from this standard to compile and function correctly.

- To enforce this:
  - For CMake projects, set the standard explicitly:

    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```

  - Alternatively, pass the following flags during cmake configuration:

    ```sh
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17"
    ```

## Build Tools

GoogleTest leverages standard build systems, with **CMake** being the primary supported tool:

- **CMake (version 3.14 or later)**
  - Required for building GoogleTest and integrating it into other projects.
  - Enables easy build-file generation that works across platforms.

- Other build tools (like make, Visual Studio native builds, Xcode) are supported indirectly through CMake-generated projects or solution files.

## Additional Dependencies and Options

- **Git**
  - Needed for cloning the GoogleTest repository or pulling specific versions.

- **For multi-threaded builds:**
  - GoogleTest automatically detects pthread support.
  - If detection fails, explicitly specify pthread availability using compiler flags:

    ```sh
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enables pthread support
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disables pthread support
    ```

- **Shared Library Builds**
  - Optionally, to build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows), use:

    ```sh
    -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
    ```

  - Ensure to link tests compiled against the shared library with:

    ```sh
    -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
    ```

## System Requirements

- **Memory & Disk Space:** Minimal requirements; depends mostly on build tools.

- **Network Access:** Required if downloading dependencies or using CMake's `FetchContent` to pull GoogleTest sources automatically.

## Access and Permissions

- You need appropriate read access to clone or download the GoogleTest source.

- Sufficient permissions to install (if running `make install` or similar system-wide installation commands).

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Specify C++ Standard Globally:** Ensure your entire project and build scripts consistently use C++17 to avoid subtle incompatibilities.

- **Use Official Releases:** Clone tagged versions (e.g., `v1.17.0`) instead of master to avoid unstable changes.

- **Verify Compiler Support:** Some older compilers may claim C++17 support but still miss critical features needed by GoogleTest.

- **Consistency in Threading:** Explicitly manage threading options, especially on POSIX systems, to avoid linking issues.

- **Visual Studio Runtime Compatibility:** Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to prevent runtime library mismatches.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` or not enabling C++17 features.
- Building with incompatible or outdated compilers.
- Missing pthread linkage on POSIX systems requiring manual interventions.
- Using unsupported build tools without CMake intermediary.

---

## Verification

After setting up your environment:

1. Clone the GoogleTest repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
   cd googletest
   ```

2. Create and enter the build directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. Configure the build with CMake:

   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build GoogleTest:

   ```sh
   make
   ```

5. (Optional) Install if system-wide use is intended:

   ```sh
   sudo make install
   ```

If these steps complete without error, your prerequisites are correctly met.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to the [Installing with CMake](../installation-integration/installing-via-cmake.md) guide for detailed build and integration instructions.

- Review [Supported Platforms](../environment-setup/supported-platforms.md) for detailed compatibility information.

- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../troubleshooting-resources/troubleshooting-common-issues.md) page if you encounter build or environment errors.
