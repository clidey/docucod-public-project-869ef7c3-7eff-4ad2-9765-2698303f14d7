# Project Structure Overview

Orient yourself to the merged GoogleTest and GoogleMock repository layout. Discover where key files, documentation, and sample code reside, so you can confidently locate what you need throughout your testing workflows.

---

## Repository Layout

The GoogleTest and GoogleMock frameworks have been merged into a single repository. This unified structure helps streamline development and usage. Understanding where files, headers, and samples reside is crucial for effective workflow and troubleshooting.

### Root Directory Structure

- **googletest/**
  - Core GoogleTest framework source code and headers.
  - Contains the basic test macros, assertions, and test utilities.
- **googlemock/**
  - GoogleMock framework source code and headers.
  - Includes the mocking framework used for defining mock classes, expectation setting, and mock behavior.
- **docs/**
  - Documentation files covering user guides, reference materials, examples, and cookbook recipes.
  - Valuable for learning the usage patterns and extending your testing skills.
- **samples/**
  - A rich set of example test code demonstrating how to write tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
  - Great starting points for understanding API usage and common patterns.

> Both `googletest/` and `googlemock/` subdirectories include their own `README.md` which provide framework-specific context and instructions.

## Important Files and Directories

| Directory/File             | Purpose                                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `googletest/include/gtest` | GoogleTest public headers                             |
| `googletest/src`           | GoogleTest source implementation                       |
| `googlemock/include/gmock` | GoogleMock public headers                              |
| `googlemock/src`           | GoogleMock source implementation                        |
| `docs/`                   | User guides, API references, tutorials, and cookbooks |
| `samples/`                | Sample test programs showcasing framework features     |
| `CMakeLists.txt`          | Build instructions supporting both GoogleTest and GoogleMock |

### Key Documentation within the Repository

- **GoogleTest Primer (`docs/primer.md`)**
  - Learn basics of writing tests with GoogleTest.
- **Mocking for Dummies (`docs/gmock_for_dummies.md`)**
  - Dive into GoogleMock basics and tutorials.
- **Mocking Reference (`docs/reference/mocking.md`)**
  - Detailed macro and class references for mocking.
- **gMock Cookbook (`docs/gmock_cook_book.md`)**
  - Examples and patterns for advanced mocking.
- **gMock Cheat Sheet (`docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md`)**
  - Quick reference for mock-related macros and concepts.

## Location of Sample Code

- **`samples/`**
  - Contains multiple sample test cases illustrating different capabilities:
    - Basic and advanced tests
    - Mock classes and expectations
    - Parameterized and typed tests
    - Integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock

> Reviewing these samples accelerates practical understanding and can serve as boilerplate for your own testing.

## Source Code Highlights

- **Header Inclusion**
  - To use GoogleMock, include `<gmock/gmock.h>` which pulls in all necessary headers.
- **Build System**
  - The repository contains build files supporting modern systems, primarily via CMake.
  - GoogleMock is part of the GoogleTest build and can be enabled or disabled via build flags.

## Locating Mock Class Definitions

When creating mock classes using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro:

- Place your mock class definitions preferably near or within the same Bazel or CMake package as the interface it mocks.
- Common practice is to locate mock headers under a `testing/` subdirectory or alongside the code owning the interface.
- This centralizes maintenance and minimizes test breakage when the interface evolves.

> See [gMock for Dummies](docs/gmock_for_dummies.md) and [Mocking Reference](docs/reference/mocking.md) for comprehensive guidance on defining and using mocks.

## Navigating Test Fixtures and Expectations

- Test fixtures are defined using GoogleTest's `testing::Test` and derivatives.
- Mock methods and expectations use macros like `MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`, and `ON_CALL`.
- Supporting documents and samples provide clear, actionable syntax examples.

## Recommended Workflow for New Users

1. **Understand the Directory Layout**
   - Explore `googletest/` and `googlemock/` directories to understand source locations.
2. **Read Primer Documentation**
   - Start with `docs/primer.md` to grasp the basics of writing tests.
3. **Learn Mocking Concepts**
   - Proceed to `docs/gmock_for_dummies.md` to understand mock object usage.
4. **Examine Sample Test Code**
   - Study samples in `samples/` to see integration in action.
5. **Consult References as Needed**
   - Use `docs/reference/mocking.md` and `docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md` as quick lookup resources.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Familiarize yourself with the `MOCK_METHOD` macro syntax by reviewing the mock class examples in the `docs/gmock_cook_book.md` and cheat sheet.
- Stay within the conventions of placing mocks and tests close to the code they are related to.
- Use the provided documentation to help troubleshoot build and usage issues.

<Tip>
Remember that the merged repo structure means you don't have to hunt multiple repos. Using the provided documentation paths, you can quickly locate the exact info you need whether it's about writing tests, mocks, or composing expectations.
