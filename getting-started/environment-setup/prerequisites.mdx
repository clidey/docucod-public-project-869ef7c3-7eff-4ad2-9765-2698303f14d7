# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin installing GoogleTest, it's essential to ensure your development environment meets the necessary requirements. Setting up the right system configuration upfront saves time and avoids common installation pitfalls.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler that supports **C++17** or later.

- Ensure your compiler is set to compile with the **C++17** standard or higher.
  - For example, with GCC or Clang, use the flag:

  ```bash
  -std=c++17
  ```

- Older standards such as C++11 or C++14 are not supported and will cause build failures.

<Tip>
Using C++17 enables GoogleTest to leverage modern language features for improved safety, correctness, and performance.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide range of commonly used development platforms and operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (including MSVC tools)
- **Mac OS X**

Ensure your system is one of the supported platforms to guarantee smooth integration.

<Note>
Platform-specific quirks or older versions of operating systems might cause issues. For best results, keep your OS updated.
</Note>

## 3. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest compiles with multiple compilers given they support C++17:

- **GCC 7 or higher**
- **Clang 5 or higher**
- **MSVC 2017 Update 15.7 or higher**

Always verify your compiler version supports C++17 features.

<Warning>
Attempting to build GoogleTest with compilers lacking full C++17 support leads to obscure compilation errors.
</Warning>

## 4. Required Tools and Dependencies

Before building GoogleTest, ensure the following are installed and accessible in your environment:

- **CMake (version 3.14 or newer)**
  - GoogleTest uses CMake to generate build files for various platforms.
  - Download CMake from <https://cmake.org/download/>.

- **Make, Ninja, or Visual Studio Build Tools**
  - Depending on your platform, you'll need a build tool.
  - For Linux and Mac OS X, `make` or `ninja` is typical.
  - For Windows, Visual Studio or MSBuild is required.

<Tip>
Using the latest stable versions of CMake and your build tools will prevent compatibility issues.
</Tip>

## 5. Network and Firewall Requirements

- No special network or firewall settings are required to use GoogleTest locally.
- If downloading via Git, ensure Git access to <https://github.com/google/googletest> is not blocked.

<Info>
For corporate or restricted network environments, verify you have GitHub repository access.
</Info>

## 6. Additional Notes

- GoogleTest is distributed with GoogleMock included. For users only using GoogleTest, you may disable GoogleMock during build (see installation instructions).

- Threading support depends on your environment's pthread availability. For threading, make sure your platform supports POSIX threads or equivalent.

<Check>
Confirm your environment's pthread support if you plan to run multi-threaded tests.
</Check>

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

| Issue                                    | Resolution                                           |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Unsupported compiler version              | Upgrade your compiler to a version that supports C++17 |
| Missing CMake or outdated version         | Install or upgrade CMake to version 3.14 or higher  |
| Build tool missing or incompatible        | Install make, ninja, or Visual Studio build tools accordingly |
| Firewall blocking GitHub access           | Work with your network admin to whitelist access to GitHub |

## Summary

Before installation of GoogleTest:

1. Ensure your compiler supports C++17.
2. Verify your platform is Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X.
3. Have CMake (3.14+) and build tools installed.
4. Confirm network access for cloning the repository.

Following these prerequisites guarantees a hassle-free setup and build of GoogleTest.
