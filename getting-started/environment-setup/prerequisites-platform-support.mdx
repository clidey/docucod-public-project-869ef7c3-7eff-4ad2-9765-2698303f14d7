# Prerequisites & Platform Support

This page outlines the essential requirements and supported environments for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Before installing or integrating these frameworks into your projects, ensure your platform, compiler, and tools meet the minimum criteria to avoid compatibility issues and setup delays.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a C++17-compliant compiler environment.

- **Language Standard**: Your compiler must support at least C++17.
- **Verification**: You can enforce this in your build system with flags such as `-std=c++17` or by setting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 in CMake.

> Attempting to build with older C++ standards will result in compilation errors.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide range of common operating systems and platforms conforming to Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. Support is most stable and tested on:

- Linux (including various distributions)
- Windows Desktop (MSVC, MinGW)
- macOS (including Xcode)
- Android (Linux variant with supported NDK)

Additional platforms with partial or emerging support include:

- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
- GNU/Hurd
- Others (Haiku, QNX, Fuchsia, and embedded platforms with restrictions)


### Platform Detection

GoogleTest auto-detects the platform at compile time via macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, and others. Unless working in highly customized or embedded environments, manual intervention is rarely needed.


## 3. Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have been successfully compiled and tested on the following compilers:

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 Update 3 or later (MSVC 19.11+)
- GCC 7.0 or later
- Clang 3.4.1 or later
- Intel LLVM
- SunPro C++ Compiler
- IBM Visual Age (limited support)

The framework requires basic support for C++17 features including but not limited to:

- Variadic templates
- Inline variables
- constexpr enhancements


## 4. Threading and Concurrency Requirements

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`).
- On Windows, native synchronization primitives are used.
- To build with pthread support, your environment must provide the pthreads library. Disable pthreads with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if unsupported.


## 5. Tooling and Build System Requirements

- **Build System**: GoogleTest provides official support via CMake scripts. Versions 3.14 or later are recommended for smooth integration.

- **Linking**:
  - GoogleTest can be built either as a static library (default) or as a shared library (`-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`).
  - When building tests that link against a shared GoogleTest library, define `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

- **On Windows**, be aware of runtime linking conflicts between static and dynamic CRTs. Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align runtime linkage with your project settings.


## 6. Macros for Environment Tweaks and Customization

GoogleTest offers a range of compile-time macros to customize behavior or override automatic environment detection:

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` forces enabled or disabled pthread support.
- `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` enables building GoogleTest as a shared library.
- `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` marks builds that link to GoogleTest as shared.
- `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` indicates if GoogleTestâ€™s internal threading support is active (set automatically).

Refer to [gtest-port.h](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) for a full list of macros.


## 7. File System and Stream Redirection Support

- Death tests and output capturing require file system access and stream redirection capabilities.
- These are available on most desktop platforms but disabled on some embedded/mobile ones (like Windows Phone, Windows RT, ESP8266).


## 8. Summary Table: Platform and Feature Support

| Feature/Platform           | Support Status                         | Notes                                        |

| Windows Desktop           | Full                                 | MSVC and MinGW                               |
| macOS                     | Full                                 | Including iOS with some restrictions         |
| FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD| Partial                              | May lack full testing coverage                |
| Solaris                   | Partial                              |                                              |
| Embedded (ESP32, QURT, etc)| Limited                             | No file system, no stream redirection         |
| Threading (pthreads)      | Enabled where pthreads available     | Use compile flags to override if needed      |
| Exceptions Support        | Auto-detected                       | Can be overridden with macros                 |
| RTTI Support              | Auto-detected                       | Required for some GoogleTest features         |


## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Compiler errors related to C++ versions?** Ensure the compiler is at least C++17 compliant.

- **Missing pthread support?** Add `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or properly link with pthread library.

- **Linker errors on Windows?** Confirm `gtest_force_shared_crt` is set to match your project.

- **Platform not detected or unsupported?** Manually define platform macros or consider contribution for platform support.
