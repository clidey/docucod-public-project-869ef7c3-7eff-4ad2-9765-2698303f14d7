# Supported Platforms

This page provides a clear overview of the operating systems, compilers, and environments where GoogleTest and GoogleMock are officially supported. It is designed to help you quickly understand the compatibility landscape and find detailed references for specific platform and toolchain versions.

---

## 1. Overview of Supported Platforms

GoogleTest adheres strictly to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This policy guides the selection of supported platforms and toolchains to ensure high stability, portability, and maintainability.

Officially supported platforms include, but are not limited to:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop editions and MinGW)
- **Mac OS X** (including macOS and iOS variants where appropriate)
- **BSD variants** (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
- **Solaris and AIX**

In addition, GoogleTest supports many common embedded and Unix-like environments with varying degrees of feature support.

<Note>
If you use a less common or emerging platform, GoogleTest may partially work but without official stability guarantees. Community feedback and patches are welcomed.
</Note>

## 2. Supported Compilers and Build Environments

GoogleTest requires a **C++17-compatible compiler** with features matching at least those provided by recent releases of:

- GCC 7 or newer
- Clang 5 or newer
- MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or newer)
- Intel Compiler versions compatible with C++17

Supported build tools include:

- CMake (minimum version 3.16 recommended for best support)
- Bazel (community-supported with official build files provided)
- Manual build systems, including Makefile-based and custom scripts

For Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio is supported, supporting both static and shared library builds.

## 3. Feature Compatibility Notes

GoogleTest adapts its features depending on platform capabilities and compiler support:

- **Threading and synchronization:** Enabled by default where POSIX pthreads or Windows threading APIs are available. Can be disabled if unsupported.
- **Regex support:** Uses Abseil’s RE2 on platforms configured with Abseil; otherwise, POSIX regex or a simple regex engine is used.
- **Exceptions and RTTI:** Detected automatically. If your environment disables exceptions or RTTI, GoogleTest adjusts accordingly.
- **File system and I/O:** Required for some advanced features like death tests and stream redirection.

<Tip>
Use the `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro after including `<gtest/gtest.h>` to detect thread safety support in your build.
</Tip>

## 4. Finding Detailed Compatibility Information

For exact versions of supported platforms, compilers, and build tools, refer to:

- Google's foundational support matrix:
  [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

- The official GoogleTest repository and issues for updates on newer platform support

- The file `googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h` in the source code, which contains macros that GoogleTest uses to detect platform and feature support during compilation.

## 5. Using GoogleTest on Your Platform

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Verify your compiler supports C++17 or later.**
   You can test this by running:

   ```bash
   ${CXX} --version
   ```

   And ensuring the compiler is GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or MSVC VS2017+.

2. **Check platform macros and capabilities.**

   GoogleTest will automatically detect the following key features during compilation:

   - `GTEST_OS_<PLATFORM>` macros indicating your OS
   - `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` for threading support
   - `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` for exception support
   - `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` for RTTI
   - `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` for file I/O support

3. **Adjust your build flags if needed.**

   For example, if GoogleTest improperly detects pthread support, explicitly define:

   ```bash
   -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # or 0 to disable
   ```

4. **If you plan to build GoogleTest as a shared library on Windows, add:**

   ```bash
   -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1  # When building gtest itself
   -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1  # When building tests linking with shared gtest
   ```

5. **Consult the `README.md` and `docs/platforms.md` for additional environmental guidance.**

## 6. Troubleshooting Platform Issues

Common issues primarily arise from mismatched compiler support or threading support. Here are tips:

- **Build fails due to missing pthread flags:**

  Add appropriate `-pthread` flags to both compile and link commands.

- **Exceptions disabled:**

  GoogleTest adjusts, but some features like death tests may be limited.

- **Unsupported or partial platform:**

  Features like file system or stream redirection may not work. Run tests cautiously.

<Warning>
If you encounter a platform or compiler issue not covered in official docs, consider submitting a patch or filing a bug with details.
</Warning>
