# Next Steps: Learning the Basics

Welcome to the next phase of your GoogleTest and GoogleMock journey. This guide introduces you to foundational concepts, best practices, and essential tutorials that will empower you to write effective, maintainable, and robust tests. After successfully installing and validating your test environment, these materials will help you lay a solid groundwork for developing productive unit and integration tests.

---

## Why Learn the Basics?

Understanding core concepts and workflows will accelerate your mastery of GoogleTest's powerful testing capabilities. It will help you avoid common pitfalls, write tests that are easy to read and maintain, and effectively use mocking to isolate and verify behaviors in your code.

## What You Will Learn Here

This page guides you through foundational resources covering:

- Key terminology and concepts in GoogleTest and GoogleMock
- How to write and organize your first unit tests
- Creating mock objects to simulate dependencies
- Crafting meaningful expectations and assertions
- Best practices for test design and maintenance

Whether you are new to testing or coming from other frameworks, these topics set the stage for success.

## Recommended Reading and Tutorials

### 1. [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md)

Discover GoogleTest's core features, including test structure, basic assertions, and test fixtures. This primer helps you build confidence in writing straightforward tests.

### 2. [gMock for Dummies](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md)

A gentle introduction to using GoogleMock. Learn how mocks differ from fakes, mock class creation, setting expectations, and verifying interactions.

### 3. [gMock Cookbook](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md)

Explore practical recipes and patterns for creating mocks, specifying behaviors, and customizing expectations with matchers and actions.

### 4. [Matchers Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/matchers.md)

Master the wide variety of built-in matchers for flexible and expressive argument validation.

### 5. [Configuring Your First Test Project](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/installation-setup/config-first-project.md)

After learning the basics, integrate test cases into your build system effectively.

## Tips to Accelerate Your Test Development

- **Practice By Example:** Write simple tests for small components using mocks to understand behavior-driven testing.
- **Keep Tests Focused:** Each test should verify one responsibility.
- **Start with ON_CALL:** Use `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying important interactions.
- **Watch the Order:** Expectations in GoogleMock apply in reverse order of declaration — newer expectations override older ones.
- **Use NiceMock When Unsure:** To reduce noise, wrap mock objects with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings about uninteresting calls.
- **Leverage Verbosity Flags:** Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed insights into mock interactions for debugging.

---

## Additional Learning Path

Once comfortable with the basics, consider exploring more advanced topics such as:

- Parameterized and typed tests for comprehensive coverage
- Using sequences and ordering expectations for complex interaction patterns
- Writing custom matchers and actions for greater expressiveness
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines and build environments
