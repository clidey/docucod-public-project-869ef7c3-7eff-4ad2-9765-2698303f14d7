# Supported Platforms & Compilers

Ensure your development environment is compatible with GoogleTest before installation by reviewing this comprehensive list of officially supported platforms, operating systems, and compilers. Compatibility is essential to guarantee smooth building, linking, and execution of your tests.

---

## 1. Overview of Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports all mainstream desktop and server platforms, adhering closely to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This ensures portability and consistent behavior across environments.

Supported operating systems include:

| Platform           | Notes                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows            | Desktop (Win32), Windows Mobile, MinGW, Windows Phone, Windows RT    |
| macOS              | Requires Xcode or compatible build tools                             |
| Linux              | General Linux distros including Android (via Linux on Android)       |
| Unix-like Systems  | FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, QNX     |
| Embedded Platforms | ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52, NXP QN9090, XTENSA, QuRT                      |
| Other Platforms    | Cygwin, OS/2, GNU/Hurd, Fuchsia, Haiku, z/OS                         |

> **Tip:** GoogleTest uses platform detection macros internally to provide tailored behavior for each platform.


## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports C++17. The minimum versions supported typically include:

| Compiler           | Minimum Supported Version                   | Notes                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| GCC                | 7.4.0+                                     | Recommended for Linux systems          |
| Clang              | 5.0+                                       | Supports Mac, Linux                    |
| Microsoft Visual C++| Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 (MSVC 14.11) or later | Supports Windows                    |
| Intel C++          | Compatible versions with C++17 support    | Detected as IntelLLVM in some cases    |
| Other Compilers     | SunPro, XL, HP aCC with C++17 support      | Support as per platform availability   |

GoogleTest includes internal tweaks for compiler flags to optimize warnings and runtime behavior per compiler (e.g., adjusting MSVC warning levels or Clang strictness).


## 3. Platform and Compiler Feature Compatibility

GoogleTest dynamically detects or can be forced to recognize the capabilities of your environment, including:

- **Exception support:** Enabled or disabled based on compiler flags.
- **RTTI availability:** GoogleTest adapts behavior depending on RTTI support.
- **Threading support:** Enables multi-threaded tests when pthreads or native threading are available.
- **File system presence:** Required for certain tests like death tests and output capture.

For embedded platforms or unusual systems without full feature sets, GoogleTest compiles with limited capabilities.


## 4. Detection and Build Behavior

GoogleTest uses a combination of compiler identification and platform macros to adjust its build process:

- **Platform Detection Macros:** Internally defined macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and many others determine OS-specific adaptations.
- **Compiler Identification:** Uses CMake-detected compiler IDs and version checks.
- **Compiler Flag Adjustments:** Custom flags optimize warnings, runtime library linkage, and exception handling:

  - On MSVC, GoogleTest ensures static runtime linking by default to avoid runtime conflicts but can switch to dynamic linking via the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option.
  - On Clang and GCC, stricter warning flags are enabled to catch potential issues early.


## 5. Platform Summary Table

| Operating System / Platform             | Supported Compilers                | Special Notes                                         |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile)      | MSVC 2017+, MinGW GCC 7.4+, Clang| Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` to match runtimes       |
| macOS (Xcode)                        | Clang (Xcode default)             | Full compatibility, requires C++17 support            |
| Linux (including Android)              | GCC 7.4+, Clang 5.0+              | Android requires API level 9+ for pthread support     |
| FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD| GCC, Clang                      | Typical POSIX environment                              |
| Solaris, AIX, HP-UX                   | Compiler-dependent                | Tested with respective system compilers               |
| Embedded (ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52, etc.)| Compiler toolchains vary         | Limited feature set, minimal standard library support |
| Others (OS/2, GNU/Hurd, Fuchsia, Haiku, z/OS) | Varies | Check platform-specific constraints and features    |


## 6. Compiler Feature Flags and Tweaks

GoogleTest configures compiler and linker flags internally through `cmake/internal_utils.cmake`:

- Overrides default CMake flags for MSVC and Clang to increase warning levels (`/W4` on MSVC and `-Wall -Wshadow` on Clang).
- Adjusts runtime library options to avoid mismatches (`/MT` vs `/MD` on MSVC).
- Defines feature macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` based on system threading capabilities.
- Manages special flags for exception handling, RTTI, and shared-library usage.


## 7. How to Verify Your Platform Compatibility

### Step 1: Check Operating System

Ensure your OS is among the supported ones listed above.

### Step 2: Check Compiler and Version

Run:

```sh
<compiler> --version
```

Verify your compiler meets the minimum required version for C++17 support.

### Step 3: Verify C++17 Support

Try compiling a small snippet with the `-std=c++17` or equivalent flag enabled.

### Step 4: Consult Official Compatibility Matrix

Check the official Google's [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for your platform and compiler combination.


## 8. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Visual Studio Runtime Errors:** If you encounter linker errors related to runtime mismatches (e.g., `MT` vs `MD`), enable the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake:

  ```sh
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

- **Pthreads on MinGW:** GoogleTest disables pthread support on MinGW due to incompatibilities and uses native Windows threading instead.
- **Exceptions and RTTI:** If you compile GoogleTest with exceptions or RTTI disabled, expect some features to be limited. GoogleTest detects these and adjusts accordingly.

*This page is part of the Getting Started documentation set, focusing specifically on ensuring your development environment is compatible before you begin installation and setup.*

### Example: Verify Your Platform from Command Line

```sh
# On Linux / macOS
gcc --version
clang --version
uname -a

# On Windows (PowerShell)
cl
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
```


If your compiler or OS version falls outside supported ranges, upgrade your toolchain or consider a supported environment for best results.

<Tip>
If you are using embedded or less common platforms, GoogleTest may compile with reduced features or require custom tweaks. Always check the internal platform detection macros and consult GoogleTest source/config files for guidance.
</Tip>


<Note>
GoogleTest requires a C++17 compatible compiler; recent versions of popular compilers meet this requirement. Older versions will fail with compile-time errors.
