# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare your development environment for smooth integration with GoogleTest by ensuring the following compilers, C++ standards, platform constraints, and tooling are in place. Setting up correctly upfront will save you time and prevent frustrating installation or runtime issues.

---

## 1. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a compiler with **full support for the C++17 standard or newer**. The following compilers are supported:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) version 7.0 and above
- **Clang** 5 and above
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) 2017 Update 3 or later
- **Intel LLVM** compatible with C++17

Any compiler not meeting these minimum requirements will not successfully compile GoogleTest.

<Tip>
Always verify your compiler version before attempting to build GoogleTest to avoid unexpected errors.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Minimum C++ Standard: C++17

GoogleTest strictly requires an environment that supports the **C++17 standard or newer**. It uses language features and standard library components introduced in this standard.

To ensure this:

- When using **CMake**, set the following in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- When building manually or with other build systems, ensure that your compiler flags include appropriate options, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang, or specify the correct language standard in your IDE settings.

<Warning>
Using C++ standards older than C++17 will lead to build-time failures or undefined behavior.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Platform Constraints

GoogleTest supports the primary desktop platforms:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (desktop versions)
- **macOS**

It detects the platform automatically and adapts accordingly. Note the following considerations:

- **Threads and Synchronization**: GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support.
- **Exceptions**: It's recommended to compile with exceptions enabled for full feature support, although GoogleTest can be used in exception-free builds.

<Note>
Some specialized or embedded platforms are not supported due to lack of thread libraries or file system support.
</Note>

---

## 4. Tooling Requirements

You will need the following tools installed and configured to successfully use GoogleTest:

- **Build Tools**:
  - **CMake** (version 3.14 or higher recommended) for cross-platform build configuration.
  - Native toolchain matching your platform (e.g., GNU Make, MSBuild, Ninja).

- **Git** (optional but recommended): To clone GoogleTest source directly if building from source.

- **Pkg-config** (especially on Linux/macOS): Can help discover compiler and linker flags.

- **System Libraries**:
  - Standard C++ library with C++17 support.
  - pthreads (POSIX threads) for multi-threading support on Linux/macOS.

---

## 5. Environment Tuning Macros (Optional)

GoogleTest supports some user-tweakable macros to adjust or force environment-specific settings during compilation. These are advanced configurations, typically set via compiler flags.

Common macros include:

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` to force enabling or disabling pthread support.
- `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when compiling GoogleTest as a shared library.
- `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when linking tests against a shared GoogleTest.

Unless you have specialized requirements, the defaults detected automatically by GoogleTest suffice.

<Tip>
Refer to [`gtest-port.h`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) for a complete list of macros.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Key Compiler Flags and Configuration

GoogleTest’s build scripts and CMake files set compiler flags optimized for various compilers to ensure:

- Strict warnings (`-W4` for MSVC, `-Wall -Wshadow` for GCC/Clang).
- C++17 language standard compliance.
- Runtime library linking consistency (static vs. dynamic linking).

If you build GoogleTest manually, ensure your compiler flags match these guidelines.

<Note>
On Windows, the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option can help resolve runtime library linkage conflicts between GoogleTest and your project.
</Note>

---

## 7. Verifying Your Environment

Before installing or building GoogleTest, confirm the following:

- Your **compiler is C++17 compliant and is the expected version or newer**.
- Your **build system supports CMake 3.14+** if using CMake.
- Your **platform is supported** and pthreads / threading is available if multithreading is needed.
- The required **tools (git, pkg-config)** are installed if you plan to build from source.

Use the compiler’s version command (e.g., `gcc --version`, `cl.exe`, `clang --version`) and `cmake --version` to check.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Supporting C++17">
If your compiler is too old:

- Update to a supported version.
- Alternatively, adjust your compiler flags or toolchain to use a newer compiler.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthreads on Linux/macOS">
- Ensure development packages are installed (e.g., `libpthread` or kernel headers).
- Use the build system’s package finder capabilities (e.g., CMake `find_package(Threads)`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Tool Versions Too Low">
- Upgrade CMake to version 3.14 or later.
- Verify your build environment supports necessary features.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linkage Conflicts on Windows">
- Use CMake's `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to align runtime library linkage.
- Review your project’s runtime linkage to match GoogleTest's.
