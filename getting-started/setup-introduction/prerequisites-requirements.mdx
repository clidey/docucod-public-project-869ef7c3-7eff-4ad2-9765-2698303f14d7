# Prerequisites and System Requirements

This page details the essential compiler support, platforms, and C++ standards you need to have in place to build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock successfully. Ensuring your environment meets these prerequisites will help you avoid build or runtime issues when integrating and running your first tests.

---

## 1. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require modern C++17-compatible compilers. The following compilers have proven support:

- **GCC 7.1** and above
- **Clang 5.0** and above
- **MSVC 2017** (Visual Studio 2017) and above

> Note: Even if your compiler claims support for C++17, always verify that it does so without major bugs by testing a minimal C++17 project.

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be portable across major operating systems and platforms:

- **Windows** (desktop and server editions)
- **Linux** distributions
- **macOS**
- Embedded platforms that support C++17

The framework avoids platform-specific calls, relying on the C++ standard library and cross-platform abstractions wherever possible.

## 3. Minimum C++ Standard

Both GoogleTest and GoogleMock require your project to be built with **at least C++17** support enabled. This ensures access to language features and library enhancements needed for both frameworks to compile and function correctly.

### Enabling C++17

Most modern build systems and compilers support a flag to specify the C++ standard. For example:

- **GCC and Clang:** Use `-std=c++17`
- **MSVC:** Use `/std:c++17`

Ensure that this flag is set consistently across your build process.

## 4. Additional Environment Considerations

- **Threading Support:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock may utilize threading features. Make sure your platform and compiler support `pthread` on Unix-like systems or native threading on Windows.

- **Build Tools:**
  - `cmake` or `bazel` are supported build systems that facilitate integration.
  - Manual builds using `make` or other tools require your environment to be set up accordingly.

- **Linking Dependencies:**
  - When using shared libraries on Windows, ensure the runtime libraries are consistent to avoid linking conflicts.
  - On Unix, linking to pthreads (`-lpthread`) might be necessary.

## 5. Validation Tips

After configuring your environment, verify you can build the test binaries without errors:

```shell
# Example with CMake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 ..
cmake --build .
```

Running the test suite (`RUN_ALL_TESTS()`) should complete without unexpected failures, indicating your environment is properly set up.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to set the C++ standard to C++17 or above will result in compile errors.
- Mixing runtime library types, especially on Windows (static vs dynamic CRT), can cause linking failures.
- Using outdated compiler versions lacking proper C++17 implementation will lead to subtle compilation or runtime errors.

<Tip>
Always ensure your compiler is up-to-date and that all build and linking flags are consistent. Mismatched configurations are a frequent cause of build issues.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Utilize `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers judiciously to control warning and error reporting during tests, adapting to your development or CI environment needs.
</Tip>
