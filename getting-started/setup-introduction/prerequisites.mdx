# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the minimum system requirements and essential dependencies needed to successfully build and run GoogleMock, which requires a C++17-compliant environment and specific tool versions. Before proceeding with installation or usage, ensure your development environment meets the criteria and verify your configuration accordingly.

---

## 1. System Requirements

- **C++ Standard:**
  - GoogleMock requires support for C++17 features. Your compiler and standard library must fully support the C++17 standard.

- **Supported Compilers and Versions:**
  - **GCC:** Version 7.4 or later
  - **Clang:** Version 5.0 or later
  - **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or later

- **Supported Operating Systems:**
  - Linux distributions with compatible compilers
  - macOS with Xcode supporting the above compilers
  - Microsoft Windows with supported Visual Studio version

- **Hardware:**
  - Typical modern development machine; no special hardware requirements beyond those needed for your chosen operating system and compiler.


## 2. External Tools and Dependencies

- **Build Systems Supported:**
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (Recommended for manual builds and integration)
  - [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) (Supported for integration; preferred in some environments)

- **Required Tool Versions:**
  - CMake version 3.12 or newer
  - Bazel version 3.x or newer (if used)

- **Standard Library:**
  - Must provide C++17 standard library support as required by GoogleMock.


## 3. Verifying Your Environment

Before starting your build or test development, perform these checks:

### 3.1 Verify Compiler and C++ Standard Support

Run the following commands to check your compiler version and test C++17 support.

#### GCC
```bash
gcc --version
```
Expected minimum version output example:
```
gcc (GCC) 7.4.0
```
To test C++17 support:
```bash
echo | gcc -x c++ - -std=c++17 -dM -E | grep __cplusplus
```
Expected output:
```
#define __cplusplus 201703L
```

#### Clang
```bash
clang --version
```
Expected minimum version example:
```
Apple clang version 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5) or Clang 5.0
```
To test C++17 support:
```bash
echo | clang -x c++ - -std=c++17 -dM -E | grep __cplusplus
```
Expected output:
```
#define __cplusplus 201703L
```

#### MSVC
Check Visual Studio version from IDE or via command line by:
```powershell
cl
```
Expected output indicates version 19.x (corresponds to VS2017 or later).


### 3.2 Verify CMake/Bazel

Check the installed versions of your build systems.

#### CMake
```bash
cmake --version
```
Expected minimum:
```
cmake version 3.12
```

#### Bazel
```bash
bazel version
```
Expected minimum:
```
Build label: 3.x
```


## 4. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Compiler Compatibility:** Older compilers might support some C++17 features but not fully. Always verify the `__cplusplus` macro reflects 201703L.

- **Environment Setup:** Be sure environment PATHs include the correct compiler and build tool versions,
especially if multiple versions are installed.

- **Platform-Specific Notes:** On Windows, ensure the MSVC toolset targets the Windows SDK with C++17 support.

- **Build Tool Choice:** Choose CMake or Bazel based on your project and build environment; both are fully supported but have different configuration styles.

- **Network Requirements:** No special network connectivity is needed for the build except for downloading dependencies if you fetch sources externally.


## 5. Next Steps

Once your environment meets these requirements:

- Proceed to [Installing with CMake](../getting-started/installation-guide/installing-cmake.md) to build GoogleMock using CMake.
- Alternatively, see [Installing with Bazel](../getting-started/installation-guide/installing-bazel.md) if using Bazel.
- After installation, refer to [Verifying Installation & Configuration](../getting-started/installation-guide/configuration-validation.md) to confirm your build works correctly.

<Tip>
Always confirm your compiler supports C++17 before attempting to build GoogleMock; improper compiler configuration is the primary cause of build failures.

</Note>

<Warning>
Do NOT skip environment verification steps; ignoring compiler and tool versions will result in cryptic build errors.
