# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Ensure your development environment meets the minimum system, compiler, and C++ language standard requirements to successfully build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page outlines critical prerequisites and supported platforms to help you avoid compatibility issues and ensure a smooth testing setup.

---

## 1. Minimum System & Compiler Requirements

To build and use GoogleTest/GoogleMock, your environment must fulfill the following:

- **C++ Language Standard**: Must support at least **C++17** (ISO standard 2017 or later).
  - GoogleTest enforces this minimum at compile time; attempting to build with an older C++ standard will fail.
- **Compiler Support**:
  - **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: version 7.0 or later is required.
  - **Clang**: version 3.4.1 or later.
  - **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later (MSVC version 19.11+).
  - **Intel LLVM Compiler**: Supported with specific tweaks.
  - **Other compilers** such as SunPro, IBM VisualAge, HP aCC have limited or conditional support — check the compatibility references.

<Note>
GoogleTest will not compile successfully on compilers that do not support C++17 or later. Confirm the C++ standard being used by your build system.
</Note>

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Toolchains

GoogleTest/GoogleMock officially supports a broad range of operating systems and toolchains, consistent with Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).

- **Linux and BSD Variants**:
  - Linux distributions with GNU toolchains.
  - FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD.
  - GNU/Hurd and GNU/kFreeBSD.
- **macOS and iOS**:
  - macOS with Clang-based toolchains.
  - iOS supported to a limited extent (some features disabled).
- **Windows**:
  - Windows Desktop app builds with MSVC.
  - MinGW is supported but with limitations (e.g., no POSIX pthread support).
  - Windows Store apps, Windows Phone, Windows RT have partial or no support.
- **Other Platforms**:
  - IBM AIX, Solaris (SunPro compiler), HP-UX, Fuchsia, Native Client, Z/OS, Haiku.
  - Embedded and special platforms (e.g., Xtensa, ESP8266) may have limited or no GoogleTest support.

<Warning>
Some advanced GoogleTest features (e.g., death tests, stream redirection) rely on platform capabilities like file system availability, threading support, or regex library presence — verify feature support on your OS.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Threading and Concurrency Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms that support `pthread` (POSIX threads). This includes Linux, macOS, BSD, and most UNIX-like systems.
- On Windows, GoogleTest uses native threading primitives.
- On MinGW, pthreads are **not** supported by GoogleTest; Windows threading primitives are used instead.
- You can check thread safety at compile time by testing the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.

<Tip>
If GoogleTest fails to detect pthread support correctly in your environment, you can manually override it by adding compiler flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable pthread
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable pthread
```

</Tip>

---

## 4. C++ Runtime and Compiler Flags

GoogleTest configures strict compiler and linker flags to ensure consistency and robustness:

- **Static vs Shared Runtime CRT (Windows)**:
  - By default, GoogleTest builds with static CRT (/MT flag), which avoids runtime DLL dependency.
  - If your application uses dynamic CRT, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake to switch GoogleTest accordingly.
- **Compiler Warnings and Exceptions**:
  - High warning levels enabled (e.g., `/W4` on MSVC, `-Wall -Wextra` on GCC/Clang).
  - Exceptions enabled unless explicitly disabled.
  - RTTI support is checked and used; can be disabled but requires care.

<Check>
Confirm that your build system honors GoogleTest recommended defaults, or follow the hints to adjust compiler flags for compatibility.
</Check>

---

## 5. File System, Regex, and Other Feature Support

GoogleTest relies on several platform features:

- **File System**: Needed for features like death tests and temporary directory management.
- **Regex Library**:
  - Uses `re2` if built with Abseil.
  - Uses POSIX regex on UNIX-like platforms.
  - Falls back on a simple regex implementation where none of the above are available.
- **Stream Redirection**: Supported on most desktop OSes to capture test output.

If your platform lacks these features, GoogleTest will disable dependent features automatically.

## 7. Where To Confirm Platform Versions and Compatibility

For the most up-to-date and detailed platform and compiler version matrix, refer to the official [Google foundational C++ support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

This provides explicit compiler versions and operating system versions tested and verified to work with GoogleTest.

---

## 8. Practical Recommendations

- **Verify Compiler Version**: Run `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or check Visual Studio version to ensure compliance.
- **Use CMake Minimum Version 3.14+**: Required for smooth integration and features like FetchContent.
- **Explicitly Support C++17**: Add `-std=c++17` or equivalent to your compiler flags.
- **On Windows, Align CRT Selection**: Use CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` if your project uses dynamic CRT.
- **Check Threading Model**: If encountering build or runtime failures related to threads, verify `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro status and adjust if needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform & Compiler Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Failures Due to Unsupported C++ Standard">
Ensure your compiler is invoked with C++17 support. For GCC and Clang, add `-std=c++17` to your compile flags.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows Related to CRT Mismatch">
Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` when building GoogleTest if your project is linked against the dynamic CRT `/MD` to avoid runtime conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Issues on MinGW">
GoogleTest disables `pthread` on MinGW and uses Windows threading instead. If tests behave unpredictably, check for inconsistent linking or multiple runtime libraries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Regular Expressions or Death Test Failures on Embedded Platforms">
Embedded platforms may lack file system or regex support required by certain GoogleTest features.
You may need to disable those features or adjust your build accordingly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
