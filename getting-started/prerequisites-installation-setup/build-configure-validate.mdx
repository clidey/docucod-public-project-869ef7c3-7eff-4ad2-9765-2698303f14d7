# Build, Configure, and Validate Your Installation

Welcome to the critical step where you set up a simple test project using GoogleTest, build it, and run a sample test. This guide ensures you have a solid foundation by validating that your GoogleTest installation is correctly configured and functioning as expected.

---

## 1. Setting Up Your Simple Test Project

Your goal is to create, configure, and compile a minimal C++ test project that uses GoogleTest. Completing this step confirms that your environment is ready for writing and running tests.

### Step 1: Create a New Test Directory

Create a dedicated directory for your test project to keep things organized.

```bash
mkdir googletest-simple-test
cd googletest-simple-test
```

### Step 2: Write a Sample Test File

Create a file named `simple_test.cc` that includes GoogleTest and defines a basic test:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test case to verify that GoogleTest works
TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);  // This will pass
  EXPECT_NE(1 + 1, 3);  // This will pass
}

// Entry point for running all tests
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Step 3: Write a Build Configuration

GoogleTest supports multiple build systems, but CMake is commonly used. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` with the following content:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(SimpleGoogleTestProject)

# Enable C++17 standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Find GoogleTest package (adjust the path if installed elsewhere)
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

# Add your test executable
add_executable(simple_test simple_test.cc)

# Link GoogleTest and pthread (on Unix systems)
target_link_libraries(simple_test GTest::gtest_main pthread)

# Optionally enable testing
include(CTest)
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME simple_test COMMAND simple_test)
```

<Tip>
If GoogleTest is not found, ensure it is installed and the CMake `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` includes the directory where GoogleTest is located, or use `add_subdirectory()` if you prefer building gtest with your project.
</Tip>

## 2. Building Your Project

Once your files are set up, build your test program.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Verification

- After building, you should have an executable named `simple_test` in the `build` directory.
- If CMake or make issues errors about missing GoogleTest, verify installation and environment setup.

## 3. Running the Sample Test

Execute the compiled test binary to confirm everything is working:

```bash
./simple_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
If the test fails or the binary cannot run, verify your compiler supports C++17 and that GoogleTest libraries are linked correctly.
</Tip>

## 4. Validating Test Setup

To be confident in your setup:

- Confirm the compiler version supports C++17 or later (check with `g++ --version`, `clang++ --version`, or Visual Studio version).
- Verify the test program runs and passes without errors.
- If using CMake, check that the find_package call locates GoogleTest correctly.
- For build or runtime errors, consult troubleshooting in the related [Troubleshooting Common Installation & Build Issues](/getting-started/first-test-debugging/troubleshooting-common-issues) page.

## 5. Summary and Next Steps

- Your test project now successfully compiles and runs a simple GoogleTest test.
- Next, explore writing your own tests by reading [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-debugging/writing-running-first-test).
- Gain insights into test discovery by going through [Understanding Test Discovery](/guides/getting-started/test-discovery-workflow).
- For mocking and more complex test behaviors, consider the guides on [Mocking Functions and Objects](/guides/core-workflows/mocking-basics) and [Setting Expectations and Behaviors](/guides/core-workflows/expectations-behaviors).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Build and Run">
<Accordion title="GoogleTest Not Found by CMake">
Ensure GoogleTest is installed on your system and accessible. You may need to set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or use `add_subdirectory()` to include GoogleTest in your build.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Check your compiler version. GoogleTest requires at least C++17. Use `g++ --version` or equivalent to verify. Upgrade if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Related to pthread">
On Unix-like systems, GoogleTest links to pthread. Confirm your linker flags include `-pthread`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
For detailed platform and compiler compatibility, consult the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation-setup/system-requirements-supported-platforms).
</Note>

## Additional Tips

- Use the flag `--gtest_break_on_failure` when running tests to stop at the first failure.
- Turn on verbose output with `--gtest_verbose=info` for deeper diagnostics.
- Consider using IDE or text editor support for GoogleTest to speed up test development.
