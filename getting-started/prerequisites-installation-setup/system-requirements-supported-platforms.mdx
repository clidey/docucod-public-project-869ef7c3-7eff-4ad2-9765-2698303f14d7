# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

This page clarifies the minimum required compiler versions, C++ standard prerequisites, and details on operating systems and platforms officially supported by GoogleTest. It helps you verify that your development environment is compatible before proceeding with installation and usage.

---

## 1. C++ Language and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest is designed to be built and run in modern C++ environments. To ensure compatibility and full functionality, observe these minimum requirements:

- **C++ Standard:**
  - GoogleTest requires **at least C++17** support. Attempts to build with earlier standards will fail.
  - You can enforce C++17 by setting your compiler flags or CMake variables accordingly (e.g., `-std=c++17` or `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`).

- **Compiler Versions:**
  - **GCC:** Version 7.0 or newer
  - **Clang:** Version 3.4.1 or newer
  - **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
  - **Intel LLVM:** Compatible with C++17

> <Tip>
> If you're using CMake to build GoogleTest, specifying `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)` in your project or the GoogleTest build is the most straightforward way to meet this requirement.
> </Tip>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms, with the most robust and well-tested support on the following:

| Platform               | Notes                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**              | Full support including common distributions   |
| **Windows**            | Desktop editions with MSVC or MinGW toolchains |
| **Mac OS X** (macOS)   | Including Xcode environments                   |
| **Cygwin**             | Supported but less common                       |

Other platforms with partial or experimental support include:

- BSD variants such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
- z/OS
- Android (Linux Android flavor)
- iOS (subset support)
- Embedded platforms: ESP8266, ESP32, NXP QN9090, NRF52
- Google Fuchsia
- GNU/Hurd

> <Note>
> Core contributors primarily test on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Cygwin. Support for other platforms may be less stable. If you encounter issues on these, consider contacting the community or contributing fixes.
> </Note>

## 3. Threading and Library Features

- GoogleTest supports multithreaded tests where the platform provides pthreads or equivalent threading primitives.
- Detection of pthread availability is automatic but can be overridden with compiler flags (`-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`).
- Some platforms (e.g., Windows Mobile or embedded) may not support thread-safe features fully.

---

## 4. Build Tool Compatibility

GoogleTest is tested primarily with:

- **CMake:** Supports wide platform range; includes scripts for many compilers.
- Other build systems are possible but may require manual configuration.

Refer to the [Installation with CMake and Bazel](../prerequisites-installation-setup/installation-cmake-bazel) page for detailed build instructions.

## 5. Summarized Requirements Checklist

| Requirement                            | Details                                       |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **C++ Standard**                     | At least C++17 support                        |
| **Compiler**                        | GCC ≥ 7.0, Clang ≥ 3.4.1, MSVC ≥ 2017 Update 3 |
| **Platforms**                      | Windows, Linux, macOS, Cygwin (primary); others less tested |
| **Threading support**               | pthreads or native threads supported on most desktop OS |
| **Build System**                   | CMake 3.14+ strongly recommended               |

## 6. Verifying Your Environment Compatibility

To confirm your setup meets these requirements:

1. **Check compiler version and C++17 support**:

   ```bash
   # GCC
   gcc --version

   # Clang
   clang --version

   # MSVC (in Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt)
   cl
   ```

2. **Verify CMake version**:

   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```

3. **Platform confirmation**:

   Review your OS information via system tools (`uname -a` on UNIX-like, or System Information in Windows).

4. **Optional: Force pthread usage**

   If your platform doesn't auto-detect pthreads correctly, add `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to your compiler flags.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls

- Attempting to build with C++ standards earlier than C++17 will fail.
- Using outdated compiler versions unsupported by GoogleTest causes cryptic build errors.
- Building on unsupported or less common platforms might require community help.
- Missing pthread libraries on some *nix variants can disable thread safety.

---

## 8. Additional Resources

- See the [Supported Platforms documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) for the latest detailed compatibility matrix.
- Refer to the [GoogleTest README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md) for comprehensive build instructions.
- For extended platform and compiler details, consult the internal headers `gtest-port.h` and `gtest-port-arch.h` within the source for macros defining platform capabilities.

This concludes the System Requirements & Supported Platforms overview. Confirming your tools and environment meet these requisites ensures a smooth setup and stable operation of GoogleTest.
