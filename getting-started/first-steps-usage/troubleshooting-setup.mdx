# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

When setting up GoogleTest and GoogleMock, encountering errors during installation, build, or test execution can interrupt your progress. This page provides practical solutions to common setup problems, guiding you swiftly to a successful configuration.

---

## 1. Common Installation and Build Errors

### Problem: Missing or Incorrect Dependencies
- **Cause:** Your environment lacks required libraries or toolchain components.
- **Solution:**
  1. Verify you have a supported C++ compiler (C++17 minimum).
  2. Confirm CMake is installed and accessible in your PATH.
  3. Ensure `pthread` (or Windows equivalent threading support) is available.
  4. Check that your build environment matches compatibility notes in the [Supported Platforms & Compatibility](/overview/introduction-getting-started/supported-platforms).

### Problem: Build Fails Due to Misconfiguration
- **Cause:** CMake or your build system is not correctly configured.
- **Solution:**
  1. Use the official [Installation Methods guide](/getting-started/preparation-installation/installation-methods) for step-by-step instructions.
  2. Set CMake variables correctly, particularly for `gmock` and `gtest` source directories.
  3. When using CMake, build with `cmake --build` or standard `make` commands.
  4. Run `cmake` in a clean build directory to avoid residual errors.

### Problem: Linking Errors, Especially on Windows
- **Cause:** Platform-specific nuances such as Unicode support or missing libraries.
- **Solution:**
  1. Follow the workaround in `gmock_main.cc` where `main()` is used instead of `_tmain()` for MSVC.
  2. Link all required libraries explicitly.
  3. Refer to build configuration notes in the [Build Configuration guide](/getting-started/preparation-installation/build-configuration).

## 2. Flag Parsing and Command-Line Issues

GoogleMock and GoogleTest parse flags from command-line arguments to modify behavior and verbosity.

### Recognizing GoogleMock Flags
- GoogleMock flags begin with `--gmock_`, such as `--gmock_verbose=info` or `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks=1`.
- Flags are automatically parsed and removed by `InitGoogleMock()`.

### Common Problems
- Flags not recognized, leading to unexpected behavior or failures.
- Conflicts with non-GoogleMock flags.

### Solutions
1. Ensure that your test program calls `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` before running tests.
2. Use the exact syntax for flags; for example, `--gmock_verbose=warning`.
3. When mixing flags, place GoogleMock flags before non-recognized flags to avoid misinterpretation.
4. On Windows, use the wide-string overload if your program compiles with Unicode: `InitGoogleMock(int* argc, wchar_t** argv);`.

<Note>
`InitGoogleMock()` removes recognized flags from `argv` to avoid polluting test argument parsing.
</Note>

## 3. Running Tests: Errors and Output

### Unable to Run Tests or Tests Not Discovered
- Check that your test binary links with `gtest_main` or defines `main()` properly.
- Confirm that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called and its return value is correctly handled.

### Tests Fail Unexpectedly With Verbose Output
- Adjust verbosity flags to diagnose issues.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to show detailed GoogleMock messages.

### Detecting Leaked Mocks
- If failures are related to leaked mocks, ensure `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks=1` is set (default behavior).
- Leaked mocks cause test failures to help identify memory management issues.

## 4. Best Practices for Smooth Setup

- Build and install from a clean, isolated directory.
- Follow [Installation Methods](/getting-started/preparation-installation/installation-methods) strictly.
- Use the provided `gmock_main.cc` or link against `gmock_main` library for proper test startup.
- Confirm your environment's compiler and platform support as detailed in [Supported Platforms & Compatibility](/overview/introduction-getting-started/supported-platforms).

## 5. Troubleshooting Quick Reference

<AccordionGroup title="Quick Troubleshooting Checklist">
<Accordion title="Build Fails with Missing pthread Threading Library">
On Linux or macOS, ensure `pthread` is installed and linked. In CMake, check `CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT` is linked correctly. On Windows, ensure threading is supported in your environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Related to main Function">
Use the `gmock_main.cc` implementation as your entry point or link against `gmock_main` library. On MSVC, avoid `_tmain()` in favor of `main()` to prevent linker errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flags Not Being Parsed / Parsed Incorrectly">
Verify `InitGoogleMock()` is called early. Confirm flags use the correct `--gmock_` prefix. Use wide-char overload on Windows if your app uses Unicode.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Are Ignored">
Confirm test discovery by ensuring `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros are used correctly. Check that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called and you check its return code.
</Accordion>
