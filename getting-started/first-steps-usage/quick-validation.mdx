# Quick Validation and Smoke Test

Confirm that GoogleTest is properly installed and operational by running simple example tests. This guide explains how to compile a provided sample, run it, and interpret the output so you can immediately verify your setup.

---

## 1. Purpose

Before proceeding to write your own tests with GoogleTest, it is crucial to validate that the GoogleTest framework is correctly installed and integrated into your build environment. This quick validation and smoke test process will:

- Verify the installation correctness.
- Demonstrate compiling a simple example test.
- Show how to run tests and interpret outputs.
- Ensure your development environment is configured and ready for test development.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting the quick validation test, ensure:

- **GoogleTest is installed** according to the instructions in the Installation guides.
- Your compiler supports the required C++ standard and tools as specified in the System Requirements.
- Your build system is configured to link with GoogleTest libraries.
- Basic knowledge of command line compilation and execution.

If you have not completed these steps, refer to:
- [System Requirements](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements)
- [Installation (All Platforms)](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-platforms)
- [Configuring GoogleTest in Your Project](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/configuration-setup)

## 3. Example Test Source Code

GoogleTest provides a minimal example source for quick validation. Below is a simple test case you can use to check your setup:

```cpp
// File: simple_test.cc
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A trivial test case.
TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This test does nothing but confirm that GoogleTest can run a basic assertion.

## 4. Compile and Build the Sample Test

Follow these steps to compile the sample test.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to your source directory">
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `simple_test.cc`.
</Step>
<Step title="Compile using your build system or command line">

If you use CMake, configure your project to include GoogleTest and build the test target. For manual compilation using `g++` or `clang++`, run:

```bash
# Adjust the include and library paths to your installation
g++ simple_test.cc -o simple_test -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread /path/to/googletest/lib/libgtest.a /path/to/googletest/lib/libgtest_main.a
```

For Bazel or other build tools, please refer to their respective configuration guides.

</Step>
<Step title="Verify successful compilation">
If compilation completes without errors, the binary `simple_test` has been created.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you encounter compilation errors, verify your include paths and library links. Confirm that the GoogleTest libraries have been correctly built.
</Tip>

## 5. Run the Smoke Test

1. Execute the test binary:

   ```bash
   ./simple_test
   ```

2. Observe the output:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This output shows the test was discovered, executed, and passed successfully.

## 6. Understanding the Output

- **Test Discovery**: GoogleTest found 1 test case (`SampleTest`) with 1 test (`BasicAssertions`).
- **Test Execution**: The test ran and passed, as indicated by `[  PASSED  ]`.
- **Timing**: The whole run completed quickly, demonstrating no overhead or hang.

If your output matches or closely resembles this, your GoogleTest setup is functional and ready for development.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="Test binary fails to run or segfaults immediately">
Check that your executable has proper permissions and your GoogleTest build matches your system architecture.

Verify no conflicting runtime libraries or ABI mismatches.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests are not discovered or zero tests run">
Make sure the test registration macro `TEST` is used correctly.

Confirm `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in your `main()`.

Also verify your test is linked against `gtest_main` or provides its own main function.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors for gtest symbols">
Ensure your linker command includes GoogleTest static or shared libraries.

Verify library paths and order in linker command line.

When using CMake, validate your `target_link_libraries` includes `gtest` and `gtest_main`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation errors about missing headers">
Confirm the include path contains `googletest/include`.

Check that you installed GoogleTest source or development package completely.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

Once your quick validation test succeeds:

- Proceed to write more detailed tests in your project code.
- Explore writing and running your first real test case: [Writing & Running Your First Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/first-steps-usage/writing-running-first-test).
- Learn about test discovery and execution workflows for automated testing.
- Familiarize yourself with mocking using GoogleMock if needed for interaction testing.
