# Quick Validation Checklist

Verifying your GoogleTest installation is a crucial step before writing and running tests. This checklist walks you through confirming that all necessary components are properly linked, initialized, and functioning as expected with a simple test run. Follow these steps to confidently validate your GoogleTest build.

---

## 1. Confirm Library Linkage

The first sign of a correct setup is successful compilation and linking of your test executable.

### Actions:
- **Link your test binary** against `gtest` or `gtest_main` to ensure the framework is included.
- If using GoogleMock, link against `gmock` or `gmock_main`.

```bash
# Example linking with gtest_main (CMake or manual build)
$(CXX) my_tests.cpp -lgtest_main -lpthread -o my_tests
```

### Expected Outcome:
- The linker resolves all GoogleTest symbols.
- No undefined reference errors related to GoogleTest.

<Check>
If you see linker errors (undefined references), check your build configuration and ensure the appropriate GoogleTest libraries are included.
</Check>

---

## 2. Verify `main()` Function Initialization

GoogleTest requires calling its initialization function before running tests.

### Actions:
- If you linked with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`, a suitable `main()` is provided for you.
- If you provide your own `main()`, ensure it follows this pattern:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Expected Outcome:
- Your test executable runs without initialization errors.
- Command-line flags for GoogleTest are properly recognized.

<Check>
Omitting `InitGoogleTest()` causes tests not to run correctly and flags to be ignored.
</Check>

---

## 3. Run the Sample or Minimal Test

Create and run a minimal test to verify that GoogleTest executes tests properly.

### Minimal Test Example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertion) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}
```

### Running the Test:
```bash
./my_tests
```

### Expected Output:
- The test framework prints something like:

```
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertion
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertion (0 ms)

[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

- Exit code `0` indicates success.

<Check>
If tests fail to run or no tests are discovered, confirm your test definitions use valid `TEST` macros and you correctly linked GoogleTest.
</Check>

---

## 4. Confirm Passing Test Output

When running tests, successful output includes detailed summaries.

### What to Look For:
- Lines containing `[  PASSED  ]` with test counts.
- Summary lines that report total tests and failures.
- Absence of error or assertion failure messages.

### Example Terminal Output:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertion
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Check>
Failure outputs or non-zero return codes indicate problems with your setup, such as linking errors or missing dependencies.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Quick Validation">
<Accordion title="Linking Errors">
- Verify you have added the GoogleTest libraries and include paths correctly in your build system.
- For CMake, ensure you use `target_link_libraries(your_target gtest_main)` or equivalent.
- On Windows, watch for runtime library conflicts between static and dynamic CRTs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Tests Found">
- Check that test macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`) use valid names without underscores.
- Make sure your test files are compiled and linked.
- Confirm tests are not filtered out by any `--gtest_filter` command-line flag.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Initialization Issues">
- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- If using GoogleMock, prefer `testing::InitGoogleMock`, which also initializes GoogleTest.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Failures or Crashes">
- Look at the test output for assertion failures.
- Use verbose logging flags like `--gtest_verbose=info` to get more diagnostics.
- Run tests individually by filtering: `--gtest_filter=SampleTest.BasicAssertion`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. What’s Next?

After passing the quick validation checklist, you're ready to:

- Write more comprehensive tests using GoogleTest’s rich assertion macros.
- Explore parameterized and typed tests for advanced testing scenarios.
- Use GoogleMock for creating and testing mock objects.

Refer to the [Writing and Running Your First Test](../create-run-test) guide for a detailed walkthrough.

---

## Additional Tips

- Link with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to avoid writing your own `main()`.
- Use the `-lgtest` and `-lpthread` flags on Unix systems.
- Always check the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` to ensure CI systems detect failures.

<Tip>
Consistency in your test naming and structure will ensure smooth discovery and execution.
</Tip>
