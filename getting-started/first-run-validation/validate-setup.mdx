# Validating Your Setup

Welcome to the final step before diving into writing your own tests with GoogleTest — validating that your installation and configuration are working as expected. This page guides you through running example tests shipped with GoogleTest, interpreting their outcomes, and troubleshooting common setup issues to ensure your environment is fully operational.

---

## 1. Purpose of Validation

After installing GoogleTest, you'll want to quickly confirm it's correctly built, installed, and ready for use. Running the included example test executables serves this purpose. It uncovers problems early—whether in your build configuration, compiler compatibility, or runtime environment—providing confidence that your setup supports your upcoming test development.


## 2. Running the Example Tests

GoogleTest offers test executables built as part of its repository. The main example we're focusing on is the `googletest-output-test_` executable, which runs a variety of validation tests designed to stress and verify GoogleTest's core functionalities.

### How to Run:

1. **Locate the Test Executable**

   After building GoogleTest (as described in the installation guides), find the test executable, usually named `googletest-output-test_`. This is often located in your build output directory.

2. **Execute the Tests**

   Run the executable from your command line:

   ```bash
   ./googletest-output-test_
   ```

3. **Observe the Output**

   The program will run 90 tests from 43 test suites. Various test results including pass, fail, and skipped are reported with detailed messages.

### Typical Output Example

```plaintext
[==========] Running 90 tests from 43 test suites.
[  PASSED  ] 31 tests.
[  SKIPPED ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 57 tests.
1 FAILED TEST SUITE
```

Failures indicate your test suite catches issues as intended. One specific suite, `TestSuiteThatFailsToSetUp`, intentionally fails during `SetUpTestSuite` and/or `TearDownTestSuite` to verify error detection.


## 3. Understanding Failure Reports

GoogleTest displays detailed messages for failed tests, including:

- **Failure Location:** File and line number in the test code.
- **Actual vs Expected:** Values that did not meet expectations.
- **Stack Trace:** The call stack at the failure point.

These messages are invaluable for diagnosing problems.

### Example Failure Message

```plaintext
gtest.cc:#: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  1
  x
    Which is: 2
Stack trace: (omitted)
```

This means a test expected `1` but got `2` instead.


## 4. Key Tests to Note

- **SetupFailTest & TearDownFailTest:** These test fixtures intentionally cause failures in `SetUpTestSuite()` or `TearDownTestSuite()`. If these failures are reported, it confirms GoogleTest correctly detects and reports errors during test suite setup and teardown.

- **PassingTest:** Confirms successful tests run and report correctly.

- **NonfatalFailureTest and FatalFailureTest:** Validate handling of non-fatal and fatal assertion failures.

- **MixedUpTestSuiteTest:** Detects if test suite setup is inconsistent (e.g., mixing `TEST_F` and `TEST` within the same suite), ensuring test suite hygiene.


## 5. Interpreting Exit Status

The test executable returns a non-zero exit code if any test fails. This is important for integration with build systems and continuous integration pipelines, as it signals build health.


## 6. Troubleshooting

If your tests do not run or the executable is missing:

- Verify that you have successfully built GoogleTest according to the [Build and Install from Source](https://google.github.io/googletest/installation-config/build-from-source) guide.
- Confirm your compiler supports at least C++17 as required.
- Check environment variables and path settings to ensure the executable is locatable.

If the test executable runs but reports unexpected failures:

- Examine failure messages carefully for clues about your environment or build.
- Confirm no mixing of incompatible test fixtures or mismatched class definitions in your test sources.
- Review the [FAQ & Common Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/troubleshooting-help/faq-common-issues) section for solutions.


## 7. Next Steps

After successfully validating your setup, you can proceed to:

- Writing your first test case using the [Primer and Hello Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/first-run-validation/primer-quickstart) guide.
- Familiarizing yourself with [Test Fixtures and Assertions](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/getting-started/core-assertions-best-practices) for more effective tests.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions">
<Accordion title="What does it mean if the setup test reports failures?">
A failure in setup tests usually indicates misconfiguration or build issues with GoogleTest. Review failure messages carefully to identify the problem.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I find the test executables?">
They are typically located in your build output directory after compiling GoogleTest. Use your build system's documentation for exact paths.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some tests intentionally fail?">
Some tests are designed to verify GoogleTest's error detection capabilities. Their failure confirms that GoogleTest correctly captures and reports errors during setup or assertion execution.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
Always check the exit code of your test runs in automated environments to detect failures early.

<Note>
Use the test executable with relevant GoogleTest flags (e.g., `--gtest_filter`) to isolate and understand specific test behaviors.
