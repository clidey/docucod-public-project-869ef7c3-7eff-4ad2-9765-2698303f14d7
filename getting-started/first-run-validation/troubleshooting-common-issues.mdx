# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide powerful C++ testing and mocking frameworks that enable you to develop robust tests efficiently. However, during installation and initial configuration, it's common to encounter challenges ranging from compiler incompatibilities to build configuration errors. This guide identifies the most frequent problems users face and provides definitive, actionable solutions to get you up and running swiftly.

## 1. Compiler Compatibility Issues

### Problem
Your code fails to compile or mock methods invoke the real implementation unexpectedly.

### Causes & Solutions
- **Compiler Does Not Fully Support C++11 or Newer:**
  GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a compiler with adequate C++11 support for features like `override`, lambdas, and smart pointers.

  **Action:**
  - Use GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.3+, MSVC 2015+, or later.
  - Check your compiler version:
    ```bash
    g++ --version
    clang++ --version
    cl
    ```
  - Upgrade your compiler if it’s too old.

- **Non-Virtual Methods Mocked Unexpectedly Run Original Code:**
  Only virtual methods can be mocked. If your mock class's methods are not declared `virtual`, the real implementation will run instead.

  **Action:**
  - Make sure the base class methods you want to mock are declared `virtual` and have `virtual` destructors.
  - Verify your mock class properly overrides these methods using `MOCK_METHOD` with the `override` specifier.

  ```cpp
  class Turtle {
   public:
    virtual ~Turtle() {}
    virtual void PenUp() = 0;
    ...
  };

  class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
   public:
    MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
    ...
  };
  ```

- **Constness and Calling Conventions:**
  MSVC may warn if parameter const qualifiers on mock methods differ.

  **Action:**
  - Ensure method signatures in mocks exactly match overridden methods.
  - Remove unnecessary top-level `const` from parameters.
  - Use explicit calling convention specifiers if needed (`Calltype`).


## 2. Build System and Configuration Errors

### Problem
Errors during CMake or Bazel build configuration or linking phases.

### Causes & Solutions
- **Missing gMock and gTest Dependencies:**
  Ensure your build system includes both GoogleTest and GoogleMock targets.

  **Action:**
  - When using CMake, use `FetchContent` or add subdirectories properly:
    ```cmake
    add_subdirectory(googletest)
    # Link against gmock and gtest
    target_link_libraries(your_test PRIVATE gmock gtest)
    ```
  - For Bazel, declare dependencies correctly.

- **Incorrect Include Paths or Header References:**
  Compilation may fail if headers like `<gmock/gmock.h>` or `<gtest/gtest.h>` are not found.

  **Action:**
  - Verify include paths in your build system.
  - Ensure `include_directories()` or equivalent include GoogleTest and GoogleMock sources.

- **Linker Errors for Magic Symbols:**
  Missing symbols like `InitGoogleMock` indicate linking missing initialization.

  **Action:**
  - Link against `gmock_main` instead of just `gmock` for test binaries that initialize automatically.
  - Alternatively, call `::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` explicitly in `main()`.


## 3. Runtime Issues and Unexpected Behavior

### Problem
Mock objects fail to verify expectations or behave unexpectedly at runtime.

### Causes & Solutions
- **Setting Expectations After Calls:**
  GoogleMock expects `EXPECT_CALL` before any invocation of the mocked method.

  **Action:**
  - Always define your `EXPECT_CALL`s before exercising your mock objects.

- **Mock Object Lifetime and Verification:**
  If mock objects are never destroyed, GoogleMock will not verify expectations.

  **Action:**
  - Delete or allow mocks to go out of scope so destructors run.
  - Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);` to verify early.

- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:**
  Calls made to mock methods without `EXPECT_CALL` specifications print warnings.

  **Action:**
  - Use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior when calls are allowed but not tested.
  - Consider wrapping mocks in `NiceMock` to suppress warnings.

- **Unexpected Call Failures:**
  When calls to mocks do not match any `EXPECT_CALL`, test failures occur.

  **Action:**
  - Check argument matchers and call counts in `EXPECT_CALL`s.
  - Use catch-all expectations like `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` if other calls are valid but not under test.


## 4. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Non-Virtual or Missing Virtual Destructors:**
  Leads to unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

- **Confusing Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls:**
  Understand that uninteresting calls simply warn by default, while unexpected calls fail the test.

- **Sticky Expectations:**
  Expectations persist after saturation unless retired explicitly via `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.

- **Over-Specifying Expectations:**
  Avoid setting too many strict expectations that make your tests brittle.


## 5. Step-by-Step Quick Recovery Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Compiler Support">
Check that your compiler supports at least C++11. Upgrade if necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Build System Includes gMock and gTest">
Make sure your build configuration includes and links the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Headers Are Accessible">
Verify include paths include directories with `gtest` and `gmock` headers.
</Step>
<Step title="Proper Mock Method Declaration">
Ensure methods to be mocked are virtual in the base class and declared with `MOCK_METHOD` with `override` in the mock.
</Step>
<Step title="Set Expectations Before Calls">
Always specify `EXPECT_CALL`s before calling mock methods.
</Step>
<Step title="Handle Uninteresting Calls">
Add `ON_CALL` for expected-but-untested methods or use `NiceMock` to quiet warnings.
</Step>
<Step title="Link With gmock_main or Initialize GoogleMock Explicitly">
Link your test binary with `gmock_main` or call `InitGoogleMock` in `main()`.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
If problems persist, increase verbosity of Google Mock to get detailed logs:
Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock invocation traces.
</Check>
