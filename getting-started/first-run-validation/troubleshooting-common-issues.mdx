# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide is your go-to reference for identifying and resolving frequent installation and configuration problems encountered during early setups of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It provides targeted advice on compilation errors, missing dependencies, runtime failures, and unexpected behaviors you might face while running your first tests.

---

## 1. Compilation Errors

When building your test suite or the GoogleTest framework, compilation issues are often caused by missing dependencies, incorrect compiler versions, or misconfigurations.

### Common Causes & Solutions

- **Missing `gmock` or `gtest` Headers**
  - Verify that your include paths correctly reference the GoogleTest and GoogleMock directories.
  - If using CMake, confirm you linked against `gmock` or `gtest` targets properly.

- **Unsupported Compiler Versions**
  - Ensure you use a compiler meeting the minimum version and C++ standard requirements.
  - GoogleTest requires at least C++11 support for recent versions. Check [Prerequisites and System Requirements](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/essentials/prerequisites-requirements) for details.

- **Incorrect Macro Usage in Mock Definitions**
  - `MOCK_METHOD` macro expects method signatures split correctly with careful handling of commas in template arguments.
  - Wrap complex return types or argument types containing commas with parentheses or use type aliases. See the [Defining Mock Methods and Classes](https://google.github.io/googletest/api/gmock_reference.html#mock-method) documentation.

<Accordion title="Example: Handling Commas in MOCK_METHOD">  
```cpp
class MyMock {
 public:
   // Wrap with parentheses to protect commas
   MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());

   // Or use type alias
   using BoolIntPair = std::pair<bool,int>;
   MOCK_METHOD(BoolIntPair, GetPair, ());
};
```
</Accordion>

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Use verbose build output to isolate header or linker errors.
- Confirm you are including `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your mock implementation files.
- Make sure all source files using mocks compile with the same C++ standard flag.

---

## 2. Linking Errors

Common linking problems include unresolved symbols, duplicate definitions, or missing libraries.

### Best Practices

- Link explicitly against both `gmock` and `gtest` libraries.
- If using `gmock_main` or `gtest_main`, only link one main function.
- Avoid defining main() in multiple files.

### Using CMake Example

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)  # Finds gtest and gmock
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cc my_mocked_code.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gmock_main GTest::gtest_main)
```

---

## 3. Runtime Failures on First Tests

After successful compilation and linking, you may encounter runtime failures or warnings while running your first test executable.

### Common Issues

- ** "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings**
  - This means a mock method was called without an `EXPECT_CALL` expectation.
  - Solution: add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, MethodName(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` if the call is expected but not important to verify.
  - Alternatively, use `NiceMock<YourMock>` to suppress these warnings globally.

- **Unexpected calls failing the test**
  - Indicates a mock method was called with arguments not matching any `EXPECT_CALL`.
  - Validate your expectations match the actual usage or add a catch-all expectation using `_` matcher.

- **Default actions not returning expected values**
  - By default, GoogleMock uses built-in default return values or default-constructed types.
  - To customize, use `ON_CALL(mock, Method(...)).WillByDefault(Return(value));`

<AccordionGroup title="Resolving Runtime Failures">  
<Accordion title="Suppressing 'Uninteresting mock function call' Warnings">
If you want to ignore calls to mock methods without explicit expectations, wrap your mock with `NiceMock`:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockMyClass> nice_mock;
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Handling Unexpected Calls">
Add a catch-all expectation to allow any call matching any argument:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Defining Default Behavior">
Use `ON_CALL` to specify default return behaviors:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Debugging Tips

- Run your tests with the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed call and expectation matching logs.
- Inspect the exact function calls and argument mismatches to adjust your `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- Review stack traces accompanying warnings for context.

---

## 4. Installation Environment & Configuration Issues

Inconsistent environment or misconfigured project setups are frequent root causes for many problems during onboarding.

### Verify That:

- Your compiler supports required C++ standards (C++11 minimum recommended).
- GoogleMock and GoogleTest versions are compatible.
- Environment variables or include paths do not point to stale or multiple conflicting copies.
- Network firewall or permissions do not block source or dependencies downloads when using package managers.

---

## 5. Verification and Cleanup Failures

Sometimes, tests may leak mocks or fail verification unexpectedly.

### Ensure:

- Mocks are properly destroyed so that GoogleMock can verify expectations.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_instance);` to silence leak checking if intentional.
- Call `::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);` in cases where destruction is delayed.
- Do not set new expectations on mock instances after they are exercised or verified.

---

## 6. When All Else Fails

If you get stuck:

- Consult the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/gmock_faq.html) for known issues.
- Browse [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for practical advice.
- Enable verbose logging and inspect output.
- Ask for help on GoogleTest issue trackers or developer forums, providing minimum reproducible examples.

---

## Appendix: Useful Diagnostic Flags

- **`--gmock_verbose=LEVEL`** controls the verbosity of GoogleMock messages.
  - `info` – shows all logs including matched expectations and call stacks (best for debugging).
  - `warning` – shows warnings and errors (default).
  - `error` – shows errors only.

- **`--gtest_stack_trace_depth=N`** controls how many stack frames to show in failures. 0 hides stacks.

Example run command:

```bash
./my_tests --gmock_verbose=info --gtest_stack_trace_depth=10
```

---

## Summary

Troubleshooting setup issues is a critical step in adopting GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. Focus on:

- Checking compiler and environment prerequisites
- Correct mock declarations and usage of `MOCK_METHOD`
- Proper linking with GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries
- Handling runtime warnings with `NiceMock` and explicit expectations
- Using diagnostic flags and verbose logging to pinpoint causes

<Check>
Be sure to set expectations on mock objects *before* exercising them.
Use `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting call warnings if calls are expected but irrelevant.
Double-check the build and link flags to avoid compilation and linking errors.
Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed diagnostic logs.
