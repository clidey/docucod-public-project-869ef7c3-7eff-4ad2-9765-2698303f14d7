# Quick Validation & Next Steps

This page serves as your essential checklist to confirm that GoogleTest and GoogleMock have been successfully installed and set up in your environment. It further guides you to key resources and next actions to deepen your understanding and effectively use the frameworks for C++ testing and mocking.

---

## 1. Validate Your Installation

### 1.1 Verify GoogleTest and GoogleMock Are Installed
- Confirm that the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries have been built and integrated into your project according to your platform-specific installation method (see [Installation: Platform-Specific Instructions](/getting-started/overview-setup/installation-platforms)).
- Ensure your build system links correctly against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.

### 1.2 Run Sample Tests
- Compile and run a minimal test binary containing at least one basic GoogleTest test case, such as:
  ```cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>

  TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
    EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
  }
  ```
- Run the test executable and confirm it passes successfully, printing output similar to:
  ```
  [==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
  [----------] Global test environment set-up.
  [----------] 1 test from HelloTest
  [ RUN      ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions
  [       OK ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
  [----------] 1 test from HelloTest (0 ms total)

  [==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
  [  PASSED  ] 1 test.
  ```

### 1.3 Test a Simple Mock
- Define a mock class for a simple interface and set expectations:
  ```cpp
  #include <gmock/gmock.h>

  class MockFoo {
   public:
    MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), ());
  };

  TEST(MockTest, ExpectCall) {
    MockFoo mock;
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));
    EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(), 42);
  }
  ```
- Compile and run to verify that mock expectations are enforced.

### 1.4 Confirm Mock Behavior Modes
- Test and verify behavior using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` wrappers to control how uninteresting calls are handled.

## 2. Key References for Further Reading

### 2.1 Understanding Core Concepts
- Explore [gMock for Dummies](docs/gmock_for_dummies.md) to grasp fundamental mock object concepts.
- Review [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/core_concepts_and_features/concepts_and_terminology) for a deeper understanding of GoogleTest structures.

### 2.2 Mocking Fundamentals & Best Practices
- Consult the [Mocking Reference](docs/reference/mocking.md) for detailed information on macros and usage.
- Browse the [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for practical recipes and examples.
- Use the [gMock Cheat Sheet](docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md) for a quick overview of mocking syntax.

### 2.3 Writing and Running Tests
- Follow [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/first-run-validation/writing-first-test) for a guided walkthrough.
- Visit [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you encounter problems.

### 2.4 Advanced Topics
- Explore guides on [Using Mocks to Isolate Dependencies](/guides/mocking-and-advanced-patterns/using-mocks).
- Learn about [Custom Actions and Matchers](/guides/mocking-and-advanced-patterns/working-with-actions-matchers).

## 3. Next Logical Steps

### 3.1 Write Your First Tests
- Start writing minimal functional and mock tests, incrementally increasing complexity as you become comfortable.
- Leverage example code in the documentation to scaffold your own test suites.

### 3.2 Configure Build System Integration
- Ensure your build system (CMake, Bazel, or others) is correctly configured to include GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

### 3.3 Explore Assertion and Matcher Capabilities
- Master GoogleTest assertions by visiting [Mastering Assertions](/guides/core-workflows/writing-assertions).
- Use built-in and custom matchers to express precise expectations.

### 3.4 Utilize Mocking for Interaction Testing
- Use mocks to isolate dependencies and behavior in unit tests.
- Define expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` and default behaviors with `ON_CALL`.

### 3.5 Troubleshoot and Optimize
- Use verbosity flags (e.g., `--gmock_verbose=info`) to gain insight into mock invocation.
- Consult troubleshooting guides if verification errors or warnings occur.

## 4. Troubleshooting Tips

- If you see warnings about "Uninteresting mock function call", either add explicit expectations or consider using `NiceMock`.
- Ensure all mocked methods are `virtual` in the base class.
- Confirm that mock objects are destroyed properly to trigger verification.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mockObj)` to explicitly check expectations if needed.

## 5. Success Indicators

- Test binaries compiled without errors.
- Simple tests pass as expected.
- Mocks behave according to their expectations.
- No warnings or failures about uninteresting or unexpected calls.

By following this checklist, you ensure that your environment is ready for productive development and testing with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Proceed to write your first tests and gradually explore the framework's rich feature set.

### Getting Help

If you get stuck, consult community forums and official GoogleTest support channels. Use verbose flags in test runs for detailed diagnostics:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This will log detailed information about mock interactions to help you understand failures.
