# Primer and Hello Test

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with GoogleTest! This guide will take you through a practical walkthrough of writing and running your initial test using GoogleTest’s simple, yet powerful framework. You'll see how quickly you can get a minimal working test and understand the basic project structure you’ll use going forward.

---

## 1. Understanding the Basics: What Is a Test?

A test in GoogleTest is a C++ function that verifies the behavior of your code. Tests are grouped into **test suites**—formerly called test cases—to organize and manage related functionality.

The core idea:

- Write tests as functions that contain assertions.
- Assertions check conditions your code must satisfy.
- GoogleTest runs these tests and reports successes or failures.


## 2. Minimal Working Test Example

Let's begin by writing the simplest test you can have in GoogleTest.

Create a source file named `sample_test.cc` (or any suitable name):

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Our first test case.
TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Expect equality.
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  // Expect inequality.
  EXPECT_NE(1, 2);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` defines a test function.
- Inside, `EXPECT_EQ` asserts two values are equal.
- `EXPECT_NE` asserts two values are not equal.

This test will always pass because the assertions are true.


## 3. Setting Up Your Project Structure

When starting out, your project typically looks like:

```
/my_project
  ├── sample_test.cc       # Your test files
  ├── CMakeLists.txt       # Build configuration (if using CMake)
  ├── src/                 # Source files of your product code
  └── include/             # Header files
```

As you proceed, you'll add more tests in separate files or directories.


## 4. Building Your First Test

GoogleTest integrates well with various build systems. The most common is CMake.

Here’s a concise CMake snippet for your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyTestProject LANGUAGES CXX)

# Find GoogleTest package
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

# Add test executable
add_executable(sample_test sample_test.cc)

target_link_libraries(sample_test PRIVATE GTest::gtest_main)

# Enable testing
include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(sample_test)
```

Build and run commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./sample_test
```

Expected output snippet:

```text
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[ RUN      ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```


## 5. Writing More Meaningful Assertions

GoogleTest provides many assertions to check your code. Here are some common ones:

| Assertion      | Purpose                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_TRUE(cond)` | Checks if condition is true                    |
| `EXPECT_FALSE(cond)`| Checks if condition is false                   |
| `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`| Checks equality (val1 == val2)                |
| `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`| Checks inequality (val1 != val2)              |
| `EXPECT_LT(val1, val2)`| Checks less than (val1 < val2)                |
| `EXPECT_LE(val1, val2)`| Checks less or equal (val1 <= val2)           |
| `EXPECT_GT(val1, val2)`| Checks greater than (val1 > val2)             |
| `EXPECT_GE(val1, val2)`| Checks greater or equal (val1 >= val2)        |

You can also write assertions inside helper functions and logically group your tests.


## 6. Sample: Testing a Simple Function

Imagine we want to test this simple function:

```cpp
int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Here’s a test for it:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int Add(int a, int b);

TEST(MathTest, AddWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(-1, -1), -2);
  EXPECT_NE(Add(10, 10), 25);
}
```

Keep tests small and focused on one behavior. This test verifies the basic addition correctness.


## 7. Running Multiple Tests and Organizing Test Suites

Create multiple `TEST()` blocks for different features or functions. GoogleTest will run them all.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, AddWorks) { /* ... */ }
TEST(MathTest, SubtractWorks) { /* ... */ }
TEST(StringTest, Concatenate) { /* ... */ }
```

Run your test executable and see a summary of all tests.


## 8. Next Steps

After you’ve written your first test, explore these topics to level up:

- **Test Fixtures:** Share setup and teardown code among tests.
- **Parameterized Tests:** Run tests with multiple inputs automatically.
- **Assertions & Matchers:** Learn advanced assertions and argument matchers.
- **GoogleMock:** If your code uses interfaces, learn how to mock dependencies.

Refer to the following docs for deeper learning:

- [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md)
- [Mocking for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md)
- [GoogleTest Core Assertions & Best Practices](core-assertions-best-practices.md)


## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your test executable:

- Does not compile: Verify you include `<gtest/gtest.h>`, link with `gtest_main`, and have a proper build setup.
- Does not run tests: Make sure you invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in the main function or use `gtest_main` to provide one.
- Tests fail unexpectedly: Check your assertions and test dependencies.

**Tip:** Use verbose flags or debugging features in GoogleTest to gain more insight.
