# Validating Your Setup

Quick steps to confirm GoogleTest is working by running built-in sample tests and interpreting test runner output. Detects and addresses common mistakes before deeper development.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Validation

Before diving into writing your tests or mocks, it is crucial to ensure that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation works correctly. This page guides you through running the built-in sample tests included with GoogleTest and interpreting their output. By validating your setup early, you avoid wasted effort debugging configuration issues later.


## 2. Run Built-In Sample Tests

GoogleTest comes with a collection of sample and self-tests designed to verify core functionality. Running these tests will check your integration and installation integrity.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Build or locate the test binary">

- If you built GoogleTest from source, find the test executable, commonly named something like `gtest_test` or `gmock_test`.
- In a CMake build, it may be under your `build` directory.
- For manual or Bazel builds, refer to your build output location.

</Step>
<Step title="Run all tests">

- Execute the test binary from a terminal or command prompt:

```bash
./gtest_test
```

or

```bash
./gmock_test
```

- This will run all enclosed sample tests, exercising critical GoogleTest and GoogleMock functionality.

</Step>
<Step title="Observe output">

- Successful runs will print each test name with a status of `[       OK ]` followed by a summary like:

```text
[  PASSED  ] 123 tests.
```

- Failure or build issues show up as assertion failures or crash messages.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If your test binary fails to run or does not exist, review the installation and build steps in the [Installation with CMake](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake) or [Installation with Bazel](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-bazel) guides.
</Tip>


## 3. Understand Test Runner Output

The test outputs serve both as confirmation and diagnostic signals.

- **Passed tests** display `[       OK ]`. Seeing many of these confirms basic framework functions correctly.
- **Failed tests** show detailed error messages with file name, line number, and failure reason.
- Common failure messages include mismatched expectations or incorrect mock calls.

### Sample Output Explanation

```text
[ RUN      ] GMockOutputTest.ExpectedCall
[       OK ] GMockOutputTest.ExpectedCall (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] GMockOutputTest.UnexpectedCall
.../gmock_output_test_.cc:75: Failure
Expected: foo_.Bar2(0, _)
  Actual: called 1 time,
 which is unexpected and will be reported only once
[  FAILED  ] GMockOutputTest.UnexpectedCall (1 ms)
```

- Above, the first test passed.
- The second failed due to an unexpected mock call, hinting at possible usage errors in your tests.


## 4. Common Mistakes and How This Validation Helps

- **Missing `InitGoogleTest` or `InitGoogleMock`:** Tests fail to run or no tests are discovered.
- **Incorrect linkage:** Symbols unresolved or linking errors during build.
- **Conflicting flags or environment:** Errors caused by incompatible command line flags.

This validation catches such issues early by exercising Google's own tests.


## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Test Runs">
<Accordion title="Test binary missing or fails to launch">

- Ensure you ran the build step successfully.
- Confirm you are in the correct directory where the executable resides.
- Verify file permissions allow execution.
- On Windows, verify `.exe` extension and PATH settings.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests fail with linking or runtime errors">

- Check that you are linking all required GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Confirm consistent compiler and standard library versions.
- Inspect for multiple conflicting versions installed.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests run but report failures or unexpected calls">

- Read failure messages carefully to identify missing expectations or mock misuses.
- Check that expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) are set before invoking mocks.
- Use the logging verbosity flag `--gmock_verbose=info` or `warning` for more output.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Enabling verbose logging during test runs helps identify subtle issues. You can pass arguments to the test executable like:

```bash
./gmock_test --gmock_verbose=info
```

This produces detailed informational messages from mock operations.
</Tip>


## 6. Next Steps After Successful Validation

- Proceed to [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/configuration-first-test/writing-first-test) to create tests in your own project.
- Configure your environment as described in [Basic Configuration & Project Setup](/getting-started/configuration-first-test/basic-configuration).
- Explore mocking features in the [GoogleMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) and [gMock For Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html).

## Summary

Validating your GoogleTest setup by running its built-in sample tests confirms your environment is configured correctly, preventing common setup pitfalls early. Carefully observing test runner output will help you detect problems before writing your own tests or mocks.

# Example: Running the GMock Output Test

To illustrate, here is a minimal command line session running the `gmock_test` with verbose logging enabled, showing a sample of the output:

```bash
$ ./gmock_test --gmock_verbose=info
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 25 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 25 tests from GMockOutputTest
[ RUN      ] GMockOutputTest.ExpectedCall
[       OK ] GMockOutputTest.ExpectedCall (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] GMockOutputTest.UnexpectedCall
.../gmock_output_test_.cc:75: Failure
Expected: foo_.Bar2(0, _)
  Actual: called 1 time,
 which is unexpected and will be reported only once
[  FAILED  ] GMockOutputTest.UnexpectedCall (1 ms)
...
[----------] 25 tests from GMockOutputTest (23 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 25 tests from 1 test suite ran. (23 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 24 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] GMockOutputTest.UnexpectedCall

 1 FAILED TEST
```

This shows the basic usage and what to look for in the output.

# How GoogleTest Validates Output

GoogleTest and GoogleMock output messages serve to:

- Confirm expected calls and warn of unexpected or excessive calls.
- Notify you of unmet expectations or incorrect argument matches.
- Report uninteresting calls with warnings so you can decide if expectations need setting.

This immediate feedback reduces guesswork during test development.

---

# Final Tips

- Always run `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()` function or link with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to get a working test runner.
- Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` or `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv)` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Use command line flags like `--gtest_filter=TestSuite.TestName` to run specific tests after validation.
