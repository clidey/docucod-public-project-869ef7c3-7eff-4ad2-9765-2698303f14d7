# Writing and Running Your First Test

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with GoogleTest! This guide walks you through creating a simple test case, building your project, executing the test binary, and understanding what a successful or failed test output looks like. By the end, you’ll know how to validate your setup and confidently write and run tests.

---

## 1. Preparing Your Test Environment

Before writing your first test, ensure your project is configured correctly to use GoogleTest. This means:

- Including GoogleTest headers and linking against its libraries.
- Using an appropriate build system integration (e.g., CMake or Bazel).
- Setting the C++ standard to at least C++11 (preferably C++17 or newer).

If you haven't configured your project yet, see our [Configuring Your Project for GoogleTest](/getting-started/configuration-first-test/project-setup) guide.

---

## 2. Writing Your First Test Case

A test case is the simplest building block of a test suite. It demonstrates how to:

1. Define a test.
2. Write assertions to check the expected behavior.

Here’s an example of a minimal test:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Tests that 1 + 1 equals 2.
TEST(ExampleTest, SimpleAddition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}
```

### Explanation:

- `TEST` defines a test named `SimpleAddition` inside the test suite called `ExampleTest`.
- `EXPECT_EQ` asserts that the two expressions are equal.

You can create as many test cases and test suites as you like in your test files.

---

## 3. Building Your Test Program

Depending on your build system, compile your tests with the appropriate commands. For example, using `CMake`:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Make sure your test executable is linked against GoogleTest libraries. The build output should produce a binary (e.g., `runTests`).

If you encounter issues, verify your build flags and linked dependencies match the [Installation and Project Setup](getting-started/configuration-first-test/project-setup) recommendations.

---

## 4. Running Your Tests

Run your test binary from the command line:

```bash
./runTests
```

GoogleTest will discover and execute all tests automatically.

### Sample Output of a Passing Test:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from ExampleTest
[ RUN      ] ExampleTest.SimpleAddition
[       OK ] ExampleTest.SimpleAddition (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from ExampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

### Sample Output of a Failing Test:

If your expectation fails (for example, if you change `EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 3);`), the output will look like:

```
[ RUN      ] ExampleTest.SimpleAddition
/path/to/test_file.cc:5: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  1 + 1
    Which is: 2
  3
[  FAILED  ] ExampleTest.SimpleAddition (0 ms)
```

This output includes the file path, line number, and a description of the mismatch.

## 5. Validating Your Setup

If you see the `(0 ms)` and `[  PASSED  ]` messages at the end of the test run, congratulations — your GoogleTest environment is ready!

Otherwise, common issues include:

- **Linking errors**: Ensure GoogleTest libraries are properly linked.
- **Header not found**: Verify include paths are set correctly.
- **Runtime failures**: Check your test code for correctness.

For detailed troubleshooting, please refer to the [Troubleshooting Installation and Configuration](/getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/common-setup-issues) and [Validating Your GoogleTest Setup](/getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/quick-validation) guides.

## 6. What Next?

- Explore writing more complex tests with fixtures.
- Add parameterized tests to expand coverage.
- Use mocks to simulate dependencies - see [Using Mocks and Expectations](/guides/effective-testing-techniques/mocking-workflows).
- Organize and group your tests for better maintainability.

To deepen your testing skills, proceed to:

- [Organizing and Grouping Tests](/guides/getting-started/test-structure)
- [Using Mocks and Expectations](/guides/effective-testing-techniques/mocking-workflows)

Happy testing!

<Tip>
Always write your `EXPECT_CALL` or setup expectations **before** calling the mock functions in your test. GoogleTest expects you to specify expectations upfront for accurate verification.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleTest automatically verifies all expectations at the end of test execution or when mock objects are destroyed. Explicit verification can be performed using `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object)` if needed.
