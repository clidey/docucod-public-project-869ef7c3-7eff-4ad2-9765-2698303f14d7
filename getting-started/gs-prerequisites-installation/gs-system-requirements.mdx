# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

This page outlines the minimum system requirements, supported compilers, platforms, and build tools needed to successfully build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Meeting these baseline requirements ensures compatibility with C++17 standards and provides a reliable foundation for your testing environment.

---

## 1. Minimum Compiler Versions and C++ Standard Support

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a development environment that supports C++17 or later. This ensures access to modern language features leveraged by the frameworks.

| Compiler           | Minimum Version Required | Notes                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| GCC                | 7.0                      | Full C++17 support recommended    |
| Clang              | 5.0                      | Ensure libc++ or libstdc++ is C++17-capable |
| Microsoft Visual C++| Visual Studio 2017 (VS 15.3) or later | Full C++17 support from VS 2017 update 3 |

> **Tip:** Use the compiler's `--version` or equivalent command to confirm version compatibility.

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to work across major desktop and server platforms. The following operating systems are officially supported:

- Linux distributions with modern GNU libc and compilers (Ubuntu 18.04+, Fedora 29+, CentOS 7+)
- Windows 10 (x64) and Windows Server 2016 and later
- macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later

> **Note:** Other POSIX-compatible systems may work but are not officially tested.

## 3. Build Tools and Environment

To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock from source, you must have the following build tools installed:

- **CMake 3.14 or later**: Used to configure and generate your project's build system files.
- **Make / Ninja / MSBuild**: The underlying build system invoked by CMake.
- **Git**: Required if fetching the source code directly from the repository or using submodules.

> **Best Practice:** Use the latest stable release of your build tools to avoid compatibility issues.

## 4. Additional Requirements for Multi-threaded Tests

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms that provide the pthread library:

- On Linux and macOS, pthread support is generally available by default.
- On Windows, thread safety is limited; tests invoking concurrent assertions should be designed carefully.

If pthread detection fails, you can override the behavior by setting the compile flag:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # to enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # to disable
```

## 5. Special Platform Notes

- **Embedded Platforms:** Some embedded targets (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52) require using the provided embedded-specific initialization functions.
- **Shared Libraries / DLLs:** To build GoogleTest as a shared library, use the compiler flag `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and link your tests appropriately with `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.
- **Visual Studio Runtime Libraries:** When building on Windows with Visual Studio, you may need to synchronize runtime library settings between your project and GoogleTest to prevent linker errors (`gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option).

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding with building GoogleTest/GoogleMock, verify your system meets the requirements:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Compiler Version">
Run your compiler's version command:

```bash
gcc --version
clang --version
cl.exe  # Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
```

Ensure the output reports at least the required minimum version.
</Step>
<Step title="Check CMake Version">
Verify you have CMake 3.14 or newer:

```bash
cmake --version
```

Update if necessary from https://cmake.org/
</Step>
<Step title="Validate pthread Availability (Linux/macOS)" >
Run:

```bash
ldconfig -p | grep pthread
```

Or verify header availability:

```bash
echo '#include <pthread.h>' | gcc -E -
```

</Step>
<Step title="Check Operating System Version">
Confirm your OS version and ensure it is supported:

- Linux: `lsb_release -a` or `cat /etc/os-release`
- Windows: `winver` via Start menu
- macOS: `sw_vers`
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors Related to C++17">
If you encounter errors about unsupported language features, ensure your compiler version is correct and that your project is set to use C++17 or higher:

- For CMake, add to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- On the command line, add appropriate flags:

```bash
-std=c++17
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows (Runtime Mismatches)">
These errors often arise due to mismatched runtime libraries between GoogleTest and your project.

- Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` when building GoogleTest.
- Ensure your project and GoogleTest target the same runtime (e.g., Multi-threaded DLL).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread Library on Linux/macOS">
If pthread is not detected or missing:

- Install development packages (`libpthread-stubs0-dev` or equivalent).
- For cross-compilation or custom toolchains, explicitly enable pthread:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported or Older OS Versions">
If your platform is not officially supported, you can attempt to build and run GoogleTest, but be aware of potential instability and missing features.

Consider upgrading your OS or using a supported virtualized environment.
