# Verifying Your Installation

Ensure your GoogleTest installation is properly configured and functional by running sample test programs or your own test files. This guide walks you through confirming the framework readiness with minimal sample code, testing execution commands, and interpreting expected outputs.

---

## 1. Purpose of Verification

After installing and setting up GoogleTest, the crucial next step is to **verify that it works as expected**. This safeguards that your environment supports building, linking, and executing GoogleTest-based tests correctly, ensuring a smooth testing experience for your projects.


## 2. Preparing a Sample Test

### Option A: Use the Provided Example Test
GoogleTest includes example test files in its repository. Using them is the fastest way to confirm a working installation.

The simplest identifiable example is a minimal test with a `main` function that runs `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, relying on tests defined with `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros. You might find these samples in the `googletest/test/` directory.

### Option B: Write Your Own Minimal Test
Create a simple C++ file named `my_first_test.cpp` with the following code:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A sample test case
TEST(SampleTestSuite, SampleTest) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);  // This should pass.
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This minimal test verifies the sanity of your GoogleTest setup.


## 3. Building Your Test

To compile your sample test code against GoogleTest, use the following commands relevant to your setup:

### Using CMake
If you have a CMakeLists.txt linking the GoogleTest package, run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Using g++ Manually
Replace `/path/to/gtest/` with your installed GoogleTest header and library directories:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I/path/to/gtest/include -L/path/to/gtest/lib my_first_test.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o my_first_test
```


## 4. Running Your First Test

Once compiled, execute your test binary:

```bash
./my_first_test
```

### Expected Output
Your output should resemble:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTestSuite
[ RUN      ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest
[       OK ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTestSuite ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms that the framework runs at least one test and reports results properly.


## 5. Running Provided GoogleTest Internal Tests

The GoogleTest repository contains comprehensive internal tests that ensure the framework's correctness, albeit some tests are designed to fail intentionally to verify error reporting.

To run them:

1. Build the GoogleTest test suite (usually via CMake).
2. Execute the test binary often located as `googletest/test/gtest_*`.

For example:

```bash
./googletest/test/gtest_environment_test
```

Check that most tests pass or fail as expected (some tests purposely fail for verification purposes).


## 6. Interpreting Exit Codes

GoogleTest uses exit codes to indicate the overall success or failure:

- `0`: All tests passed.
- `1`: Some tests failed or the framework encountered errors.

Make sure your `main()` returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to propagate this correctly.


## 7. Common Pitfalls During Verification

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues During Verification">
<Accordion title="Linker errors mentioning GoogleTest symbols">
Ensure that the test binary links against the `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries correctly. Also, link with pthread (`-pthread` on Linux).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test binary executes but no tests run">
Check if all test names follow naming conventions (no underscores). Also, verify that you have defined tests using `TEST`/`TEST_F` macros correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected test failures in sample tests">
Some internal GoogleTest tests intentionally fail to validate features. Ignore these unless running your own tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation errors related to C++ standard or headers">
Verify your compiler supports C++17 or later and that include paths to GoogleTest headers are correct.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Additional Verification Tips

- Use the flag `--gtest_list_tests` to list available tests without running them:

```bash
./my_first_test --gtest_list_tests
```

- Filter tests to execute specific ones with `--gtest_filter`.

- Enable verbose output for debugging failed tests with `--gtest_verbose=info`.


## 9. Next Steps

Once verification succeeds:

- Proceed to [Writing Your First Test](/getting-started/first-tests-and-troubleshooting/writing-your-first-test) to create meaningful tests for your code.
- Explore configuration and advanced features documented in the [GoogleTest Primer](../primer.md).
- For build integrations, see the [Installation with CMake, Bazel, Manual](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installing-with-cmake-bazel) guide.

Make sure your test executable returns 0 and reports tests as PASSED in the output. If verification fails, revisit your installation and build steps.
