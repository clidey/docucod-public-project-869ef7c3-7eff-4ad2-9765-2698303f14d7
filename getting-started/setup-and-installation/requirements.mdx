# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Understand the prerequisite tools, compilers, and supported platforms necessary to use GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Quickly verify your development environment matches the required standards and see what platforms are officially supported.

---

## 1. Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are C++ testing frameworks that support multiple platforms and compilers. Ensuring your development environment meets their system requirements is essential for a smooth installation, configuration, and use.

This page guides you through the necessary system prerequisites, recommended compilers and environments, and the platforms officially supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock.


## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock officially support the following platforms:

- **Linux** (most modern distributions)
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (Visual Studio and MSVC toolchain)
- **Cygwin** (a POSIX compatibility layer for Windows)
- **QURT** (Qualcomm Real-Time Operating System)


Each supported platform comes with particular considerations regarding available threading support and compiler compatibility.


## 3. Compiler and Language Requirements

### C++ Standard

- GoogleTest requires a compiler with support for **C++17** or later.

### Compiler Compatibility

- **GCC**: Supported versions generally 7.0 and above.
- **Clang and IntelLLVM**: Supported with most recent stable versions.
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**: Supported as a first-class compiler on Windows. Specific tweaks exist for MSVC versions (e.g., silencing specific warnings for MSVC 2015).


### Threading Support

- GoogleTest uses POSIX threads on POSIX-compliant systems like Linux, macOS, and Cygwin.
- On Windows, threading is implemented with native Windows primitives.
- Thread safety is guaranteed where pthread is available.


## 4. Tool Dependencies

- A standard-compliant C++17 compiler.
- Compatible build system (CMake recommended) configured to use appropriate compiler flags.
- Threading library support (`pthread` on POSIX; Windows native threading otherwise).


## 5. Environment Verification

Before building or using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, verify your system meets the following criteria:

### Step 1: Verify Your Compiler Version

- Run `g++ --version`, `clang++ --version`, or check MSVC version in Visual Studio.
- Confirm the version is recent enough to fully support C++17.

### Step 2: Check Threading Support

- On Linux/macOS/Cygwin, ensure pthread is installed and discoverable by your build environment.
- On Windows, Visual Studio generally satisfies threading dependencies.

### Step 3: Validate Build Tools

- Verify CMake version is at least 3.14 if using advanced features like FetchContent for GoogleTest.

### Step 4: Check for Special Platform Requirements

- If targeting QURT or other embedded platforms, verify availability of appropriate SDKs and cross-compilation support.


## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- For **Windows users**, prefer the MSVC toolchain integrated with Visual Studio. Use the recommended compiler flags to avoid warnings (e.g., suppress warning C4800 for MSVC 2015).
- Adjust compiler flags to enable strict warnings (`-W4` in MSVC or `-Wall` equivalents in GCC/Clang) to catch potential issues early during compilation.
- Confirm that exceptions and RTTI are enabled or disabled according to your project needs and GoogleTest's defaults.
- Always run tests on all target platforms early to ensure compatibility.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Compiler Does Not Support C++17 or Higher

- **Solution:** Upgrade your compiler/version or configure your build setup to use a compatible compiler.

### Problem: Missing pthread Library on POSIX Systems

- **Solution:** Install the pthread development package from your OS package manager (e.g., `libpthread` on Linux).
- Check that build scripts and CMake configurations correctly link `-lpthread`.

### Problem: MSVC Warning C4800 (forcing int to bool)

- **Solution:** This warning is silenced internally in GoogleMock source for MSVC 2015 as it relates to internal implementation. You can ignore or suppress it globally if necessary.

### Problem: Build Fails with Missing Symbols Related to Threads

- **Solution:** Ensure thread linkage is correct and that threading primitives are available for your platform.


## 8. Reference: Compiler and Platform Detection (Internal)

GoogleMock internally detects different platforms and compilers explicitly, as seen in source checks like:

- `GTEST_OS_CYGWIN`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_QURT`
- Compiler defines: `_MSC_VER` for MSVC, presence of specific warnings for particular versions

This internal detection helps GoogleTest conditionally compile and silence warnings or enable features according to the environment.

<Check>
Ensure your compiler version supports C++17.
Verify pthread support or Windows threading is available.
Confirm CMake version >= 3.14 for advanced build integration.
</Check>

<Tip>
When targeting multiple platforms, regularly test your build and mocks on each supported environment to catch platform-specific issues early.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid assuming support for platforms or compilers that are not explicitly listed as supported.
Do not ignore or disable warnings that could signal important compatibility issues.
</Warning>
