# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GoogleTest

Before you begin installing and using GoogleTest, it is essential to verify that your development environment meets the minimum requirements. This ensures a smooth build, configuration, and execution experience with GoogleTest, reducing surprises and failures later.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms & Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest is designed to be portable across major operating systems and compilers. Validate that your system falls into one of the supported categories.

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows, MacOS.
- **Compilers:**
  - GCC 7.0 or newer
  - Clang 5.0 or newer
  - Visual Studio 2017 or newer (MSVC)
  - Intel and other commonly used C++17-compliant compilers


> GoogleTest requires a compiler with **full C++17 language standard support**.


### Verifying Compiler Support

Ensure your compiler recognizes the C++17 standard and is new enough by running:

```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version
# or
clang --version
# MSVC via command prompt
cl
```

You can also test compiling a simple C++17 snippet specifying the `-std=c++17` flag (or equivalent) to confirm support.


## 2. C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest mandates that the **C++17 standard** be enabled during compilation. This can be set explicitly in your build system.

### How to Enable C++17

- **CMake:**
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- **GCC/clang via command line:**
  ```bash
  -std=c++17
  ```

- **Visual Studio:**
  Ensure your project properties use the appropriate platform toolset that supports C++17 (usually default in VS2017+).


> Without C++17, GoogleTest will fail to build or run properly.


## 3. Dependencies

GoogleTest is self-contained and has minimal dependencies, but note the following:

- **Threading Support:**
  - On POSIX-compliant systems, pthreads are used for multi-threaded tests.
  - GoogleTest auto-detects pthread availability. If detection fails, pthread usage can be enforced or disabled manually by defining:
  
    ```
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable pthread explicitly
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable pthread explicitly
    ```

- **Build Tools:**
  - CMake (version 3.14 or higher) is strongly recommended as the primary build system.
  - Make, Ninja, or corresponding build tools depending on OS.
  
- **Optional:**
  - Python3 if you want to run GoogleTestâ€™s own tests (not mandatory for general usage).


## 4. System Resources

- **Memory:** Adequate to compile and run GoogleTest and your test binaries. No special minimum but at least 1GB recommended for smooth operation.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 100MB free space for source, build artifacts, and installed binaries.


## 5. Network & Access Requirements

- To clone the GoogleTest repository, you need stable internet access unless downloading a released archive manually.
- For continuous integration environments, ensure your CI agents meet the above system and compiler requirements.


---

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- Ensure your compiler and linker flags don't conflict; GoogleTest provides CMake functions that automatically adjust appropriate flags.

- If you face linker runtime mismatches on Windows (like CRT mismatch errors), use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` during CMake configuration to align runtime linkage.

- Avoid mixing incompatible compiler settings between your project and GoogleTest (e.g., debug vs release, static vs dynamic runtime).

- If your build system does not support `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`, explicitly pass the flag in your compile options.

- Always call Google's initializer functions (`testing::InitGoogleTest()`) with proper arguments to ensure flag parsing and setup.

## Verification Checklist Before Installation

Before proceeding with installation, verify the following:

- [ ] Compiler version is C++17 compatible.
- [ ] Operating system is supported (Linux, Windows, or Mac).
- [ ] CMake version is >= 3.14 (for FetchContent use).
- [ ] Pthread support is available or explicitly disabled/enabled.
- [ ] Suitable build tools and permissions to build/install software.
- [ ] Network access for cloning or downloading GoogleTest source.

For detailed installation instructions, please see the [Installation Options](../installation-options) page.

For configuring your build and running your first tests, refer to the [Configuration & Verification](../configuration-verification) page.


<Tip>
Ensuring your environment meets these prerequisites upfront saves hours of troubleshooting later. Modern C++17 support is the cornerstone to a successful GoogleTest setup.
