# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page provides a clear overview of the essential C++ standards, compiler versions, supported platforms, and tools you need to run GoogleTest and GoogleMock successfully. Understanding these prerequisites ensures a smooth installation, proper build, and trouble-free use of the testing frameworks.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standard

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock **require C++17 or later** for compilation and execution.
- If your project build system supports it, explicitly specify this standard. For CMake, include:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If specifying in compiler flags, add:

  ```bash
  -std=c++17
  ```

- Builds with earlier C++ standards are not supported and will fail.

<Check>
Make sure your compiler and build environment support and use C++17 at a minimum.
</Check>

---

## 2. Minimum Compiler Versions and Compatibility

GoogleTest ensures compatibility with a wide range of compilers commonly used in C++ development. Below are the minimum compiler versions required:

- **GCC**: Version 7.0 or later
- **Clang**: Version 3.4.1 or later
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio)**: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
- **Intel LLVM**: Compatible with Clang versions meeting C++17

<Note>
Older compiler versions may not support C++17 features and will cause build errors.
</Note>

---

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports the following platforms thoroughly, aligning with Google’s foundational C++ support policy:

- **Linux and Unix-like systems** including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, Haiku
- **macOS and iOS** (requires Xcode development environment)
- **Windows** Desktop editions (including MinGW environments)
- **Android** (some platform restrictions may apply)

Partial or experimental support exists for embedded platforms like ESP32 and others but is not officially recommended.

See the official foundational C++ support matrix for detailed, up-to-date platform coverage:

## 4. Required Tools and Build Dependencies

### Build Tools

- **CMake** version 3.14 or later is required for building GoogleTest with the recommended CMake integration methods, including `FetchContent` usage for dependency download.
  - Download at https://cmake.org/

- For “standalone” builds without CMake, standard build tools like Make or Visual Studio project files are available.


### Additional Tools

- **Git** for cloning the source repository and managing submodules if you choose.
- **Python 3** (optional) if you plan to run test scripts dependent on it.

### Compiler and Linker Notes

- When building on Windows with Visual Studio, pay attention to runtime linkage options:
  - By default, GoogleTest links static runtimes, which may conflict with projects using dynamic runtimes.
  - Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to match dynamic linkage.

- Threading support requires pthreads or equivalent:
  - On POSIX systems, pthread support is detected automatically.
  - On Windows, native threading primitives are used.

<Warning>
Ensure the compiler and linker flags are consistent across your project and GoogleTest builds to avoid runtime crashes and linking errors.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Key Environment Macros and Features

GoogleTest auto-detects or relies on these environment features:

- **Thread-Safety**: Enabled if pthreads are available or on Windows desktop.
- **Exception Support**: The framework detects if exceptions are enabled in your compiler.
- **RTTI (Run-Time Type Information)**: Verifies that RTTI is enabled; required for some GoogleTest features.
- **File System Access**: Required for death tests and output capture.

In cases where auto-detection fails, define the following macros manually in your build as needed:

| Macro                  | Purpose                                 | Value           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`    | Manually control pthread availability   | 0 or 1          |
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` | Enable or disable exception support      | 0 or 1          |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`       | Enable or disable RTTI detection         | 0 or 1          |

Refer to the header [`gtest-port.h`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) for detailed detection logic.

## 6. Network and Access Considerations

- No network access is strictly required to build or run tests.
- If you use CMake's `FetchContent` to download GoogleTest dynamically, internet access is required during the configuration phase.

## 7. Verifying Your Environment

To confirm your development environment is ready, follow these practical checks:

1. **Check compiler version:**

   - GCC:

     ```bash
     g++ --version
     ```

   - Clang:

     ```bash
     clang++ --version
     ```

   - MSVC:

     Open Visual Studio and check version under Help > About.

2. **Confirm C++17 support:**

   Create a simple file named `test.cpp` with:

   ```cpp
   #include <optional>
   int main(){ std::optional<int> o; return 0; }
   ```

   Compile with:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test
   ./test
   ```

3. **Check pthreads availability (Linux/macOS):**

   ```bash
   ldconfig -p | grep pthread
   ```

4. **Ensure CMake version:**

   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```

5. **Confirm Visual Studio configuration (Windows):**

   - Open your project settings and verify both your project and GoogleTest use matching runtime library settings (e.g., /MD vs /MT).

<Check>
Fix any discrepancies before proceeding to installation.
</Check>

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Mixing runtimes on Windows**: Mismatched static/dynamic CRT linkages cause linker errors and subtle crashes. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtimes.

- **Unsupported compiler versions**: Attempts to build with outdated compilers fail silently or generate confusing errors. Upgrade your compiler to a version that supports C++17.

- **Embedded or constrained platforms**: GoogleTest may not fully function due to missing features like filesystem or threading support.

- **Explicitly define environment macros** if GoogleTest incorrectly detects threading or exceptions support.

- **Use updated CMake** to leverage modern fetching and integration logic.

For a smooth start, verify your environment against the above requirements before moving on to installation and configuration. Should you encounter compatibility issues, consult the troubleshooting sections in the setup and installation guides.


---

## Example: Verify Compiler and C++ Standard Support

```bash
# Check GCC version and support for C++17
g++ --version
# Expected: 7.0 or later

# Compile a simple C++17 program
echo '#include <optional> int main() { std::optional<int> o; return 0; }' > test.cpp

g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test && ./test
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo 'C++17 supported'; else echo 'Upgrade compiler'; fi
```

This completes the overview of prerequisites and system requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. With your environment properly set up, you can confidently proceed to install and integrate the framework into your projects.
