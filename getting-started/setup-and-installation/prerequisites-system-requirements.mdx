# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page details the essential environment requirements you must meet to successfully build and use GoogleTest. By understanding the supported C++ standards, compilers, operating systems, and toolchains, you can ensure a smooth integration and avoid common setup issues.

## 1. Required C++ Language Standard

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler that supports **C++17 or a more recent standard**.

- You must compile your test code and GoogleTest source with at least C++17 enabled.
- Enforce this by setting the standard version explicitly in your build system. For example, with CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If your project is primarily C, you can pass the flag manually:

```bash
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=c++17'
```

> <Tip>Always specify this explicitly to prevent subtle build failures or undefined behaviors when using features from C++17.</Tip>

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest is compatible with a broad set of C++ compilers known to support the C++17 standard, including but not limited to:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) 7.1 or later
- **Clang** 5.0 or later
- **Microsoft Visual Studio** 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later
- Other modern compilers that fully support C++17 features

> <Warning>The minimum MSVC compiler version is 19.11 (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3). Versions earlier than this may lack necessary feature support.</Warning>

## 3. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is officially tested and used on the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (multiple distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions, with full Visual Studio support)
- **macOS** (with Xcode installed)
- Other UNIX-like environments that can run compatible compilers

Platform support is heavily tested on these OSes, but GoogleTest strives to maintain compatibility on additional platforms according to community contributions.

## 4. Toolchains and Build Systems

While GoogleTest supports various build systems, the recommended and widely tested workflow leverages:

- **CMake** (minimum version 3.14 for `FetchContent` support, recommended 3.16 or above)
  - Generates native build files for your environment.
  - Supports building GoogleTest standalone or embedded into existing projects.
- **Make, Ninja, Visual Studio Build Tools, Xcode**
  - These are used as backends after configuring the build with CMake.

**Bazel** is officially supported as an alternative build system, primarily for large scale builds with GoogleTest's provided Bazel BUILD files.

> <Info>Depending on your platform and environment, ensure you have an appropriate build tool installed (e.g., `make` on Linux, Visual Studio build tools on Windows) alongside CMake.</Info>

## 5. Multi-threading Environment

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where the pthread library exists.

- On many POSIX compliant systems, this is available by default.
- On Windows, synchronization primitives are implemented internally to ensure thread safety.

If you encounter issues related to threading or want to explicitly force pthread detection, use the compiler flag:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

or disable threading with:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

> <Note>If you manually build GoogleTest without CMake, ensure to link pthreads (`-pthread`) on POSIX platforms.</Note>

## 6. Visual Studio Runtime Configuration

When building with Visual Studio, GoogleTest links the C++ runtime statically by default, which can conflict with projects that link it dynamically.

To resolve this, enable dynamic linking of the runtime libraries by passing the CMake option:

```bash
-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

This option makes GoogleTest's runtime linkage consistent with your project settings.

## 7. Summary Checklist

Before building or integrating GoogleTest, verify the following:

- Your compiler supports **C++17 or higher**.
- Your OS is one of the supported platforms: **Linux, Windows Desktop, macOS**.
- Your build environment has **CMake 3.14+** installed if you use the FetchContent integration.
- You have the required **build tools** for your OS.
- On Windows, adjust the runtime linkage with `gtest_force_shared_crt` if necessary.
- Thread safety requires pthread on POSIX; confirm `-pthread` flags when building outside CMake.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Build failure due to C++ version:** Double-check your compiler flags and enforce C++17.
- **Unrecognized platform:** GoogleTest may build but some features could be disabled; consult community forums or consider contributing fixes.
- **Linker errors for pthread:** Add appropriate `-pthread` or link via your build system.
- **Runtime library mismatch on Windows:** Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align with your project settings.
