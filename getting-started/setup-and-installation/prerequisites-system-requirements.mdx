# Prerequisites and System Requirements

GoogleTest is a robust C++ testing framework designed to work seamlessly across multiple platforms and compiler environments. Before proceeding with installation and usage, it is essential to confirm that your development environment meets the necessary requirements to build and run GoogleTest successfully.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of operating systems, with stable and well-tested support on the following major platforms:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants)
- **Mac OS X**

Additional platforms have varying levels of support and may require manual tweaks or community contributions:

- BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
- Solaris, AIX, HP-UX
- Embedded platforms such as Android, Native Client (NaCl), Fuchsia

If you are working on any other platforms, contribution of patches or feedback is welcomed by the GoogleTest maintainers.

For a full latest list and detailed platform matrix, refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) maintained by Google.

## 2. Compiler and Language Standards

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ environment with **support for C++17 or higher**. This ensures compatibility with language features and standard library enhancements used internally.

### Minimum C++ Standard:

- **C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017)** or newer is mandatory.

### Recommended Compiler Versions:

- **GCC:** 7.0 or above
- **Clang:** 3.4.1 or above
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later

Older compilers or those with incomplete C++17 support will fail to compile GoogleTest.

<Warning>
Be sure to explicitly set the C++ standard in your build system (e.g., via `-std=c++17` or CMake's `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` flag) to avoid silent compatibility issues.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Required Compiler Features and Settings

GoogleTest uses several modern C++ language features and compiler capabilities:

- Variadic macros support
- RTTI (Run-time Type Information) enabled (recommended for full features)
- Exception handling (optional but recommended)
- Support for standard threading or pthreads on POSIX systems

While GoogleTest can be built without exceptions or RTTI, some features may be limited. It is advisable to enable these features unless your environment strictly prohibits them.

---

## 4. Critical Dependencies

While GoogleTest is mostly self-contained, it relies on the following dependencies:

- **Standard C++ Library** supporting C++17
- **pthreads library** on POSIX compliant systems (Linux, Mac, BSD, etc.) for threading support
- **Abseil and RE2** libraries if `GTEST_HAS_ABSL` option is enabled in the build (optional, advanced configuration)

On Windows, threading primitives are implemented natively without the need for external pthread libraries.

---

## 5. Environment and Build System Considerations

- GoogleTest can be built as either a static or shared library. If you want to build it as a shared library (DLL), you must define `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` during compilation.
- To compile tests or code that link to GoogleTest shared libraries, define `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.
- On POSIX platforms, ensure that the pthreads library is linked if threading support is desired, typically by linking with `-lpthread` (handled automatically by CMake's `find_package(Threads)`).
- Visual Studio projects should align C++ runtime linkage (dynamic vs static) with GoogleTest settings to avoid linker errors.

---

## 6. System Resources and Network

No specific system memory or storage requirements are imposed by GoogleTest beyond normal development environment needs.

Network connectivity is not required for GoogleTest runtime; source code clones and dependency fetches require internet access only if fetching via CMake or similar tooling.

---

## 7. Summary Checklist Before Installation

Before you begin installing GoogleTest, verify the following:

- [ ] Your platform is officially supported (Linux, Windows Desktop, Mac OS X).
- [ ] Your compiler supports C++17 or newer.
- [ ] Exception handling and RTTI are enabled (recommended).
- [ ] Pthreads library is available on POSIX systems if threading is needed.
- [ ] You have correctly configured your build environment to respect the C++17 standard.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Environment Compatibility

If you encounter build errors or missing features:

- Verify your compiler version meets minimum supported versions.
- Ensure your build system sets C++17 explicitly.
- Check that pthreads library is linked on POSIX platforms.
- On Windows, ensure Visual Studio updates are installed to meet version requirements.
- Disable or define feature macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` explicitly if autodetection fails:

  ```sh
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable pthread support
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable pthread support
  ```

- Review any compile-time errors for missing C++17 or RTTI features.

For extended troubleshooting, consult the [Installation Instructions by Platform](../setup-and-installation/installation-platforms) page and the [Troubleshooting Guide](../first-test-experience/troubleshooting-and-validation).
