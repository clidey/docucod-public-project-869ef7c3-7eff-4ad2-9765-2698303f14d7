# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the minimum standards required to build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock (gMock) seamlessly. This section guides you through supported platforms, necessary compiler standards, and environmental configurations to establish a solid foundation before installation.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Environments

GoogleTest and GoogleMock operate reliably across major operating systems and development environments:

- **Linux:** Fully supported with GCC, Clang, and other modern compilers.
- **Windows:** Supported with Microsoft Visual Studio tools.
- **Mac OS X:** Supported with Xcode and compatible compilers.

Refer to [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) for a detailed matrix of supported OS versions and compiler toolchains.

### Important Notes

- GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Ensure your platform adheres to this policy.
- Multi-threaded tests require pthread library support; verify your platform provides it or can simulate it.

---

## 2. Compiler and C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler. Confirm the following before proceeding:

- **C++ Standard:** Minimum C++17 support is mandatory. If your build system requires explicit specification, set the standard accordingly.
  - For CMake:  
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```

- **Compiler Compatibility:** Verified support exists for recent versions of GCC, Clang, MSVC, and Apple Clang.

- **Threading Support:** For thread-safe tests, pthreads support is required (especially on Unix-like systems). Set the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` flag if the detection fails.

> Ensure your build flags and toolchain are consistent throughout your project to avoid linking or runtime issues.

---

## 3. System Resources and Dependencies

GoogleTest and gMock have minimal footprint but require the following:

- **Memory:** At least 256 MB of RAM is recommended to build and run tests comfortably.

- **Disk Space:** A few megabytes for source code and binaries. Ensure you have enough space for your project and test outputs.

- **Build Tools:**
  - C++17 compatible compiler
  - CMake 3.14 or later if using the CMake build system
  - Git for cloning repositories (optional but recommended)

- **Network:** Internet connection required if downloading GoogleTest via CMake's FetchContent or git submodules.

---

## 4. Access and Permissions

- Sufficient permissions to install libraries or dependencies on your machine.
- For Linux/macOS, ensure you can execute commands like `sudo make install` if performing system-wide installs.

---

## 5. Tweaks and Control Macros

GoogleTest can be customized with macros to tweak behavior or fix environment-specific issues.

- Common macros:
  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to manually control threading support.
  - `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to build a shared library instead of static.
  - `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to compile tests using the shared library.

Consult the [googletest internal port header](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) for the full list.

---

## 6. Common Environment Pitfalls

- **Compiler Flags:** Mismatched runtime library flags in Visual Studio can cause linker errors. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to harmonize runtimes.

- **C++ Standard Mismatch:** Confirm all components (GoogleTest, your code, dependencies) use the same C++ standard to avoid ABI issues.

- **Threading:** Tests that use assertions in multi-threaded contexts require correct pthread detection and linkage.

- **Permissions:** Insufficient permissions during install or file writing can cause cryptic failures.

---

## 7. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding to install and write tests, verify your system readiness:

1. Run your compiler with `--version` or equivalent to confirm version and C++17 support.
2. Test CMake version:

   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```

3. Confirm pthread availability if on Unix/Linux:

   ```bash
   echo '#include <pthread.h>' | gcc -x c - -o /dev/null && echo 'pthread available' || echo 'pthread missing'
   ```

4. Check permissions for build and install directories.

## 8. Next Steps

Once your environment meets these prerequisites and system requirements, proceed to the next documentation page:

- [Installation via CMake](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation-via-cmake)
- [Installation via Bazel](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation-via-bazel)

These guides will walk you through building and installing GoogleTest and GoogleMock on your platform.
