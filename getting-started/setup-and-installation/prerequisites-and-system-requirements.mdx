# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the minimum compiler, platform, and C++ standard requirements to successfully use GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page guides you through the essential compatibility checks and environmental settings so you can set up and start authoring reliable tests with confidence.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and OS

GoogleTest supports a wide range of operating systems and platforms aligned with Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. Confirm that your platform is compatible before proceeding.

**Supported Operating Systems include:**

- Linux (including Android)
- Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants)
- macOS
- BSD variations (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD)
- Solaris
- Other Unix-like platforms (AIX, HP-UX, DragonFlyBSD, Haiku)

<Callout>
For a comprehensive and up-to-date list of supported platforms, refer to the [Supported Platforms documentation](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).
</Callout>

---

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler that supports at least the C++17 standard. This ensures all features and language constructs that GoogleTest depends on are available.

### Minimum Compiler Versions (Indicative):

| Compiler          | Minimum Version Supporting C++17 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| GCC               | 7.0+                             |
| Clang             | 5.0+                             |
| MSVC (Visual Studio) | 2017 Update 3 (v19.11)+        |
| Intel LLVM        | Versions supporting C++17        |


<Note>
GoogleTest enforces the use of the C++17 standard or later at compile time. Compilation will fail on older standard versions.
</Note>

---

## 3. C++ Standard

- **C++ Standard Version:** GoogleTest requires **C++17** or later.
- Ensure your build system explicitly sets the C++ language standard:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If you cannot modify the project-wide settings (e.g., in a CMake project where GoogleTest is a subdirectory), you may alternatively append compiler flags manually:

  ```bash
  -std=c++17  # GCC/Clang
  /std:c++17  # MSVC
  ```

---

## 4. Threading Support

GoogleTest is fully thread-safe on platforms where POSIX threads (`pthread`) are available or on Windows with native threading primitives.

### Automatic Detection and Override:

- GoogleTest auto-detects pthread availability.
- If detection fails or platform uses a custom environment, set:

  ```bash
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1    # Enable pthread support
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0    # Disable pthread support
  ```

- When using CMake, the pthread library is automatically linked if detected.

<Tip>
If you experience link errors related to pthread, verify that your build flags include `-pthread` or link against the pthread library explicitly.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Build Tools and Environment

GoogleTest comes with a CMake build script, which is the recommended and best-supported way to build the framework.

### Required Tools:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.14 or later
- Compatible C++ compiler (see section above)
- Supported native build system:
  - GNU Make
  - Ninja
  - MSBuild / Visual Studio
  - Xcode (macOS)

### Installation of CMake:

Refer to the official [CMake installation guide](https://cmake.org/install).

<Note>
CMake's FetchContent module (used in example projects and recommended workflows) requires CMake 3.14+.
</Note>

---

## 6. Environment and Configuration Macros

GoogleTest provides compiler macros to tweak its behavior and resolve environment-specific issues.

### Commonly Used Macros:

| Macro                          | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY`  | Compile GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL) |
| `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` | Compile test binaries to link with shared DLL |
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`            | Explicitly enable/disable pthread detection    |
| `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO>`   | Rename conflicting GoogleTest macros (e.g. `TEST`) |

<Info>
These macros are typically set in your build system's compiler flags to control GoogleTest's build and runtime behavior.
</Info>

## 7. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always verify that your compiler flags explicitly define C++17 support.
- When mixing GoogleTest with your project, prefer building GoogleTest as part of your project using `add_subdirectory()` in CMake to ensure compatibility.
- On Windows, pay special attention to the runtime linkage flags (`gtest_force_shared_crt`) to prevent conflicts between static and dynamic runtime linkage.

<Tip>
If using Visual Studio, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in your CMake to align the C runtime linkage with your project settings.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

### Problem: Compilation fails due to unsupported C++ standard

**Solution:**
- Confirm your compiler version supports C++17.
- Add or update your build system's `-std=c++17` flag or equivalent.

### Problem: Link errors related to pthread

**Solution:**
- Add `-pthread` flag to compiler and linker options.
- For CMake, ensure `find_package(Threads)` succeeds and links pthread.

### Problem: Runtime issues with mismatched CRT on Windows

**Solution:**
- Enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake to ensure consistent runtime linkage.

<Tip>
Always consult the [Installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows](../installation-on-linux-macos-windows.md) page next for platform-specific installation instructions.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

After confirming your system meets these prerequisites:

- Proceed to the [Installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows](../installation-on-linux-macos-windows.md) page to learn how to build and install GoogleTest.
- Explore [Configuring Your Project](../configuring-your-project.md) to integrate GoogleTest into your development workflow.
