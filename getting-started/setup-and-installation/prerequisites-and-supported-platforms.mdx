# Prerequisites and Supported Platforms

Ensure you have the right environment before building and using GoogleTest. This guide details the required C++ standard, supported operating systems, compilers, and build tools essential for compatibility and smooth operation.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17 or later**.

- Attempting to build with earlier C++ standards will result in compilation errors.
- If your project uses CMake, specify the C++ standard with:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- For manual builds or other build systems, ensure your compiler flags enable C++17 support (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).

<Tip>
Always verify your compiler's C++17 compliance, as GoogleTest relies on C++17 language features and standard library support.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest officially supports a broad range of platforms following Google's foundational C++ support policy. The most stable, actively maintained platforms include:

- **Linux (various distributions and kernels)**
- **Windows (Desktop editions including MinGW)**
- **macOS**

Additional supported or partially supported operating systems, often requiring more caution or community involvement, include:

- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
- Fuchsia (note: unofficial support)
- Cygwin

<Tip>
While GoogleTest compiles on many other Unix-like and embedded systems, support stability may vary. If using a less common platform, verify your build success and consider contributing fixes.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest works with the following compiler families, assuming C++17 support:

- **GCC 7.x and newer**
- **Clang 5.x and newer**
- **MSVC 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) and newer**
- **Intel C++ Compiler with C++17 support**

<Tip>
Ensure you use a modern compiler release with full C++17 support for best compatibility and performance.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Build Tools and Systems

You can build GoogleTest using these popular tools:

- **CMake (version 3.14 or later recommended)**
  - Generates native build files (Makefiles, Visual Studio projects, Xcode projects).
  - Supports fetching and embedding GoogleTest sources via `FetchContent`.
- **Make** (on Unix-like systems)
- **Visual Studio** (on Windows)
- **Bazel** (GoogleTest includes Bazel build configurations)

For CMake, see [Quickstart: Building with CMake](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/quickstart-cmake.md).

<Tip>
CMake is the recommended approach for most platforms due to flexibility and ease of integration.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Platform Detection and Configuration

GoogleTest automatically detects the target platform during compilation and configures its internal settings accordingly. This includes:

- Operating system macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`).
- Feature availability (e.g., thread support, regex library usage).

You generally do not need to override these settings manually, but build scripts can define macros such as `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` if auto-detection fails.

<Tip>
If your platform is not automatically detected correctly, forcing specific macros can help resolve build or runtime issues.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Threading and Exceptions Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support or Windows desktop.
- Exceptions support detection is automatic; if disabled in your compiler, tests will adapt accordingly.

You can explicitly enable or disable threading and exceptions via build defines.

---

## 7. File System and Stream Redirection

- GoogleTest requires file system support for features like death tests.
- Stream redirection (capturing stdout and stderr) is supported on most platforms but disabled on some mobile and embedded systems.

## 8. Common Prerequisite Checks Before Building

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Verify Compiler Compatibility">
Confirm that your compiler supports C++17.

```bash
# GCC example
g++ --version
# Clang example
clang++ --version
# MSVC example
cl
```
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Confirm Operating System Support">
Check that your OS matches one of the officially supported systems.

```bash
uname -a     # Linux / macOS
ver          # Windows
```
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Ensure Build Tools Are Installed">
Verify CMake or your preferred build tool is installed.

```bash
cmake --version
make --version
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## 9. Troubleshooting Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="C++17 Not Supported by Compiler">
Update your compiler to a version supporting C++17 or adjust your build environment to use a suitable compiler.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Operating System">
Consider compiling on a supported OS or submitting patches for community support. Verify community forums and mailing lists for help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Build Tools">
Install CMake, Make, or other necessary tools via your OS package manager or official download sites.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Support Issues">
Use the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` flag on platforms with pthread but undetected support.
</Accordion>
