# Troubleshooting & Quick Validation

This guide empowers you to swiftly diagnose and resolve common setup problems with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It helps you confirm your environment is properly configured for running tests and mocks by providing a clear validation checklist, typical failure examples, and practical solutions.

---

## 1. Quick Environment Validation Checklist
Before diving into writing or running tests, confirm your setup meets these essential requirements:

- **Compiler Support:** Verify your compiler supports C++17 or higher.
- **Build Tools:** Confirm CMake or your chosen build system is correctly installed and in your system path.
- **GoogleTest & GoogleMock Installed:** Ensure you have downloaded and built GoogleTest, which includes GoogleMock.
- **Virtual Destructor in Interfaces:** Make sure any interfaces you mock have virtual destructors to prevent undefined behavior.
- **Include Directories Configured:** Your build should include `<gmock/gmock.h>` and `<gtest/gtest.h>` from the correct paths.

Performing these steps early eliminates many common pitfalls.

---

## 2. Validating GoogleMock Flags and Initialization
GoogleMock uses runtime flags to control its behavior and verbosity. Proper initialization is key.

### How to Initialize GoogleMock Correctly
Call `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` before running tests to let GoogleMock parse and handle its flags.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Checking Flag Values
You can verify and adjust verbose output and other flag values programmatically:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// Set verbosity to "info" for detailed output
GMOCK_FLAG_SET(verbose, "info");

// Check if catch_leaked_mocks flag is enabled
bool catchLeaks = GMOCK_FLAG_GET(catch_leaked_mocks);
```

<Note>
Always initialize GoogleMock before running tests to prevent unprocessed flags causing unintended behavior.
</Note>

## 3. Common Setup Issues and Solutions
Developers new to GoogleMock and GoogleTest often run into the following issues:

### Issue: Test Code Calls Real Methods Instead of Mocks
**Cause:** Mocked methods are not `virtual`.

**Solution: Ensure all methods you want to mock are declared virtual.**

```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual int Bar() = 0;  // Must be virtual.
};
```

---

### Issue: Unexpected "Uninteresting function call" Warnings
**Cause:** Mock method is called but no expectation set.

**Solution A:** Add an `EXPECT_CALL` for the method:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

**Solution B:** Use `NiceMock` wrapper to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
```

---

### Issue: Tests Fail Due to Incorrect Expectation Order
**Cause:** Calls happened in a different order than expectations.

**Solution:** Use `InSequence` to enforce strict call order:

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

---

### Issue: Compiler Errors When Mocking Methods with Commas in Types
**Cause:** Unprotected commas confuse the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

**Solution:** Wrap complex return or argument types with extra parentheses or use `using` type aliases:

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<int, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, ProcessMap, ((std::map<int, std::string>), bool));
};

// Or alternatively
using IntStringMap = std::map<int, std::string>;
MOCK_METHOD(bool, ProcessMap, (IntStringMap, bool));
```

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Validation of a Test Setup
Follow this sequence to ensure your GoogleMock environment is ready:

### Step 1: Build a Simple Mock Class
Create a minimal mock class for an interface with virtual methods:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Interface {
 public:
  virtual ~Interface() {}
  virtual int Foo(int x) = 0;
};

class MockInterface : public Interface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Foo, (int x), (override));
};
```

### Step 2: Write a Simple Test Using the Mock
Write a GoogleTest unit test verifying mock behavior:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MockTest, BasicExpectation) {
  MockInterface mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(testing::_)).WillOnce(testing::Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Foo(10), 42);
}
```

### Step 3: Compile and Run the Test
Compile the test, linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries. Run it to verify it passes and outputs as expected.

### Step 4: Observe and Interpret Test Output
- Success looks like a clean pass with no warnings or failures.
- Failure messages will report mismatched calls, unsatisfied expectations, or unexpected calls.

<Tip>
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` when running tests to get detailed insight about mock call matches, expectation invocations, and potential mismatches.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Failure Scenarios

### Failure: Actual function call count doesn't match expectation

```text
Expected: to be called once
Actual: never called;
```

**Cause:** Your code did not invoke the mocked method as expected.

**Fix:** Ensure your test exercises the code path that triggers the mock call.

---

### Failure: Unexpected mock function call

```text
Expected: never called
Actual: called unexpectedly
```

**Cause:** The mock received a call with arguments that do not match expectations.

**Fix:** Add or update `EXPECT_CALL` to cover this call or refine matchers.

---

### Failure: Mock object is leaked

GoogleMock can detect leaked mocks which are constructed but never destroyed.

**Fix:** Ensure all mocks are properly deleted or scoped to stack variables.

```cpp
// Use stack allocation or scoped pointers.
MockFoo mock;
// or
std::unique_ptr<MockFoo> mock_ptr = std::make_unique<MockFoo>();
```

## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always set expectations *before* exercising the code. GoogleMock expects expectations to be established ahead of mock method calls.
- Use `ON_CALL` to provide default behaviors without strict call count expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to assert that calls must occur.
- For mocks that are not critical to the test, consider wrapping them in `NiceMock` to reduce noise.
- Virtual destructors in interfaces prevent subtle bugs and memory issues.
- If your mock methods are overloaded, specify argument types explicitly or provide disambiguators to help GoogleMock.

## 7. When to Seek Additional Help
If these steps do not resolve your issues:

- Consult the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) for a full test-writing workflow.
- Review [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) to deepen your understanding.
- Explore the [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html) for advanced features.
- Check the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html) for common queries.
- Use verbose flags (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to trace mock calls in test runs.

<Check>
If you continue to experience unexpected behaviors, ensure your compiler and build environment meet the requirements outlined in the System Requirements page.
