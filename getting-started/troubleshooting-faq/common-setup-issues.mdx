# Common Setup Issues & Solutions

This guide presents a targeted collection of the most frequent installation and integration problems encountered while setting up GoogleTest and GoogleMock, along with clear, actionable solutions. By addressing these issues proactively, you can minimize downtime and accelerate your journey to running and testing your first mock-enabled tests.

---

## 1. Installation Issues

### Problem: GoogleMock Not Found or Header Files Missing

If your build system cannot find `gmock/gmock.h` or related headers:

1. **Verify Install Location**: Ensure GoogleMock is built and installed correctly, typically together with GoogleTest.
2. **Include Path Setup**: Confirm that your project's include paths reference the root directory containing `gmock/`. For example, if the include is:

   ```cpp
   #include <gmock/gmock.h>
   ```

   Your compiler option must include the folder that contains the `gmock` directory.
3. **CMake Projects**: When using CMake, link against `gmock` and `gmock_main` targets properly, which internally add include directories.

### Problem: Linking Errors for gmock Symbols

Common symptoms: linker errors for symbols defined in `gmock`.

- Verify that both `libgmock.a` and `libgtest.a` libraries are compiled and linked, as GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest.
- Ensure your linker options include `-lgmock -lgtest` or the corresponding static/dynamic library files.
- If building manually, compile `gmock_main.cc` and link it in your test executable, or use the provided `gmock_main` target in CMake.

### Problem: Using GoogleMock Requires C++11 or Later

GoogleMock requires a compiler with full C++11 support. If you encounter syntax errors:

- Verify compiler version supports C++11 or higher.
- Use compile flags like `-std=c++11` (GCC/Clang) or `/std:c++14` (MSVC).

If upgrading the compiler is not feasible, consider older versions of GoogleMock, but this is discouraged.

---

## 2. Usage and Runtime Issues

### Problem: Unrecognized Command-Line Flags are Passed Unfiltered

GoogleMock's `InitGoogleMock()` filters and absorbs `--gmock_*` flags from the command line.

- If you see unrecognized flag errors, ensure your test program is calling `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` early.
- Do not add `EXPECT_CALL` before `InitGoogleMock`.

### Problem: Unexpected Behavior with `--gmock_verbose` Flag

The verbosity flag controls how GoogleMock logs warnings and informational messages:

- `error`: Only errors.
- `warning`: Warnings and errors (default).
- `info`: Verbose information, including stack traces.

To set verbosity programmatically:

```cpp
GMOCK_FLAG_SET(verbose, "info");
```

Use this to diagnose unexpected mock call warnings or to reduce noise during testing.

### Problem: "Uninteresting Function Call" Warnings

These warnings occur when a mock method with no `EXPECT_CALL` is invoked.

**Solutions:**

- Use `ON_CALL()` to define default mock behavior if you expect calls without strict verification.
- Wrap your mock class in `NiceMock<>` to suppress uninteresting call warnings globally.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
```

- If you want to treat them as errors, use `StrictMock<>` instead.

### Problem: Mock Methods Call Real Implementations Instead of Mocks

Ensure that the functions you want to mock are declared `virtual` in your class. GoogleMock can only mock virtual methods unless you adopt specific advanced techniques.

---

## 3. Common Build and Runtime Pitfalls

### Compiler Errors Involving Commas in Types

If the return type or parameter types include commas (e.g. `std::pair<bool, int>`), you must wrap the entire type in parentheses in the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

Example:

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
```

Alternatively, use a type alias to avoid awkward syntax:

```cpp
using BoolIntPair = std::pair<bool, int>;
MOCK_METHOD(BoolIntPair, GetPair, ());
```

### Linking Against gmock_main

If you want your tests to have a ready-made main function that runs all tests:

- Link against `gmock_main` library.
- Alternatively, provide your own `main()` which calls `testing::InitGoogleMock()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Unexpected call failures despite correct expectations

Run tests with:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This will print detailed trace information on mock calls and helps uncover mismatched argument matchers or ordering problems.

### Slow Compilation with Large Mock Classes

If compilation takes unusually long:

- Define mock class constructors and destructors out of line (in `.cc`), reducing compiler workload.
- Limit the number of mocked methods if possible.

---

## 4. Troubleshooting Integration

### Incomplete or Missing Mock Methods

- Always declare `MOCK_METHOD` in the `public:` section of the mock class, regardless of the base method's access level.
- Mock overloaded or template methods carefully, specifying all overloads if necessary.

### Mock Class Strictness Conflicts

- Do **not** nest `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` (e.g. `NiceMock<StrictMock<MyMock>>`). This is unsupported.
- Use one strictness modifier per mock class hierarchy.

### Unknown Return Types Causing Failures

- If a mock method returns a type without a default constructor and no default action is specified, invoking it causes failures.
- Provide default actions or return suitable default values.

---

## 5. Helpful Tips and Best Practices

### Using Strictness Modifiers

- Use `NiceMock<>` to silence warnings about unexpected mock calls when those calls are expected or unimportant.
- Use `StrictMock<>` to catch unexpected calls as test failures early.
- Default mock is currently "naggy" (warns on uninteresting calls), but this will change to "nice" in future releases.

### Managing Uninteresting Calls

If you want to allow calls with any arguments to a mock method without warnings:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

This explicitly tells gMock these calls are expected any number of times.

### Verifying and Clearing Expectations Manually

If your mock object persists beyond the scope of a test, call:

```cpp
testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);
```

before the test ends to verify expectations without relying on destructor.

### Handling Move-Only Method Arguments

GoogleMock supports move-only types (like `std::unique_ptr`) in mocked methods. Use lambdas for custom behavior as `Return()` with move-only values may only be invoked once.

## 7. Troubleshooting Checklist

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Related to GoogleMock">
1. Confirm both GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are built and linked.
2. Link against `gmock_main` if using the supplied main function.
3. Check your build commands or CMake configuration for missing libraries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected 'Uninteresting Call' Warnings">
- Use `NiceMock<>` to suppress warnings globally.
- Define default behaviors with `ON_CALL` when calls without expectations are expected.
- Add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors Making Mock Classes">
- Wrap complex return types containing commas in parentheses.
- Use type aliases as a cleaner alternative.
- Compile with at least C++11 support enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Methods Called Are Not Virtual">
- Ensure all functions you wish to mock are declared `virtual` in base classes.
- Non-virtual functions cannot be mocked directly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always call `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` early in your test executable to properly process GoogleMock flags and initialize the framework.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleMock currently defaults to "naggy" mocks, which warn on uninteresting calls. It will change to "nice" in future releases. Consider using `NiceMock<>` today to ease migration.
</Note>

## 8. Example: Minimal Test Setup with gMock

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (), ());
};

TEST(FooTest, Basic) {
  testing::NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar());

  mock.Bar();  // Works without warnings due to NiceMock
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Run with:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gmock_verbose=info
```

To see detailed mock call trace.
