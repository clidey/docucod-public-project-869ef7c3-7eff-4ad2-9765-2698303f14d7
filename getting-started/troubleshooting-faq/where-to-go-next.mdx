# Next Steps & Learning Resources

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and run your first test using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page will guide you on how to build on this foundation, deepen your understanding of GoogleTest, and connect with resources to accelerate your productivity.

---

## What You’ve Achieved

By completing the initial setup and first test, you have:

- Installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock correctly on your platform.
- Configured your project to compile and link against GoogleTest.
- Written and run a basic test case verifying a simple behavior.
- Experienced the test execution workflow and output formatting.

You are now ready to leverage the full power and flexibility of GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Write More Advanced Tests

Explore writing tests with richer features and scenarios:

- Use **test fixtures** (`TEST_F`) to share setup and tear-down logic.
- Create **parameterized tests** for running the same test logic with multiple inputs.
- Experiment with **assertions** and **matchers** to verify complex conditions in a readable way.

Start with [Writing Your First Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/getting-started-with-googletest/writing-your-first-test) and advance to [Using Assertions and Matchers Effectively](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/advanced-testing-and-best-practices/assertions-matchers).

### 2. Dive Into Mocking Techniques

Master how to create and use mock objects with GoogleMock:

- Define mocks with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` and control mock behavior.
- Understand common matchers, actions, and cardinalities for flexible tests.
- Manage sequences and partial orderings of calls.

Begin by reading [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies) to grasp core concepts, then deepen with the [Mocking Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book) and [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking).

### 3. Improve Your Test Infrastructure

- Learn how to configure your build system for efficient testing.
- Integrate with Continuous Integration (CI) environments.
- Customize test execution and output handling for better feedback.

The [Configuring Your Project](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/initial-setup-usage/project-configuration) guide provides practical setup tips.

## Helpful Tips & Best Practices

- **Set expectations before exercising mocks:** Always declare your `EXPECT_CALL` statements before invoking the mocked methods to avoid undefined behaviors.
- **Avoid over-specification:** Use the right balance in matchers and cardinalities; don’t make tests brittle by expecting too much detail.
- **Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior:** Specify mock default behaviors that don’t need verification separately from expectations.
- **Employ `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wisely:** To manage warnings on uninteresting calls or treat unexpected calls as errors.
- **Follow test naming conventions:** Descriptive test names improve maintainability and debugging.

---

## Troubleshooting & Getting Help

If you encounter issues or unexpected behaviors:

- Run your tests with the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get detailed call traces.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Installation and Build Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/troubleshooting-faq/common-install-issues) guide.
- Check GoogleTest's [FAQ sections](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/troubleshooting-faq/).
- Engage with the community via GitHub issues or forums.
