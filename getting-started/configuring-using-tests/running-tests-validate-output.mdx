# Running Tests & Interpreting Output

This guide explains how to run your GoogleTest suite and understand the output it produces. After writing and building your tests, this page will help you execute them, interpret the console logs, and know your next steps once you get your first passing or failing test results.

---

## 1. Running Your Test Suite

GoogleTest test executables are standalone programs that automatically discover and run all tests compiled into them. You can run your built tests directly from your terminal or IDE. Here’s how to proceed:

### Step 1: Build Your Tests

Make sure your tests are compiled and linked with the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.

### Step 2: Run the Test Binary

Execute the compiled test binary from your command line. For example:

```bash
./my_test_binary
```

By default, this runs all test cases and prints a summary to the terminal.

---

### Optional: Use Command Line Flags

GoogleTest supports flags to control which tests to run, output formats, verbosity, and more.

Common flags:

- `--gtest_filter=PATTERN` — Run tests matching the pattern.
- `--gtest_repeat=N` — Repeat the test N times.
- `--gtest_shuffle` — Randomize the order of tests.
- `--gtest_color=yes` — Enable colored output.
- `--gtest_output=xml:filename.xml` — Output test results in XML format.

Example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.* --gtest_color=yes
```

---

## 2. Understanding Console Output

GoogleTest outputs the status of each test and a summary, which includes helpful cues about test success or failure.

### Typical Output Example (Passing Tests)

```plaintext
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from MyTestSuite
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test1
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.Test1 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test2
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.Test2 (1 ms)
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test3
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.Test3 (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from MyTestSuite (1 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

- `[ RUN ]` indicates a test is starting.
- `[ OK ]` means the test passed.
- `[ PASSED ]` summary states all tests succeeded.

### Typical Output Example (Failing Tests)

```plaintext
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test1
/path/to/test_file.cc:42: Failure
Expected: value1 == value2
  Actual: 3 vs 4
[  FAILED  ] MyTestSuite.Test1 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test2
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.Test2 (1 ms)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] MyTestSuite.Test1

 1 FAILED TEST
```

- Failure messages show file name, line number, and reason.
- `[ FAILED ]` marks failing tests.
- Post-run summary enumerates passed vs failed tests.

### Interpreting Assertion Failures

When a test fails, GoogleTest shows exactly which assertion failed, its expected and actual values, and a stack trace.

For example:

```plaintext
my_test.cc:10: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  foo
    Which is: 5
  bar
    Which is: 7
```

This tells you the test compared two values `foo` and `bar`, and they did not match.

## 3. Example Walkthrough: Running and Understanding Output

Let’s look at a simple scenario.

1. Build your tests.
2. Run `./my_test_binary` in your terminal.
3. Observe output showing each test starting and either passing or failing.
4. When a failure occurs, examine the file and line number reported.
5. Fix the bug or test code accordingly.

The detailed output includes:
- The failing expectation or assertion.
- The function call and arguments involved (especially with mocks).
- Possible stack traces for easier navigation.

---

## 4. What to Do After Your First Green (or Red) Bar

- If all tests pass:
  - Celebrate your success!
  - Try adding more tests or test suites.
  - Explore more advanced features like parameterized tests, death tests, or mocks.
- If some tests fail:
  - Carefully read the failure messages and stack traces.
  - Fix the problem in your production or test code.
  - Rerun your tests until all pass.

---

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get detailed logs of mock calls if you use GoogleMock.
- Use your IDE or debugger integration to jump directly to the failing test's source location.
- Use test filters to run just the tests you are working on.
- Keep your test output clean to quickly catch failures.
- Regularly verify and clear mocks to avoid state leak issues.

<Note>
GoogleTest automatically verifies mock expectations when mock objects are destructed. Leaking mocks will result in warning messages.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Test Run Issues

| Issue                          | Description                                                                  | Solution / Next Steps                                            |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test executable runs no tests  | Possible missing test registrations or wrong test fixture setup.              | Check your test macros and build settings.                       |
| Tests silently fail or pass incorrectly | Missing assertions or logic errors.                                      | Add explicit assertions; verify test logic.                      |
| Excessive test run time        | Many tests or expensive operations in tests.                                 | Use test filters; optimize setup and teardown; mock dependencies.|
| Failure messages unclear       | Complex assertions or insufficient diagnostic messages.                      | Use verbose flags or add custom failure messages.                |

## Summary

Running GoogleTest involves compiling your test suite into a binary and executing it. Output is designed to clearly show which tests passed or failed with detailed diagnostic information. Learning to interpret this output efficiently is crucial to rapid test development and maintenance.
