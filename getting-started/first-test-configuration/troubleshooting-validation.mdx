# Troubleshooting and Installation Validation

Ensuring that your GoogleTest installation is correct and your test environment is properly configured is essential for a smooth onboarding experience. This guide helps you verify your setup, identify common issues during build and linking phases, and provides actionable solutions to get your tests running reliably.

---

## 1. Verifying Your Installation

Before diving into writing tests, confirm that GoogleTest is installed and linked correctly.

### Steps to Validate Installation

1. **Include GoogleTest Header**
   Add the following to a sample test file `sample_test.cc`:
   ```cpp
   #include <gtest/gtest.h>

   TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
     EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
   }
   ```

2. **Build the Test**
   Use your build system to compile and link the test. If you use CMake, ensure the following lines are present:
   ```cmake
   find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
   target_link_libraries(your_test_target GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)
   ```

3. **Run the Tests**
   Execute the resulting test binary. Look for output like:
   ```
   [==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
   [----------] Global test environment set-up.
   [----------] 1 test from SampleTest
   [ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
   [       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
   [----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

   [----------] Global test environment tear-down
   [==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
   [  PASSED  ] 1 test.
   ```

### Success Criteria

- Test suite runs without errors.
- The test passes and reports `[  PASSED  ]` status.
- No linker, compiler, or runtime errors occur.

## 2. Common Issues and Fixes

If your validation does not succeed, the problems often fall into one of the following categories:

### 2.1 Missing Headers or Library

**Symptoms:**

- Compiler error: `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory`
- Linker error: `undefined reference to testing::InitGoogleTest` or similar

**Solutions:**

- Confirm GoogleTest is installed.
- Verify include paths contain GoogleTest headers.
- Ensure test targets link against `gtest` and optionally `gtest_main` libraries.
- For CMake, prefer `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` or add GoogleTest as a subdirectory.

### 2.2 Linker Errors on `main()`

**Symptoms:**

- Link error indicating multiple or missing definitions of `main()`.

**Solutions:**

- If using the GoogleTest-provided `gtest_main` library, do not provide your own `main()`.
- If writing your own `main()`, link only with `gtest` and not `gtest_main`.
- Ensure consistent usage across your test binaries.

### 2.3 Runtime Errors on Threads or Shared Libraries

**Symptoms:**

- Issues related to missing pthread or threading support on Linux.
- Symbol resolution errors at runtime.

**Solutions:**

- Link with pthread library: add `-pthread` or equivalent in your linker flags.
- Confirm library paths for dynamic linker include GoogleTest libraries.
- Verify compatible compiler flags between your test and GoogleTest libraries.

### 2.4 Compilation Issues for C++17 or Later

**Symptoms:**

- Errors related to C++ standard features or missing language support.

**Solutions:**

- Use a C++17 or later compliant compiler.
- In your build system, add compiler flags like `-std=c++17`.
- Check that GoogleTest sources are built with the same C++ standard.

### 2.5 GoogleMock Initialization Issues

If you use GoogleMock (`gmock`), initialization requires special care.

**Note:** Call `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` instead of just `InitGoogleTest`.

**Example main function for GoogleMock:**

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

See the file [`googlemock/src/gmock_main.cc`](googlemock/src/gmock_main.cc) for a reference implementation.

## 3. Tips for Smooth Setup

- **Keep Versions Consistent:** Use the same release/version of GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries if using both.
- **Check Dependencies:** Ensure dependencies like pthreads and standard C++ libraries are available.
- **Use Provided Build Tools:** Use CMake or Bazel build files provided by GoogleTest when possible.
- **Validate with Minimal Tests:** Start with a minimal test suite like the `SampleTest` shown above.
- **Enable Verbose Output:** Use the `--gtest_brief=1` flag to suppress passed test output or `--gtest_color=yes` to enhance readability.

## 4. Verifying Advanced Features

Once basic installation is validated, you can test GoogleTest features progressively:

### 4.1 Assertions Validation

Write tests using `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*` macros to verify correctness.

### 4.2 Test Fixtures & Parameterized Tests

Create test fixtures using `TEST_F` and parameterized tests using `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### 4.3 Mocking with GoogleMock

Include `gmock/gmock.h` and write mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD`. Verify mock behaviors with `EXPECT_CALL`.

For detailed examples, see [GoogleMock README](googlemock/README.md) and [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md).

## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

- Did you include `<gtest/gtest.h>` in your tests?
- Did you link against `gtest` and optionally `gtest_main`?
- Is your compiler using at least C++17 standard?
- Are all dependencies (libraries, threading) satisfied?
- Are you using the proper initialization calls in your `main()` function?
