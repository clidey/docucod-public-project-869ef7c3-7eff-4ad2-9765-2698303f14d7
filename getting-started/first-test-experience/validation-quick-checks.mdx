# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist provides a concise set of steps to verify that your GoogleTest installation is correctly set up and functional. It guides you through compiling a simple test, linking it properly with the GoogleTest framework, running the test executable, and confirming that the expected output is produced. Completing these steps empowers you to confidently move forward and write more complex tests.

---

## 1. Compile a Simple GoogleTest File

Start by creating a basic test file to ensure GoogleTest compiles without error.

### Example Test File: `simple_test.cpp`
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, Truth) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Compilation Command (Using `g++` as example)
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem <path-to-googletest>/include -pthread \
    simple_test.cpp <path-to-googletest>/lib/libgtest.a \
    <path-to-googletest>/lib/libgtest_main.a -o simple_test
```

- Replace `<path-to-googletest>` with the actual path where GoogleTest is installed.
- Include appropriate flags based on your platform and compiler.

### Tips:
- If you use CMake or Bazel as per your installation, refer to their integration instructions in the respective documentation.
- On Windows, adjust the compiler and linker commands accordingly, ensuring you link against the correct `.lib` files and include appropriate threading options.

---

## 2. Link Properly With GoogleTest Libraries

Ensure your build commands or build system configurations:

- Include the GoogleTest headers (`-I` or include directories).
- Link against **both** `libgtest` and `libgtest_main` libraries.
- Link with pthreads or threading libraries if on Linux or macOS (`-pthread` flag).

### Verification Command
```bash
ldd simple_test  # Linux/macOS
```

You should see linked GoogleTest libraries and system dependencies. On Windows, use tools such as `Dependency Walker` to confirm.

---

## 3. Run the Test Executable

Execute the compiled binary to verify that GoogleTest starts and runs your test.

```bash
./simple_test
```

### Expected Output
```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest
[ RUN      ] SimpleTest.Truth
[       OK ] SimpleTest.Truth (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

If you see this output indicating your test passed, your GoogleTest is working correctly.

---

## 4. Validate Output and Success Criteria

- Test executable runs without errors or crashes.
- Console output shows tests running and passing as per the example above.
- No linker or runtime errors related to GoogleTest.

If you encounter failures:

- Verify compiler and linker flags.
- Confirm that correct library versions of GoogleTest are used.
- Check for missing dependencies such as threading libraries.

## 5. Quick Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors">
- Verify you included the GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers correctly.
- Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or newer.
- Make sure to link both `libgtest` and `libgtest_main`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linker Errors">
- Linking must include GoogleTest libraries; check paths.
- Ensure `-pthread` or equivalent threading flags are added on POSIX systems.
- On Windows, link against `gtest.lib` and `gtest_main.lib`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Executable Fails to Run or Crashes">
- Confirm all dependencies are met.
- Check that the test main function is included (usually from `libgtest_main`).
- Run with `--gtest_verbose=info` to get more debug output.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests Not Executed or Not Detected">
- Confirm test macros (`TEST()`) are used properly.
- Ensure tests are linked into the executable.
- Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` call to start tests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that your installation is validated:

- Proceed to [Writing and Running Your First Test](../first-test-experience/create-run-first-test) to begin defining meaningful tests.
- Review [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](../first-test-experience/common-issues-troubleshooting) for deeper help.
- Explore [Installation & Setup](../installation-setup/installation-methods) if you have not completed installation.

<Tip>
Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock together to write expressive, verifiable unit tests that catch mismatches early. Complement these validation steps by ensuring your development environment complies with all compiler and platform requirements.
