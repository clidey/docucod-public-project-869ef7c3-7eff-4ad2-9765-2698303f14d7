# Running the Sample Tests

This page guides you through running the sample test binaries provided by GoogleTest. Running these tests is the quickest and most reliable method to validate that your GoogleTest installation is functional and properly configured.

---

## 1. Locate the Sample Test Binaries

When you build GoogleTest, several sample test executables are produced. These binaries demonstrate typical usage and provide a ready-to-run test suite that confirms your build and installation are working correctly.

- If you built GoogleTest using CMake or another build system, the sample test binaries are located in the `googletest/samples` directory inside your build output folder.
- Common samples include `sample1_unittest`, `sample2_unittest`, up to `sample10_unittest`.


### How to find sample tests:

- Navigate to the root directory where you built GoogleTest.
- Go to `googletest/samples/` (or `googletest-build/samples/` if you keep builds separate).
- Look for executable files with names like `sample1_unittest`, `sample7_unittest.cc` (source), or other `*_unittest` binaries.

<Tip>
If you cannot find these binaries, double-check that the build finished successfully and the samples were included in your build configuration.
</Tip>

## 2. Running a Sample Test

Running a sample test executable runs dozens of tests verifying GoogleTest's core features and your build environment.

To run a sample test:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the sample executable, e.g., `cd googletest/samples`.
3. Execute the test binary. For example:

```bash
./sample1_unittest
```

On Windows, you may need to run:

```powershell
sample1_unittest.exe
```


### Expected Output

A typical run will produce output that looks like this:

<pre>
[==========] Running 5 tests from 2 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FooTest
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesAbc
[       OK ] FooTest.DoesAbc (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesXyz
[       OK ] FooTest.DoesXyz (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Bar
[       OK ] FooTest.Bar (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FooTest (0 ms total)
[----------] 2 tests from BarTest
[ RUN      ] BarTest.DoesAbc
[       OK ] BarTest.DoesAbc (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] BarTest.DoesXyz
[       OK ] BarTest.DoesXyz (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from BarTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 5 tests from 2 test suites ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 5 tests.
</pre>

The exact output depends on the sample test run but should always conclude with: `[  PASSED  ] X tests.`

<Tip>
Use the `--help` flag to display supported command line options and flags for controlling test execution and output formatting.

```bash
./sample1_unittest --help
```

</Tip>

## 3. Using Command-Line Flags with Sample Tests

GoogleTest test binaries support many flags to customize test runs.

Some useful flags to try with sample tests:

- `--gtest_list_tests` - Lists all tests without running them.
- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` - Runs only specific tests matching the filter.
- `--gtest_repeat=N` - Runs tests N times for flaky test detection.
- `--gtest_output=xml:filename.xml` - Generates XML report files.

Example:

```bash
./sample1_unittest --gtest_filter=FooTest.* --gtest_repeat=5
```

<Tip>
These flags give you insight into filtering, managing test runs, and generating results suitable for CI or dashboards.
</Tip>

## 4. Validating Your Installation

Successfully running and passing all tests in the sample executables indicates that:

- Your GoogleTest headers and libraries are correctly installed.
- Your build system properly links against GoogleTest.
- The runtime environment supports the expected functionality.

If the tests pass as expected, your installation is fully functional.

<Check>
Remember to check the return code of the test executable—`0` means success, anything else indicates failure. This is crucial for automated CI systems.
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

If sample tests fail to build or run, consider the following:

- Verify you are using a supported compiler with at least C++17 support.
- Check that the `gtest` or `gmock` libraries are properly built and linked.
- Ensure that runtime dependencies (e.g., pthread on Linux) are available.
- Look for platform-specific issues such as Windows runtime library conflicts.

For build failures, consult the respective installation guides:

- [Installing with CMake](/getting-started/installation-initialization/install-cmake)
- [Installing with Bazel](/getting-started/installation-initialization/install-bazel)

## 6. Next Steps

Once you have validated your GoogleTest installation by running the sample tests:

- Proceed to [Writing Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-experience/write-your-first-test) to start writing your own tests.
- Explore [Validating Your Setup](/getting-started/first-test-experience/validate-setup) for additional checks.
- Learn about [Integrating GoogleTest into Your Build System](/guides/integration-solutions/cmake-bazel-integration).
