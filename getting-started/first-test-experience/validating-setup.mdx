# Validating Your Setup

Quickly confirm that your GoogleTest installation and configuration are correct by running sample tests and verifying output for successful execution. This guide walks you through running built-in example tests, understanding test outcomes, troubleshooting early setup mistakes, and identifying success indicators for your testing environment.

---

## 1. Running Sample GoogleTest Executables

The best way to validate your GoogleTest setup is to build and run the example tests that come with the framework. This confirms that GoogleTest is correctly compiled, linked, and functioning on your platform.

### Steps to Run Sample Tests

1. **Locate or Build Test Executables**
   - If you followed the installation steps, you should have example test binaries like `googletest_samples`, `googletest_output_test` or similar available.
   - If not yet built, build the tests first using your chosen build system (CMake, Bazel, or manual build). Instructions are covered in the [Building and Running Tests](../first-test-experience/building-and-running-tests.md).

2. **Run the Test Executable**
   Execute the test binary in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```shell
   ./googletest_samples
   ```

3. **Observe the Output**
   - The output lists each test run with its status (`[  PASSED  ]`, `[  FAILED  ]`, `[  SKIPPED ]`).
   - At the end, summary lines show total tests run, passed, failed, and skipped.

4. **Verify Success**
   - A clean setup will show most tests passing and only some tests failing where failure is expected.
   - The final message: `PASSED` or `All tests passed` indicates a successful setup.

### Sample Output Snippet

```none
[==========] Running 90 tests from 43 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
...
[  PASSED  ] 31 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 57 tests, listed below:
...
[==========] 90 tests from 43 test suites ran. (total time)
[  PASSED  ] 31 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 57 tests.
Number of tests run: 90

PASS
```

> Note: Some tests may be designed to fail to demonstrate features (e.g., failure reporting).


## 2. Understanding Test Results

After running a sample test:

- **Passed tests** confirm GoogleTest's core assertion and execution are working.
- **Failed tests** in sample binaries may be intentional to test failure handling.
- **Skipped tests** indicate tests deliberately omitted (for example when `GTEST_SKIP()` is used).

Look out for common messages:

- `FAIL()` outputs indicate fatal failures.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` shows nonfatal failures.
- Tracebacks and failure logs help verify the assertion framework is correctly capturing errors.

## 3. Troubleshooting Early Setup Issues

If you encounter problems while running sample tests or during build:

### Common Issues and Fixes

- **GoogleTest Not Found or Header Missing**
  - Ensure the `gtest/gtest.h` header file is included in your project include path.
  - Follow [Installation Methods](../setup-and-installation/installation-methods.md) to correctly set up GoogleTest.

- **Linker Errors (Undefined References)**
  - Confirm that GoogleTest libraries are linked during compilation.
  - Building GoogleTest as a static or shared library and linking it is required.

- **Tests Not Running or 0 Tests Found**
  - Check test registration macros `TEST` and `TEST_F` are correctly used.
  - Ensure tests are not filtered out accidentally by `--gtest_filter` flags.

- **Assertion Macros Cause Compilation Errors**
  - Confirm you use `EXPECT_` or `ASSERT_` macros inside supported test bodies.
  - Do not place fatal assertion macros in non-void functions or constructors/destructors.

- **Runtime Issues**
  - Use `--gtest_list_tests` to list available tests and confirm test discovery.
  - Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to debug failing assertions interactively.

## 4. Key Indicators of a Successful Setup

Confirm the following to know your GoogleTest environment is ready:

- All sample tests compile and link without error.
- Test binaries run and produce informative output.
- At least some tests pass, demonstrating basic assertion and test lifecycle operation.
- The test runner displays summary counts: total tests, passed, failed, and skipped.
- Failure and success messages include line numbers, file names, and diagnostic info.

<Tip>
For new users, running the `googletest_output_test_` binary is especially useful as it covers a wide range of assertion cases and expected outputs.

## 5. Next Steps and Recommendations

After validating your setup:

- Explore writing your own simple tests as explained in [Writing Your First Test](../first-test-experience/hello-test.md).
- Learn how to organize tests using fixtures with [Test Fixtures](../primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests).
- Familiarize yourself with assertions via the [Assertions Reference](../reference/assertions.md).
- Practice running selective tests using `--gtest_filter` as detailed in the [Running Test Programs: Advanced Options](../advanced.md#running-test-programs-advanced-options).
- Consult the [Solving Common Setup Issues](../troubleshooting-and-faq/common-setup-issues.md) if you encounter problems.
