# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation and setup are working correctly with this checklist. Follow these steps to write and run a basic test, verify successful output, and troubleshoot common issues. This guide helps you confirm your toolchain is ready to provide reliable C++ testing.

---

## 1. Write a Basic Test

Begin with a simple test to verify the framework is functioning as expected.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A trivial test that always succeeds
TEST(SanityCheck, BasicAssertion) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

### Tips:
- Use the `TEST()` macro for simple, fixture-less tests.
- Avoid underscores (`_`) in test and test suite names to prevent naming conflicts (see [FAQ on underscores](../faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)).


## 2. Compile Your Test

Make sure to link against the GoogleTest libraries properly.

### Using CMake

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_test_target GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)
```

### Manual Compile Command Example

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include \
    -pthread your_test.cc /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a -o your_test
```

### Tips:
- Ensure C++17 or later is used as required by GoogleTest.
- Link both `gtest` and `gtest_main` if you rely on the default `main`.


## 3. Run the Test Binary

Execute the test program.

```bash
./your_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck
[ RUN      ] SanityCheck.BasicAssertion
[       OK ] SanityCheck.BasicAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

### Tips:
- This confirms that GoogleTest is installed and configured correctly.
- If you see errors, check include paths, linking, and runtime environment.


## 4. Verify Output and Interpretation

- `[ RUN ]` indicates a test is starting.
- `[       OK ]` shows that a test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ]` means a test failed. Review the messages printed below for cause.
- The summary shows the total number of tests run and their results.


## 5. Diagnose Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors Related to Missing Headers or Libraries">
Check that the compiler include path contains the `googletest/include` directory and linker paths include `libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a` (or respective shared libraries). Also ensure you compile with C++17 or later.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors About Undefined References">
Verify that you are linking both `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries. Remember you must link against the same build type (Debug/Release) as your test.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Missing Tests">
If no tests appear to run, check the naming rules: test suite and test names cannot contain underscores and must be valid C++ identifiers. Also ensure you have called `testing::InitGoogleTest()` in your `main()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Crashes or Unexpected Behavior">
Ensure your test code and fixtures themselves do not cause crashes. Use `EXPECT_` over `ASSERT_` to allow multiple failures per run. Review the document on [Death Tests](reference/assertions.md#death) if your tests intentionally crash.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 6. Next Steps

- Consult the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) to learn how to write more comprehensive tests.
- Explore the full [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) to understand all available assertion macros.
- Review [Writing and Running Your First Test](getting-started/first-test-experience/writing-first-test.md) for a guided tutorial.
- Use the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues.md) document to resolve setup hurdles.


## 7. Sample `main()` Function

If you write your own `main()`, follow this pattern:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);  // Parse command-line flags
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();                // Run all registered tests
}
```

Note: Avoid ignoring the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` as test result depends on it.


## 8. Useful Command-Line Flags During Early Adoption

- `--gtest_list_tests`

  Lists all tests without running them.

- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`

  Runs specific tests.

- `--gtest_color=yes|no|auto`

  Controls colored output.

<Tip>
Always ensure test names and suite names do NOT contain underscores to avoid subtle issues and conflicts.
