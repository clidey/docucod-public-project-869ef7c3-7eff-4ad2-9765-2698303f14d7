# Quick Validation & Sample Tests

Verify your GoogleTest installation immediately by running the pre-provided sample tests. This page guides you step-by-step through executing these tests and checking the expected outputs, helping confirm that your environment is correctly configured and ready for further development.

---

## 1. Ensure the GoogleTest Environment Is Ready

Before running any tests, confirm that:

- You have installed GoogleTest according to the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation-instructions).
- Your build system is configured appropriately as per [Configuration & Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup-basics/configuration-setup).
- You have access to the sample test source files included in the repository (e.g., in the `samples` directory).


<Check>
If any of these are incomplete, please visit the installation and configuration pages first.
</Check>


## 2. Locate and Build the Sample Tests

GoogleTest ships with example tests that exercise key framework functionality. Building these tests confirms that GoogleTest compiles and links successfully on your system.

### Steps

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the GoogleTest source code.
3. Build the samples. For example, if you use CMake:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Upon successful build, the sample test executables (e.g., `sample1_unittest`, `sample2_unittest`, etc.) will be created.

<Note>
If you are using Bazel or other build tools, refer to your build environment’s instructions on how to build these tests.
</Note>


## 3. Run the Sample Tests

After building, execute the sample tests to validate the GoogleTest framework.

### Run Tests

- From the build directory, run a sample test executable:

  ```bash
  ./sample1_unittest
  ```

- You should see console output similar to:

  ```
  [==========] Running 3 tests from 3 test suites.
  [----------] Global test environment set-up.
  [----------] 1 test from Sample1Test
  [ RUN      ] Sample1Test.DoesThis
  [       OK ] Sample1Test.DoesThis (0 ms)
  [----------] 1 test from Sample1Test (0 ms total)

  [----------] 1 test from Sample2Test
  [ RUN      ] Sample2Test.DoesThat
  [       OK ] Sample2Test.DoesThat (0 ms)
  [----------] 1 test from Sample2Test (0 ms total)

  [----------] 1 test from Sample3Test
  [ RUN      ] Sample3Test.DoesSomethingElse
  [       OK ] Sample3Test.DoesSomethingElse (0 ms)
  [----------] 1 test from Sample3Test (0 ms total)

  [----------] Global test environment tear-down
  [==========] 3 tests from 3 test suites ran. (1 ms total)
  [  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
  ```

### Interpret Results

- **Passed tests:** The `[  PASSED  ]` summary with zero failures indicates the installation and environment are correctly set up.
- **Failures or errors:** Any `[  FAILED  ]` messages indicate issues in setup or compilation. Review the error messages, verify your build environment, and consult the [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-help/troubleshooting-installation) guide.

<Warning>
If tests fail, check that your compiler meets the GoogleTest minimum requirements and that all dependencies are correctly installed.
</Warning>


## 4. Running Tests with Additional Flags

You can run tests with extra command-line flags to modify behavior or filter tests.

### Commonly Used Flags

- List all tests without running them:
  ```bash
  ./sample1_unittest --gtest_list_tests
  ```
- Run specific tests matching a pattern:
  ```bash
  ./sample1_unittest --gtest_filter=Sample1Test.*
  ```
- Repeat tests multiple times:
  ```bash
  ./sample1_unittest --gtest_repeat=10
  ```

For a full list of flags, run:

```bash
./sample1_unittest --help
```


## 5. Verify Test Output Programmatically

If your test runner or continuous integration system collects output,
you can verify if tests passed by confirming the main test runner’s exit code:

- Exit code `0` means all tests passed.
- Exit code non-zero indicates failures.

Sample invocation for scripting environments:

```bash
if ./sample1_unittest; then
  echo "GoogleTest sample tests passed successfully."
else
  echo "GoogleTest sample tests failed. Check logs for details."
fi
```


## 6. Next Steps

Once you have validated your GoogleTest installation:

- Start writing actual tests using the [Writing Your First Test guide](/getting-started/first-test-experience/write-first-test).
- Integrate GoogleTest into your project build process by following [Configuration & Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup-basics/configuration-setup).
- Explore advanced testing patterns and best practices in the [Core Testing Workflows](/guides/core-testing-workflows/writing-your-first-test) section.

## Troubleshooting Quick Validation

If you encounter issues running the sample tests:

- Check for common environment and dependency issues in [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-help/troubleshooting-installation).
- Confirm your C++ compiler supports C++17 or later, required by GoogleTest.
- Verify that all GoogleTest shared libraries are properly linked if using shared builds.
- Look for detailed messages in the test output indicating the nature of the failure.


<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Found or Not Running">
Ensure your build has included and linked the sample test sources correctly. Confirm no filtering flags exclude your tests when running.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors">
Confirm your compiler supports at least C++17 and all dependencies such as CMake or Bazel are the required versions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linking Errors">
Verify linking against `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries, especially when not using pre-built binaries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Failures in Samples">
Review the exact error messages. Sample tests should pass under normal conditions. Any failures indicate misconfiguration or environment problems.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
