# Troubleshooting and Common Setup Issues

When starting with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, encountering setup issues such as compilation errors, linkage problems, or test discovery failures can interrupt your progress. This guide equips you with immediate troubleshooting steps to diagnose and fix the most common issues so you can get your tests running smoothly and productively.

---

## 1. Compilation Errors

### Common Causes
- Missing or incorrect include directives
- Incorrect compiler standard (must support C++17 or higher)
- Conflicts with symbols or namespaces

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Verify Include Paths**
   - Ensure your code includes `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` and `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` as needed.
   - Confirm your build system points to the correct GoogleTest and GoogleMock include directories.

2. **Check Compiler Standard**
   - GoogleTest requires C++17 support.
   - If you see errors related to language features, confirm your compiler flags include `-std=c++17` (or equivalent).

3. **Examine Errors for Virtual Methods**
   - Mocked methods need to be `virtual` in the interface.
   - Non-virtual methods cannot be mocked directly. Use the high-performance dependency injection technique if you need to mock non-virtual methods (see related guides).

4. **Handle Overloads and Commas Carefully**
   - For mocked methods with arguments containing commas (e.g., templated types), wrap argument types in extra parentheses or use type aliases.

```cpp
// Example of wrapping complex type arguments
MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
```

### Best Practices
- Always declare mocked methods in the `public:` section.
- Use `override` specifier on mocked methods to catch signature mismatches early.

---

## 2. Linker Errors

### Common Causes
- Missing linkage to GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries.
- Conflicts with multiple definition of `main()`.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Link Against gtest and gmock Libraries**
   - Link your test executable with `gtest`, `gtest_main`, and `gmock` libraries, depending on your needs.

2. **Avoid Conflicting `main()` Definitions**
   - GoogleTest provides a ready-made `main()` in `gtest_main` and `gmock_main` libraries.
   - Link either against these or supply your own `main()` function properly set up to call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` or `testing::InitGoogleMock()` followed by `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

3. **Check Platform-Specific Linker Behaviors**
   - On Windows, watch for `wmain` vs `main` conflicts, especially with UNICODE builds.

---

## 3. Test Discovery Failures

### Common Causes
- Tests not registered due to macros misuse.
- Missing calls to test framework initialization.

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Use the Correct Macros**
   - Define tests using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`.
   - Ensure test fixtures inherit from `testing::Test`.

2. **Initialize the Framework**
   - Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` (or `testing::InitGoogleMock`) before running tests.

3. **Verify Test Registration**
   - If tests do not run, check that you do not exclude their compilation or link unit.

4. **Check Naming Conventions**
   - Test suite and test names should be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.

---

## 4. Common Runtime Issues

### Uninteresting Calls Warning
You may see warnings like:

```
Uninteresting mock function call - default action taken ...
```

**What it means:** A mock method was called without a matching `EXPECT_CALL`. This is informational and often expected.

**How to resolve:**
- If the call is intended, add an `EXPECT_CALL` with `.WillRepeatedly(...)` to suppress the warning.
- Adjust verbosity with the flag `--gmock_verbose=error|warning|info`.

### Failed Expectations
- Review expectation setup. Set `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces of mock calls.
- Use sequences or `.After()` clauses to enforce call order if needed.

---

## 5. Using gMock Verbosity Flags

To get more insight during troubleshooting, run your tests with:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This flag prints detailed traces of mock function calls and expectation matching.

You can also control verbosity programmatically:

```cpp
GMOCK_FLAG_SET(verbose, "info");
```

See [FlagTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/test/gmock_test.cc) in the repository for examples.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors">
### Symptoms
- Compiler errors related to missing headers or unknown types.
- Warnings about virtual destructor or incorrect MOCK_METHOD signatures.

### Solutions
- Confirm `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` and `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` are in your test files.
- Make sure your compiler supports C++17 or later and you enable it.
- Mocked methods must be declared `virtual` and public in the base class.
- Use `override` specifier on MOCK_METHOD declarations when possible.
- Wrap argument types containing commas with extra parentheses.

Example:
```cpp
MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<int, int>), GetPair, ());
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors">
### Symptoms
- Undefined symbols related to GoogleTest or GoogleMock.
- Multiple definition errors for `main()`.

### Solutions
- Link against the correct libraries: `gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, and/or `gmock_main`.
- Use `gtest_main` if you want to use GoogleTestâ€™s provided `main()`.
- If you provide your own `main()`, ensure it calls `testing::InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Check platform-specific linker quirks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Discovery Failures">
### Symptoms
- Tests don't run or are not discovered.

### Solutions
- Use `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros correctly.
- Confirm test fixtures inherit from `testing::Test`.
- Call `testing::InitGoogleTest` or `testing::InitGoogleMock` at program start.
- Avoid naming collisions and use valid test suite and test case names.
- Ensure tests are compiled and linked into your test executable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting Calls Warning">
### Symptoms
- Console logs warnings like "Uninteresting mock function call".

### Explanation
- The mock method was called without an expected call set.

### Solutions
- If the calls are expected but don't require checks, create an `EXPECT_CALL` with `.WillRepeatedly(...)` for that method.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=error` to suppress these warnings if they are noisy.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Failed Expectations and Mismatches">
### Symptoms
- Test failures due to unmet expectations.

### Solutions
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed call logs.
- Check arguments, call order, and invocation counts.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) or `After()` to specify call order.
- Inspect your mock action setup to ensure correct behavior.
</Accordion>
