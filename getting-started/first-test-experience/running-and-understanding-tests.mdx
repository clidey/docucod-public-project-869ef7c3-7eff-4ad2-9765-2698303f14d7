# Running and Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest simplifies running your test binaries and interpreting the results. This guide walks you through launching your tests, reading their standard output, understanding success and failure indicators, discovering tests automatically, and making sense of the detailed reports.

---

## 1. Running Your Test Binary

Your test suite compiles into a test binary that you run from the command line or integrated development environment. Running this binary executes all registered tests automatically.

### How to Run

```bash
/path/to/your/test_binary [FLAGS]
```

- Replace `/path/to/your/test_binary` with the actual path.
- Optional flags control test execution and verbosity.

#### Commonly Used Flags

| Flag                    | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter=pattern` | Run only tests matching the filter pattern.                   |
| `--gtest_repeat=N`      | Repeat the test N times for stability testing.                 |
| `--gtest_output=xml`    | Generate an XML report alongside console output.               |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure` | Break into the debugger on test failures (if supported).       |

<Tip>
To run all tests multiple times for detecting flaky behavior, use `--gtest_repeat=10`.
</Tip>

## 2. Test Discovery and Automatic Execution

When you build your test binary with GoogleTest, the framework automatically discovers all tests declared with `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and typed tests macros.

There is no need to register tests manually. `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` will execute all discovered tests in your binary.

### What Happens When You Run the Binary

1. GoogleTest parses your command-line flags.
2. It initializes internal structures, enumerating all registered tests.
3. Executes each test in isolation.
4. Reports results for each test.

<Note>
Tests are run sequentially by default. Parallel execution requires external orchestration.
</Note>

## 3. Interpreting Standard Output

GoogleTestâ€™s console output clearly indicates which tests passed, failed, or were skipped.

### Sample Output

```shell
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.ThrowsOnNegative
[       OK ] FactorialTest.ThrowsOnNegative (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

### What to Look For

- `[ RUN      ]` indicates a test started.
- `[       OK ]` signals success.
- `[  FAILED  ]` signals failure.
- Summary section at the end shows total tests run and number passed/failed.

### Detailed Failure Messages

When a test fails, GoogleTest outputs the failing assertion location, failure message, and, if enabled, stack traces and custom messages.

Example:

```shell
path/to/test_file.cc:42: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(2)
    Which is: 3
  2
```

<Tip>
Use the file and line number printed to jump straight to the cause of the failure.
</Tip>

### Skipped Tests

If you mark tests as disabled (by prefixing with `DISABLED_`), they are omitted from the run.

You will see entries like:

```shell
[  SKIPPED ] SomeOtherTest.TestName
```

## 4. Understanding Pass/Fail Criteria

### What Constitutes a Test Failure?

- Any failed assertion (`ASSERT_*` or `EXPECT_*` returning failure).
- Unexpected exceptions or crashes during the test.
- Test timeouts, if enforced externally.

### Fatal vs. Nonfatal Failures

- `ASSERT_*` macros cause immediate test termination.
- `EXPECT_*` macros log failures but continue running, enabling multiple failures per test.

GoogleTest aggregates all test failures and reports the result at the end.

<Note>
Test failures stop the current test but do not stop the overall test sequence unless you configure it to do so.
</Note>

## 5. Detailed Test Output and Reporting Features

### XML and Other Output Formats

Use `--gtest_output=xml:[path]` to generate XML reports compatible with many CI systems.

Example:

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

This produces `report.xml` capturing detailed test outcomes.

### Verbosity Control

Change verbosity with `--gtest_verbose=level`:

| Level    | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `info`   | Includes info, warnings, errors |
| `warning`| Warnings and errors (default) |
| `error`  | Errors only                  |

Verbose output helps debug unexpected or uninteresting calls.

### Filtering Tests

Use `--gtest_filter` to run subsets:

```bash
--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.*  # all tests in a suite
--gtest_filter=-TestSuiteName.* # all tests except these in a suite
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Test Output

### Common Issues

- **No tests run:** Confirm tests are registered using `TEST()`, linked correctly, and that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called.
- **Unexpected failures:** Verify failing assertions in the output, ensure test environment is correctly configured.
- **Tests skipped unintentionally:** Check test name prefixes (e.g., `DISABLED_` disables the test).

### Debugging Tips

- Use the line number in failure messages to navigate directly to code.
- Increase verbosity with `--gtest_verbose=info` for more details.
- Run tests individually using filters for isolating failures.

<Tip>
Enable XML output and feed it to your CI or reporting tools for automated tracking.
</Tip>
