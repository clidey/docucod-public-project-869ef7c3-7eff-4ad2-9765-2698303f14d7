# Exploring Sample Tests

This page showcases existing sample test files that demonstrate both GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage. If you're new to these frameworks, exploring and experimenting with these samples will deepen your understanding of writing effective tests in C++.

---

## Overview of Sample Tests

The GoogleTest repository includes a rich set of sample test files covering a wide spectrum of testing features from simple assertions to advanced mocking techniques. These samples serve as practical, hands-on examples illustrating how to integrate and leverage GoogleTest and GoogleMock capabilities.

These sample tests are located within the `googletest/samples` directory of the source repository and include both plain GoogleTest tests and those incorporating GoogleMock for mock object usage.

---

## Why Explore The Samples?

Exploring sample tests helps you:

- Understand how to structure your test files.
- Learn usage patterns of various test macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, typed tests, and more.
- Experiment with test fixtures to reuse test setups.
- See practical examples of value-parameterized and type-parameterized tests.
- Gain insight into GoogleMock's declarative mock definitions and expectations.
- Observe best practices and common idioms used within the framework.

Modifying these samples to run your own experiments can accelerate your learning and reduce the time needed to write your first comprehensive tests.

## Summary of Sample Files

The sample tests are numbered with comments describing their focus:

| Sample Number | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sample #1     | Basic steps of using GoogleTest to test C++ functions.                                            |
| Sample #2     | More complex unit test for a class with multiple member functions.                               |
| Sample #3     | Usage of test fixtures (`TEST_F`).                                                               |
| Sample #4     | Combining Googletest and `gtest/gtest.h` to leverage full features.                              |
| Sample #5     | Sharing common test logic in a base test fixture and reusing it with derived test fixtures.      |
| Sample #6     | Demonstrates type-parameterized tests.                                                           |
| Sample #7     | Shows the basics of value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`)                                         |
| Sample #8     | Illustrates using `Combine()` with value-parameterized tests for multi-parameter scenarios.      |
| Sample #9     | Shows how to use GoogleTest’s listener API to modify console output and use reflection API.      |
| Sample #10    | Uses listener API to implement a simple memory leak checker in tests.                            |

Each sample includes clear, well-commented code to guide you through specific GoogleTest and GoogleMock features.

## How to Use These Samples

### Step 1: Locate the Samples

The official samples are found in the `googletest/samples` folder of the repository.

### Step 2: Build with Your Project

You can include these samples directly to understand build configurations and compile them using your existing CMake or build system setup.

### Step 3: Run and Modify

Run the samples to observe their behavior. Modify test cases or add new tests within these structures to explore different assertions and mocking behaviors.

### Step 4: Use Samples As Templates

Use the sample files as templates for writing your own tests. Adopting their style and structure will accelerate the integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock in your projects.

## Tips for Exploring Sample Tests

- **Focus on one sample at a time**: Since each sample targets a specific feature or use-case, isolate your exploration to one area before moving deeper.
- **Read comments carefully**: Samples include detailed comments explaining intent and special behaviors.
- **Modify expected outputs**: Change assertions deliberately to see how failures are reported.
- **Combine features gradually**: Start with simple tests (Sample #1) before exploring parameterized or typed tests.
- **Explore Mock examples**: Samples involving GoogleMock illustrate defining mock classes, expectations, and verifications — invaluable for understanding mocking.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when using or compiling sample tests, ensure:

- Your build environment meets the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](getting-started/setup-introduction/prerequisites.md).
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are correctly fetched and linked.
- You have configured your build tool (e.g., CMake) correctly as per [Quickstart: Building with CMake](quickstart-cmake.md).

Refer to the [Common Installation Problems](getting-started/troubleshooting/common-problems.md) if needed.
