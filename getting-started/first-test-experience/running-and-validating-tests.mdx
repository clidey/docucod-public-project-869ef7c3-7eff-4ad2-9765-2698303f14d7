# Running & Validating Tests with GoogleTest

This guide walks you through compiling, running, and interpreting your GoogleTest test suite's output. It ensures you can verify your tests execute successfully and understand typical results from both command-line and IDE workflows.

---

## 1. Compiling Your Test Suite

### Prerequisites
- Complete the installation and configuration of GoogleTest in your project. Refer to the [Configuration & Verification Guide](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/configuration-verification) for instructions on properly linking and including headers.
- Ensure your build environment supports C++17 or later, as required by GoogleTest.

### Compile Command Example
Depending on your build system, compile your test sources linking with GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries:

```bash
# Example using g++ with GoogleTest installed in /usr/local
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /usr/local/include -pthread \
    path/to/your_tests.cc \
    -L/usr/local/lib -lgtest -lgmock -lgtest_main -lgmock_main -o your_test_suite
```

<Tip>
Adjust the include and library paths according to your setup. For Bazel builds, follow your workspace configuration to include `//external:googletest`.
</Tip>

### Build Verification
- A successful compile should produce an executable (e.g., `your_test_suite`) without errors.
- Refer to [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements) if you encounter compiler or linking issues.

## 2. Running the Test Suite

Run your tests by executing the compiled binary:

```bash
./your_test_suite
```

### What to Expect
- The output begins with a test summary header from GoogleTest.
- Each test case will show as `PASSED` or `FAILED` along with detailed failure messages.

### Running Tests with Flags
GoogleTest supports command-line flags to control the test run:

- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` to run specific tests.
- `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times.
- `--gmock_verbose=LEVEL` (`info`, `warning`, `error`) to control GoogleMock output verbosity.

### Example
```shell
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

<Tip>
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get a detailed tracing of mock calls, which is helpful when debugging test failures.
</Tip>

## 3. Interpreting Test Output

GoogleTest's output is straightforward:

- **[  PASSED  ]**: Test passed successfully.
- **[  FAILED  ]**: Test failed due to a failed assertion or crash.
- Details after failures include the file name and line number.

GoogleMock will automatically verify that all expectations on mock objects are met when tests finish. Failures related to mocks will include messages describing violated expectations or unexpected calls.

### Common Output Sections

- `RUN      `: Indicates the test that is currently running.
- `PASSED` or `FAILED`: Shows the result per test.
- Summary at the end showing total tests run, passed, and failed.

### Common Failure Scenarios

- Assertions failed (`EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.) within tests.
- Mock expectation failures:
  - Calls not made the expected number of times.
  - Calls with unexpected arguments.
  - Call ordering violations when sequences are specified.

<Tip>
Pay close attention to the error messages and stack trace provided to diagnose test failures effectively.
</Tip>

## 4. Running Tests in IDEs

Most popular IDEs support running GoogleTest-based tests seamlessly.

### Setup
- Configure your IDE build settings to compile and link against GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Use provided launch configurations to execute tests.

### Viewing Results
- IDE-integrated test runners will show the test progress, success, and failures with clickable links to source lines.
- Follow the IDE's guidance on re-running failed tests or debugging.

### Example (Visual Studio / CLion)
- Build your test executable.
- Run the test binary via the IDE test explorer or directly.
- View detailed test result reports.

<Tip>
IDE integration enhances debugging speed by linking failures directly to the source code.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Always build your test binary with debug symbols during development.
- Run tests frequently to catch errors early.
- Use `EXPECT_` assertions for non-fatal checks to get more coverage per run.
- When using mocks:
  - Set expectations **before** exercising the code.
  - Use sequences to enforce call order if necessary.
  - Use `ON_CALL` to specify default mock behavior without expectations.
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug complex mock interactions.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Test Run Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Test binary fails to compile or link">
Make sure GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are correctly linked.
Check include paths and compiler compatibility.
Verify C++17 or later is enabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test runs but reports no tests executed">
Ensure your test functions are defined with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
Make sure your test suite is properly registered.
Verify main() calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and initializes GoogleTest correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test failures with confusing messages">
Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs.
Check if mock expectations have been set before method calls.
Use GoogleTest assertions to pinpoint failing conditions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected mock function call errors">
Verify that you defined the right expectations with correct matchers.
Add catch-all expectations like `EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` if needed.
Suppress warnings using `NiceMock` only when appropriate.

## 7. Next Steps

- After confirming your tests run successfully, proceed to [Writing Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-experience/writing-your-first-test).
- Learn about advanced test validation and mocking techniques in [Mocking APIs](/api-reference/mocking-apis/mock-classes-methods).
- Explore [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](/getting-started/first-test-experience/troubleshooting-and-common-issues) for solutions to frequent problems.

## Example Minimal Test Run Workflow

1. Compile test with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I<gtest_include_dir> -pthread \
    my_test.cc -L<gtest_lib_dir> -lgtest -lgmock -lgtest_main -lgmock_main -o my_test
```

2. Run:

```bash
./my_test
```

3. Expect output like:

```text
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.Basic
[       OK ] SampleTest.Basic (0 ms)
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
This simple example confirms GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly set up.
