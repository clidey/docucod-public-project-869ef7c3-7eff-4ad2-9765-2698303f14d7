# Validating Your Setup

Welcome to the crucial step of making sure your GoogleTest environment is correctly installed and ready to run your tests. This guide offers you quick commands and tips to confirm that your build and test runner setup is working as expected. You'll also learn how to interpret the typical outputs from build and test executions, so you can identify success or diagnose issues early in your testing workflow.

---

## 1. Confirming Your Build

### Step 1: Verify Compilation Success

After building GoogleTest following your preferred method (e.g., CMake or Bazel), the first task is to ensure the build completed without errors:

- **CMake Build:**
  - Run `cmake` and then `make` inside your build directory.
  - You should see output indicating successful compilation of `libgtest.a`, `libgmock.a`, and test binaries.

- **Bazel Build:**
  - Run `bazel test ...` to build and test all targets.
  - The output will show test progress with timestamps and log warnings or errors if any.

#### Expected Outcome
Youâ€™ll see messages like:
```
[ 100%] Built target gtest
[ 100%] Built target gmock
[100%] Built target gtest_main
[100%] Built target all
```
or for Bazel:
```
INFO: Build completed successfully
INFO: All tests passed
```

### Step 2: Run Built-in Sample Tests

GoogleTest ships with sample tests that demonstrate basic functionalities. Running these sample tests confirms both the build and runtime are functioning.

- Run the sample test executable (typically named `sampleX_unittest` or similar).
- You should see output like:
```
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[----------] 3 tests from SampleTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

#### Success Criteria
- All tests report `OK`
- No build or runtime errors

## 2. Validating the Test Runner

### Step 1: Initialize GoogleTest Properly

Before running tests, ensure your test program calls `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` in your `main()` function. This initializes the framework flags and sets up GoogleTest for test discovery.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

#### Common Pitfall
- Omitting `InitGoogleTest()` causes tests to not run properly.
- The framework outputs a clear warning if this is missed.

### Step 2: Run Your Tests

Execute your test binary:

```
./your_test_binary
```

### Step 3: Interpret Output

GoogleTest outputs test progress in a structured format:

- `[==========]` indicates overall progress.
- `[ RUN      ]` marks the start of a test.
- `[       OK ]` indicates test success.
- `[  FAILED  ]` indicates test failure.

#### Sample Output
```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesBar
[       OK ] FooTest.DoesBar
[ RUN      ] FooTest.DoesBaz
your_test.cc:42: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  1
  2
[  FAILED  ] FooTest.DoesBaz
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FooTest.DoesBaz
```

### Step 4: Check Exit Code

Verify the test program exits with `0` on success, or nonzero if tests failed. This ensures tools and CI systems accurately detect test status.

## 3. Tips for Interpreting Build and Test Output

### Understanding Test Failures

- Failure messages give the file and line number, explaining the assertion that failed.
- Output includes the expected and actual values.
- Stack traces may be included for deeper debugging.

### Using Verbose Output

- For CMake tests, you can run `ctest --output-on-failure` to see detailed failure logs.
- Bazel inherently displays errors on test failures with `--test_output=errors`.

### Common Output Patterns

| Output Message                  | Meaning                                  | Action                           |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `[       OK ]`                 | Test passed successfully                  | Nothing                          |
| `[  FAILED  ]`                | Test failed assertion(s)                  | Review failure message and fix    |
| `[  SKIPPED ]`                | Test skipped (e.g., via `GTEST_SKIP()` ) | Confirm if intentional or fix     |
| `**** FAILURE` in build logs  | Compilation or linking errors             | Review errors, dependencies      |
| Warning: No tests found        | Test discovery issue                      | Check test registration macros   |

## 4. Quick Commands Summary

```bash
# Build with CMake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -Dgtest_build_tests=ON
make -j$(nproc)
# Run tests, showing full output on failure
ctest --output-on-failure

# Build and test with Bazel
bazel test ... --test_output=errors

# Run your test executable
./your_test_binary

# Run with all tests, passing command line flags to GoogleTest
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=*  --gtest_repeat=1 --gtest_break_on_failure
```

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<Tip>
If your test runner outputs "IMPORTANT NOTICE" about missing `InitGoogleTest()`, double-check your `main()` function initialization.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If tests are not discovered or are all skipped, ensure:

- Tests are correctly registered via `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Your test executable is correctly linked with the test sources.
- Filters are not excluding all tests (check `--gtest_filter`).
</Warning>

<Note>
If you encounter build errors related to missing headers or libraries, verify your build environment includes GoogleTest source and headers and that compiler flags specify C++17 support.
</Note>

## 6. Affirming Your Setup is Valid

Once your tests run and produce outputs confirming test runs (pass or fail), you have validation that your build and runner are set up correctly.

For further exploration and confidence,

- Consider running the GoogleTest sample tests inside the `googletest/samples` directory.
- Try writing and running your own minimal test suite using `TEST()` macros.
