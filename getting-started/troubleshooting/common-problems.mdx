# Common Installation Problems

This page lists and explains the most frequent issues users encounter during the installation or first build of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, along with concrete solutions and diagnostic techniques. Use this guide as your troubleshooting companion to quickly resolve common blockers and get your environment running smoothly.

---

## 1. Build System Integration Problems

### Symptom
- Build system cannot find GoogleTest or GoogleMock headers and libraries.
- Errors like `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory` or linker errors.

### Causes & Solutions
- **GoogleTest/GoogleMock not installed or not correctly added to your build system dependencies.**
  - Ensure you have cloned the GoogleTest repository including submodules, or have installed the libraries properly.
  - If using CMake, confirm you correctly find and link `gtest` and `gmock` targets.
  - For Bazel, ensure your WORKSPACE and BUILD files include required dependencies.

- **Incorrect include or library paths.**
  - Verify your include directories contain paths like `googletest/include`.
  - Make sure your linker paths point to the directory containing the built libraries.

- **Mismatched build configurations (e.g. Debug vs Release).**
  - Rebuild GoogleTest and your tests with matching configurations.

### Diagnostic Tips
- Check that headers exist at the expected include path.
- Use verbose build output (`make VERBOSE=1` or `cmake --build . --verbose`) to inspect include and linker flags.
- Run minimal test compilation as described in [Verifying Installation & Configuration](../installation-guide/configuration-validation.md).

---

## 2. Compiler Version or Language Standard Issues

### Symptom
- Errors about unsupported language features or C++ standard.
- Compilation failures indicating missing standard library functions or symbol resolution errors.

### Causes & Solutions
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock require at least **C++17 standard** support.
- Supported compilers include GCC 7.4+, Clang 5.0+, MSVC 2017+.

- Ensure that your compiler invocation includes the correct standard flag, e.g.: 
  ```bash
  -std=c++17
  ```

- Upgrade your compiler if it does not support C++17.
- Consult the [Supported Platforms & Compilers](../setup-introduction/platforms.md) page for detailed compatibility information.

---

## 3. Incomplete Initialization or Missing Library Linking

### Symptom
- Linker errors like `undefined reference to InitGoogleMock` or missing test runner symbols.
- Runtime errors from improper flag parsing or initialization.

### Causes & Solutions
- Always call `InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv)` in your test program before running tests.

- Verify that the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are linked into your test executable.

- When using your own `main()`, ensure your test runner looks like:

  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

- Verify linkage by compiling and linking a minimal test as described in [Verifying Installation & Configuration](../installation-guide/configuration-validation.md).

---

## 4. Multiple or Conflicting Test Suite Definitions

### Symptom
- Running tests fails with messages such as:
  
  "All tests in the same test suite must use the same test fixture class..."

- Tests not discovered or conflicting with others unexpectedly.

### Causes & Solutions
- Ensure that all tests within the same test suite use the same fixture class.
- Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros in the same suite.
- Rename test fixtures or test suites to avoid name collisions across namespaces or translation units.

- See [Core Concepts & Terminology](../../overview/introduction-core/core-concepts-terminology.md) for proper test case and fixture usage.

---

## 5. Disabled Tests Behaving Confusingly

### Symptom
- Tests marked with `DISABLED_` prefix do not run, or tests expected to run do not execute.

### Causes & Solutions
- Prefixing a test or test suite with `DISABLED_` intentionally disables it.
- To run disabled tests, pass the flag `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` to your test executable.
- Confirm that the disabled naming pattern is intentional and not a typo.

---

## 6. Flaky or Hanging Death Tests

### Symptom
- Death tests appear to hang or run forever.
- Death tests report unexpected failures or pass unexpectedly.

### Causes & Solutions
- Make sure death tests are correctly specified, including matching expected error messages or exit codes.
- Follow the naming convention for death test suites ending with `DeathTest`.
- Consider the `death_test_style` flag, which defaults to "fast" but can be set to "threadsafe" for more reliable execution on multithreaded programs.
- Check for resource leaks and other issues that could hang subprocesses.

- See [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](../../docs/advanced.md#death-tests) for death test best practices.

---

## 7. Warning and Error Messages from GoogleMock

### Symptom
- Warnings like "Uninteresting mock function call" or errors about unexpected calls.

### Causes & Solutions
- Uninteresting calls happen when a mock method without `EXPECT_CALL` is invoked.
- If this is expected and acceptable, use `NiceMock<MockClass>` to suppress warnings.
- Unexpected calls mean an invocation did not match any `EXPECT_CALL`.
  - Verify your expectations and argument matchers.
  - Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get detailed tracing of mock calls and matched expectations.
- Use `ON_CALL()` to specify default behavior for mock methods.

- See [gMock Cookbook](../../docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for detailed mocking usage.

---

## 8. Test Not Running or No Tests Discovered

### Symptom
- The test executable runs but reports "No tests found" or skips all tests.

### Causes & Solutions
- Ensure that your test code includes at least one test defined with `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, or `TYPED_TEST()` macros.
- If using parameterized or typed tests, confirm you have instantiated the tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` or registered them with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to verify what tests are discovered.
- Ensure that test compilation and linking includes all test files.

---

## 9. Common Diagnostic Techniques

- Run your test binary with `--gtest_list_tests` to list all discovered tests.
- Use `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` to target specific tests.
- Enable verbose output with `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug mock call matching.
- Capture build and link commands for detailed examination.
- Try running sample tests from `googletest/samples` to verify your setup.
