# Getting Started FAQs

Welcome to the GoogleTest Getting Started FAQ. This concise guide addresses common questions and setup issues that early users frequently encounter. It is designed to help you swiftly resolve obstacles and smoothly begin writing and running tests with GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Naming Tests: Why Avoid Underscores in Test Suite and Test Names?

GoogleTest uses underscores (`_`) internally for special keywords and code generation. Using underscores in your `TestSuiteName` or `TestName` can cause subtle compilation or runtime issues.

- Avoid starting or ending your test suite or test names with an underscore.
- Avoid using underscores anywhere in the names to prevent conflicting generated class names.

**Example to avoid:**

```cpp
TEST(Time_Flies, Like_An_Arrow) { ... }
```

This can cause two different tests to generate the *same* class name, leading to failures.

**Best Practice:** Use camel case or simple naming without underscores to ensure compatibility and future-proofing.

<Note>
Although you may not see immediate issues, violating this naming convention risks breaking your tests with new compiler versions or future GoogleTest releases.
</Note>

## 2. Why Does GoogleTest Support `EXPECT_EQ(NULL, ptr)` but Not `EXPECT_NE(NULL, ptr)`?

- The preferred style is to use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` because it avoids type issues.
- Support for `EXPECT_EQ(NULL, ptr)` exists for historical reasons and common usage.
- `EXPECT_NE(NULL, ptr)` is not supported to reduce template complexity.

**Recommended usage:**

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(ptr, nullptr);
EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr);
```

Or for pointer non-null checks:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(ptr != nullptr);
```

If you need more expressive checks, consider using GoogleMock’s matcher syntax:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(ptr, ::testing::Not(nullptr));
```

---

## 3. Choosing Between Typed Tests and Value-Parameterized Tests for Interface Implementations

If you need to verify multiple implementations against common requirements:

- **Typed Tests:** Use when all implementations can be created the same way by type (e.g., default constructor).
- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Use when construction or initialization code differs significantly across implementations.

Benefits:
- Typed tests offer clearer failure output with type names.
- Value-parameterized tests give flexibility when instance creation varies.

<Advice>
Try both approaches to see which suits your needs. Practical experimentation clarifies subtle differences.
</Advice>

---

## 4. Why Do Death Tests Seem to Lose State Changes?

Death tests run in a separate child process to isolate expected crashes:

- Any side effects or state changes within a death test do *not* propagate back to the parent process.
- If you use mocks, EXPECT_CALL statements should be inside the `EXPECT_DEATH` block to be effective.

<Warning>
Place all necessary mock expectations and setup inside death test macros to avoid misleading results.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Common Linker Error: "Undefined References" to Static Const Members

If you declare:

```cpp
class Foo {
  static const int kBar = 100;
};
```

You also must define `kBar` in a source file:

```cpp
const int Foo::kBar;  // No initializer here.
```

**Exception:** If declared `constexpr`, this inline definition is sufficient.

---

## 6. Can You Derive Test Fixtures from Other Fixtures?

Yes. This is a powerful way to reuse test setup logic.

- Define a base fixture class inheriting from `::testing::Test`.
- Derive subclasses for specific test suites.
- Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` as needed, remembering to call base class implementations.

```cpp
class BaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Base setup
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Base teardown
  }
};

class FooTest : public BaseTest {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    BaseTest::SetUp();
    // More setup
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
    BaseTest::TearDown();
  }
};

TEST_F(FooTest, Example) {
  // Test code
}
```

For examples, see the [sample5_unittest.cc](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/samples/sample5_unittest.cc).

---

## 7. Constructor vs. SetUp() / Destructor vs. TearDown(): When to Use What?

GoogleTest creates a new test fixture object per test, calling `SetUp()` before each test and `TearDown()` after.

- **Use Constructor/Destructor:** For simple, non-failing initialization and cleanup—allows member variables to be `const`.
- **Use SetUp()/TearDown():** For operations that may fail, contain assertions, require virtual dispatch, or throw exceptions.

<Warning>
Do not place `ASSERT_*` macros inside constructors or destructors; these do not work correctly there.
</Warning>

---

## 8. Common Error: "No Matching Function for Call to TestFixture::TestFixture()"

GoogleTest requires default constructors for your test fixtures.

If your fixture declares non-default constructors or has const non-static members:

- Define an explicit default constructor.
- Initialize const members in the constructor initializer list.

Without this, your tests will not compile.

---

## 9. How to Temporarily Disable a Test?

Add the prefix `DISABLED_` to the test name:

```cpp
TEST(Foo, DISABLED_Bar) { ... }
```

Disabled tests are compiled but skipped during execution.

To run disabled tests:

```shell
./your_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

---

## 10. Why Is GoogleTest Output Mixed with Logging Messages?

GoogleTest outputs to **stdout** while most logging goes to **stderr**.

Separate them by redirecting output:

```shell
./my_test > gtest_output.txt
```

This keeps the test output clean and allows you to independently collect logs.

---

## 11. Why Are Test Fixtures Preferred Over Global Variables?

- Fixtures isolate test data, preventing state leakage between tests.
- Avoids polluting the global namespace.
- Supports subclassing and reuse more effectively.

---

## 12. Why Must the Entire Test Suite be Named `*DeathTest` When Using `ASSERT_DEATH`?

GoogleTest runs tests within a test suite sequentially and sets up/tears down once per suite.

Mixing death and non-death tests in the same suite leads to ordering conflicts and inefficiencies.

Best practice:

- Use separate test suites/classes for death tests by naming them with the `*DeathTest` suffix.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {};
class FooDeathTest : public FooTest {};
```

---

## 13. I See Compiler Errors Related to `ASSERT_PRED*`. What to Do?

Refer to [EXPECT_PRED* details](reference/assertions.md#EXPECT_PRED) in the Assertions Reference for correct usage and requirements.

---

## 14. Why Should I Use the Return Value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`?

Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()` function. Ignoring it leads to tests appearing successful even if failures occurred.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Some compilers enforce this by generating errors if the return value is ignored.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Early-User Issues">
<Accordion title="SetUp() Not Called">
Check that you spelled it exactly `SetUp()`. It is case-sensitive and must be spelled correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Undefined References to Static Const Members">
Ensure static const variables are defined outside the class if not declared `constexpr`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Death Test Hangs or Crashes">
Minimize threading in death tests and consider using the "threadsafe" death test style.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Output Is Hard to Read Due to Logging">
Redirect output to separate files, remember GoogleTest uses stdout and logs go to stderr.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors Using ASSERT_ in Constructor or Destructor">
Move assertions to `SetUp()` / `TearDown()`, as constructors and destructors don't allow them.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
