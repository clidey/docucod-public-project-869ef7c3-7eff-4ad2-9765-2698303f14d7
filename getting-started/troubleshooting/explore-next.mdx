## Advance Your Mocking Skills with the gMock Cookbook

The gMock Cookbook is your go-to collection of practical recipes and expert tips for writing powerful, maintainable mocks. It complements the foundational guides by illustrating advanced mocking concepts, best practices, and techniques to handle real-world testing scenarios efficiently.

### Highlights:
- Defining complex mock behaviors
- Dealing with overloaded and template methods
- Delegating calls and mocking move-only types
- Custom matchers and actions
- Expectation ordering & sequences
- Handling uninteresting vs unexpected calls

### How to Use:
- Read recipes tailored to your needs or test challenges
- Combine simple and complex examples for real project adaptations
- Use it as a reference while writing or refactoring tests

## Reference Key Mocking Facilities in the Mocking Reference

For a detailed and authoritative listing of all mocking macros, classes, and techniques provided by GoogleTest, consult the Mocking Reference. This reference is an indispensable companion when working with:

- The `MOCK_METHOD` macro syntax and qualifiers
- `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` usage with modifiers like `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.InSequence()`
- Mock object types: `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`
- Expectation sequencing and ordering
- Default value customizations

This guide is ideal for quick lookups, syntax clarification, and understanding the fine points of mocking API conventions.
