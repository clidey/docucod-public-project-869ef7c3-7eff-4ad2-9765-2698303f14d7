# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the necessary compilers, platforms, and build tools to successfully build and run GoogleTest. This page guides you through the critical requirements, helping you prepare your setup for seamless integration and usage.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standards

- GoogleTest requires a compiler supporting **C++17 or later**.
- Ensure your build system enforces at least C++17:
  - In CMake, set:
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```
  - For non-CMake environments, verify compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` (GCC/Clang) or appropriate Visual Studio project settings.

<Note>
GoogleTest will fail to build if your compiler does not meet C++17 standards. Always verify your build system setup before proceeding.
</Note>


## 2. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest aims to support a broad range of operating systems and follows Google's foundational C++ support policy. Supported platforms include, but are not limited to:

- **Linux** (including Android)
- **Windows** Desktop and MinGW
- **Mac OS X** and **iOS**
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX**
- Various BSD and UNIX derivatives

<Info>
Although major platforms are well supported, some niche or embedded platforms may face instability. If you work on less common systems, testing your environment early is crucial.
</Info>


## 3. Required Compilers

Ensure your compiler version aligns with the following minimum thresholds:

| Compiler         | Minimum Version | Notes                                       |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| GCC              | 7.0 or later    | Full C++17 support and feature macros       |
| Clang            | 3.8 or later    | Supports C++17 standards and modern features|
| MSVC (Visual C++) | Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 19.11) or later | Must support C++17 and have `__has_include` support|

<Tip>
For MSVC, at least Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 is recommended for GoogleTest compatibility. Visual Studio 2017 and newer fully support required features.
</Tip>


## 4. Threading and Synchronization Support

- GoogleTest uses threading to run tests concurrently.
- Thread-safety depends on the platform's threading library support:
  - **POSIX threads (pthread)** on Linux, Mac OS X, BSD
  - **Windows threading APIs** on Windows

<Check>
If your platform does not have pthreads or Windows threading support, some GoogleTest features may be disabled or unstable. You can verify thread support with the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` after including `<gtest/gtest.h>`.
</Check>


## 5. Build Tools and Dependencies

- **CMake** (recommended): Version 3.5 or later for best build experience.
- **pkg-config**: Useful for build systems to automatically discover compiler and linker flags.
- **Optional dependencies** (for internal GoogleTest features):
  - RE2 regular expression library (used if available)
  - Abseil libraries (if GoogleTest is built with Abseil support)

<Note>
Most standard environments will not need special action here. If you have a custom setup, ensure build tools are correctly installed and in your system path.
</Note>


## 6. Compiler Flags and Customization Macros

GoogleTest can be adjusted at build time with specific macros to enable or disable features:

- **Exception Support**: Enable with `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=1`, disable with `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` as per your compiler capabilities.
- **RTTI**: Enable/disable with `-DGTEST_HAS_RTTI=1` or `0`.
- **Threading**: Override pthread detection with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`.
- **Shared Library Builds**:
  - Compile GoogleTest as shared library with `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.
  - Compile tests that link to shared GoogleTest with `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

<Warning>
Misconfiguring these macros may cause build failures or runtime issues. Only change them if you know your environment deviates from auto-detection.
</Warning>


## 7. Runtime Environment Considerations

- GoogleTest expects a modern filesystem; some embedded or restricted platforms without filesystem support may restrict full functionality.
- Stream redirection, which is used internally by GoogleTest for output capturing, requires OS support (usually present except on mobile/embedded OSes).


## 8. Verifying Your Environment

After setting up your environment:

1. Check your compiler version with `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or Visual Studio IDE.
2. Verify `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` is set to 17 or higher for your project.
3. Confirm threading support (e.g., presence of pthread) is available.
4. Try building GoogleTest following [Build and Install from Source](../../getting-started/installation-config/build-from-source).

<Tip>
For step-by-step build instructions and environment verification commands, see the related Installation pages.
</Tip>


## 9. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Related to System Requirements">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
If your compiler is outdated:

- Update to a supported version (GCC 7+, Clang 3.8+, MSVC 2017+).
- If not possible, build on a different machine or container.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread Support on Unix-like OS">
- Confirm pthread development libraries are installed (e.g., `libpthread-dev` on Debian).
- Use `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if you must disable threading (not recommended).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Windows Build Issues Related to Runtime Library Mismatch">
- Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` in CMake to match your project’s runtime library.
- Ensure Visual Studio project settings for runtime libraries are consistent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File System or Stream Redirection Not Supported">
- May occur on embedded or constrained systems.
- Some tests or GoogleTest features (like death tests) may not be supported.
- Check platform compatibility documentation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Quick Summary
- Requires a compiler supporting **C++17 or later**.
- Officially supports a broad spectrum of platforms including Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and BSDs.
- Threading support requires pthread or equivalent platform threading.
- Build system recommendations prefer CMake >= 3.5.
- Customization macros allow enabled/disabled exceptions, RTTI, and threading.

Prepare your build environment accordingly to ensure a smooth GoogleTest setup and integration experience.
