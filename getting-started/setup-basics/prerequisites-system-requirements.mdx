# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the necessary system and compiler standards before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This will guarantee smooth installation, compatibility, and stable execution.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms, aligning with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). For the detailed, current list of supported platforms and tool versions, please refer to the official [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) matrix maintained by Google.

<Info>
Always verify platform and compiler compatibility before installation to prevent integration issues.
</Info>

---

## 2. Compiler Requirements

To build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock, a modern C++17 compatible compiler is mandatory. Commonly supported compilers include:

- **GCC 7.5+** (or higher)
- **Clang 6+**
- **MSVC Visual Studio 2017+**

<Check>
You must ensure your compiler supports C++17 features to avoid build failures.
</Check>

### Specifying the C++ Standard

When configuring your build system, explicitly set the C++ standard to C++17. For example, in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

If your project uses other build tools, consult their documentation on specifying C++17 compliance.

---

## 3. System Resources and Dependencies

### Minimal System Specs

- **Memory**: 1 GB RAM (minimal for compilation and test running)
- **Disk Space**: Approximately 100 MB for source, build, and installed files
- **Build Tools**: CMake 3.14+ for building GoogleTest as recommended

### Required Software:

- **CMake (3.14 or later)**: For cross-platform build and integration
- **Git**: To clone the GoogleTest repository and manage source updates

### Network Access

- Required to clone/download repositories. Configure firewall or proxy settings accordingly.

<Note>
If you plan to build GoogleMock along with GoogleTest, ensure your build environment supports C++ compilation for both.
</Note>

---

## 4. Build Environment Considerations

- **Multithreaded Test Support**: GoogleTest requires pthread support in Unix-like environments to run tests concurrently. If your build system does not detect pthread support automatically, define the flag manually:

```shell
g++ -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

- **Visual Studio Runtime Linking**:

  Visual Studio defaults to dynamic C runtime libraries, whereas GoogleTest links statically by default. To avoid linker errors, you can configure GoogleTest to link dynamically:

```shell
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

- **Shared vs Static Libraries**:

  By default, GoogleTest builds static libraries. If you prefer shared libraries (DLLs), add:

```shell
-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

and compile accordingly.

| Requirement                 | Details                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Operating Systems**       | Linux, Windows, Mac OS                        |
| **Compilers**               | GCC >=7.5, Clang >=6, MSVC/VS2017 or newer  |
| **C++ Standard**            | C++17 (explicitly specified)                 |
| **Build Tools**             | CMake >= 3.14, Git                           |
| **Memory & Disk**           | 1 GB RAM, 100 MB disk space                   |
| **Thread Support**          | Pthread on Unix-like systems to enable multithreading|
| **Runtime Libraries on MSVC**| Match runtime linkage with dynamic option if needed |

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Ensure you have installed a supported compiler version. Check your compiler version:

```shell
g++ --version
cl /?
clang --version
```

If unsupported, upgrade your compiler or switch to a supported environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread Library Not Found on Unix">
If your build fails with errors related to pthread:

- Confirm that pthread is installed on your system.
- If using your own build scripts, add `-lpthread` or equivalent linker flag.
- For CMake, ensure proper flags are set or define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Visual Studio Linker Errors Related to Runtime Libraries">
Mismatch errors like `RuntimeLibrary` value mismatch between GoogleTest and project indicate differing runtime linkage:

- Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` when running CMake to align runtimes.
- Alternatively, manually configure your project properties to use static or dynamic runtimes consistently.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

Once your environment meets these prerequisites, follow the [Installation Methods](../setup-basics/installation-methods) guide to build and integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

For detailed platform support and integration, consult the [Platform Support and Build Integration](../../overview/architecture-integration/platform-and-tool-integration) documentation.
