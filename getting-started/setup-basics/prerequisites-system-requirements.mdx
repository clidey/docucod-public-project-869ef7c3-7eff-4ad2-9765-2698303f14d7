# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin installing and using GoogleMock, it’s essential to confirm that your development environment meets all the necessary requirements. This page guides you through the critical system, compiler, and dependency prerequisites to ensure a smooth setup and successful build process.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Support

GoogleMock requires a compiler that supports **at least C++17**. This modern standard unlocks language features critical for GoogleMock’s capabilities and ensures compatibility.

### How to check your compiler’s C++ standard support:

- For GCC or Clang, run:
  ```bash
  g++ --version  # or clang++ --version
  ```
  Confirm that your version supports C++17 (usually GCC 7+ or Clang 5+).

- For MSVC (Visual Studio), **Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 or later** is required. Earlier versions will not compile GoogleMock.

<Tip>
On MSVC, if you see an error like `At least Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is required`, upgrade your Visual Studio installation.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleMock builds successfully on the following major compilers:

| Compiler                    | Minimum Version          | Notes                        |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) | 7.0.0 or later          | Supports full C++17           |
| Clang                       | 5.0 or later            | Full C++17 support            |
| MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++) | 2017 (v15.3) or later   | Must be at least Visual Studio 2017 |
| Intel LLVM                  | Compatible with C++17   | Check compiler documentation  |

<Tip>
Building with unsupported or older compiler versions will result in build failures or unexpected behavior.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleMock is cross-platform and officially tested on:

- Linux distributions
- macOS
- Windows (with supported MSVC versions)
- Some embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52 with Arduino support

<Tip>
For embedded platforms, initialization is customized — calling `testing::InitGoogleMock()` without parameters is recommended.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Build System Dependencies

GoogleMock integrates seamlessly with common build systems but requires the following tools to be present:

### CMake

- **Version 3.14 or newer** is recommended.
- CMake generates native builds for your platform and ensures correct compiler flags and dependencies.
- GoogleMock’s CMake scripts automatically detect and configure compiler flags for C++17 compliance.

### Bazel (optional)

- Bazel users can integrate GoogleMock with standard Bazel rules; confirm Bazel version compatibility in your workspace.

### Python 3 (optional)

- Required only if you plan to run certain tests that depend on Python scripts.

<Tip>
If CMake is not installed or you prefer manual configuration, you will need to ensure compiler flags and dependencies are correctly set; however, using CMake is strongly advised.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Threading Support

GoogleMock detects and uses threading primitives as available:

- Prefers POSIX threads (pthreads) on Unix-like systems if available and not explicitly disabled.
- On Windows and MinGW, Windows threading primitives are used instead.

If pthread detection fails, or you want to override the default, use the preprocessor flag:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # to enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # to disable
```

Ensure that your compiler and linker flags include any necessary threading libraries (e.g., `-pthread` for GCC).

---

## 6. Runtime Library Settings (MSVC Specific)

On Windows with MSVC, runtime library linkage must be consistent:

- GoogleMock by default uses the **static C runtime (CRT)**.
- If you want to use **dynamic runtime libraries**, configure `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake:
  ```bash
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

<Tip>
Mismatch of runtime libraries between your project and GoogleMock can lead to linker errors like `RuntimeLibrary mismatch`.
</Tip>

---

## 7. Verify Your Environment

Run these commands to confirm your environment compatibility:

```bash
# Check C++ compiler version
g++ --version

# Check your CMake version
cmake --version

# Confirm threading libraries are available (Linux/macOS)
pkg-config --modversion pthread || echo "pthread not found"
```

If all commands return versions indicating compatibility, your environment is ready.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Ensure you have a supported compiler version.

- Upgrade GCC/Clang to a version that supports C++17.
- For MSVC, install Visual Studio 2017 or later.

Check your build system flags to ensure `-std=c++17` (for GCC/Clang) or `/std:c++17` (for MSVC) are set.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing CMake or Outdated Version">
Download and install CMake from https://cmake.org/. Update to version 3.14 or higher.

On Linux, you may use package managers, but they may supply older versions. Consider manual installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows">
Toggle the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake configuration:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

Make sure your project and all dependencies use compatible CRT settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Threading Libraries Not Found">
Ensure that pthread development packages are installed on Unix-like systems.

- On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev`
- On Fedora: `sudo dnf install glibc-headers`

Check compiler and linker flags for `-pthread`.
</Accordion>

## Summary

Ensuring your development environment meets these prerequisites helps guarantee a hassle-free setup and build process for GoogleMock. Verifying compiler versions, platform compatibility, build tools, and threading support before installation saves time and protects against common build failures.

For detailed installation steps and configuration guidelines, proceed to the [Installation on Your Platform](../installation-instructions) page.

## Next Steps

- Confirm your environment against these requirements
- Install CMake and a supported compiler if missing
- Continue with [Installation Instructions](../installation-instructions) to build and install GoogleMock

<Check>
Your environment supports C++17, you have a supported compiler installed, CMake 3.14 or later is available, and necessary threading libraries are present.
</Check>
