# Prerequisites for GoogleTest

Prepare your development environment by ensuring all preliminary steps and essential dependencies are fulfilled. This page guides you through language and library requirements, compiler support, and integration considerations that are vital to install and run GoogleTest smoothly.

---

## 1. C++ Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a development environment that supports at least the **C++17 standard**. This is foundational to building and using the framework.

- Make sure your compiler is configured to use C++17 or a later standard.
- Set the standard explicitly in your build system, for example, in CMake:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If using other build tools, specify compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang, or `/std:c++17` for MSVC.


<Tip>
Ensure your compiler version meets the minimum requirements for full C++17 support. Consult the [System Requirements page](/getting-started/setup-basics/system-requirements) for detailed compatibility and supported compiler versions.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Upcoming and Optional Library Dependencies

GoogleTest plans support for integration with additional libraries such as **Abseil**. While this is not mandatory now, be aware of this evolving dependency as it will enhance the framework capabilities.

- For now, you do not need to install Abseil or other external dependencies.
- Keep an eye on release notes and upgrade guidelines to adopt these enhancements when they become available.

<Info>
The integration with libraries like Abseil will improve modularity and utility but will remain optional for users.

## 3. Environment Setup Recommendations

To create a seamless installation experience:

- Verify your build tools and compiler support multi-threading and C++17 features.
- If your project or environment involves libraries with specific threading requirements, verify compatibility accordingly.
- Ensure command line tools such as **CMake** and your compiler are installed and updated (CMake 3.14 or newer is recommended for integration tasks).


---

## 4. Access and Network Requirements

- A network connection is required to download GoogleTest from GitHub if you are fetching it via git clone or CMake's FetchContent.
- For firewalled or restricted environments, verify access to https://github.com/google/googletest.git and related URLs.


---

## 5. Practical Tips for a Smooth Start

- Always define your C++ standard in the top-level build configuration before including GoogleTest.
- Follow naming and code conventions from the Primer to avoid common pitfalls early.
- Check your compiler's multi-threading support if writing concurrent tests.
- Update your tools regularly to stay compatible with GoogleTest's evolving requirements.

<Warning>
Ignoring the C++17 requirement will cause build failures or undefined behaviors. Be proactive in ensuring your toolchain supports the required language features.
</Warning>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
- Make sure you are using a recent version of your compiler:
  - GCC 7 or later
  - Clang 5 or later
  - MSVC 2017 (15.7) or later
- Specify the C++17 standard explicitly in compiler flags.

If issues persist, consult your compiler's documentation on enabling C++17 support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake Version Too Old">
- Upgrade to CMake 3.14 or newer to benefit from FetchContent and other modern capabilities.
- Older versions may fail to download or build GoogleTest correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Access Blocked">
- Confirm firewall or proxy settings allow access to GitHub URLs.
- Consider downloading GoogleTest source manually and including it as a subdirectory.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps

Once your prerequisites are met, proceed to the installation and configuration steps:

- See [Build and Install from Source](/getting-started/installation-config/build-from-source) for detailed build instructions.
- For CMake-based projects, refer to [CMake Integration](/getting-started/installation-config/cmake-integration).
- Explore the [Primer and Hello Test](/getting-started/first-run-validation/primer-quickstart) to write and run your first test.

Stay informed with:
- [System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-basics/system-requirements)
- [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html)
