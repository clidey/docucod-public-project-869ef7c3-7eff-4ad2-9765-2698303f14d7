# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets these prerequisites before installing and using GoogleTest/GoogleMock. This guarantees compatibility and smooth operation.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is fully supported on the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (Visual Studio environment and MinGW)
- **Mac OS X**

It is designed to be highly portable and tested across these platforms.

## 2. Supported Compilers and C++ Standards

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17 or later** standards. This is crucial for successful compilation and correct execution.

Supported compilers include:

- GCC (with C++17 support)
- Clang (with C++17 support)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later

> **Tip:** Ensure your compiler is configured to use C++17, e.g., via `-std=c++17` flag on GCC/Clang or appropriate project settings in Visual Studio.

## 3. Build Tool Requirements

- **CMake:** GoogleTest uses a CMake build system. Version 3.14 or later is required to utilize all features fully, especially for convenient fetching and integration within other projects.

- If using other build systems (e.g., Bazel), ensure they support C++17 and can properly link GoogleTest sources or libraries.

## 4. System Resources

While GoogleTest itself is lightweight, your system should provide:

- Adequate CPU and memory resources to build and run your tests efficiently.
- Enough disk space for build artifacts and temporary files.

## 5. Access and Permissions

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install software on your system if doing a system-wide install, especially for `sudo make install` on Unix-like systems.

- If integrating GoogleTest into existing projects, access to the project’s build files for modification is necessary.

## 6. Networking Requirements

- No special network configurations are required to use GoogleTest itself.

- Internet connectivity may be required initially if using CMake’s `FetchContent` or similar mechanisms to download GoogleTest sources automatically during build configuration.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<Tip>
If your compiler does not support C++17, update your compiler or configure it properly to enable C++17 features.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Older versions of CMake (&lt;3.14) may not support all GoogleTest integration features. Update CMake if you encounter configuration errors.
</Warning>

<Note>
Ensure your build environment matches across GoogleTest and your project to avoid ABI or runtime conflicts—especially on Windows with runtime library linkage.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Once you verify your environment meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation) to install GoogleTest and start writing tests.
