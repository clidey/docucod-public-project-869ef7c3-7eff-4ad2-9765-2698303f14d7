# Prerequisites & System Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require your development environment to meet specific minimum standards to ensure smooth installation, compatibility, and optimal performance. This guide outlines the necessary C++ language versions, compiler recommendations, supported platforms, and essential tools you must have before proceeding.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard Version

- **C++17 or later is mandatory.**

  GoogleTest requires your compiler to support the C++17 standard fully. This is critical as the codebase uses features introduced in this version.

- **How to verify:**
  - Check your compiler documentation or run a test compile with the `-std=c++17` flag (or equivalent) enabled.

- **Tip:** Always enforce the C++17 standard in your build configuration, for example, with CMake:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

---

## 2. Recommended Compilers and Versions

GoogleTest has been tested with a variety of common C++ compilers and platforms. To avoid compatibility issues, use one of the following recommended compilers:

| Compiler          | Minimum Recommended Version | Notes                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| GCC               | 7.3+                        | Full C++17 support required |
| Clang             | 6.0+                        | Compatible with C++17        |
| Microsoft Visual C++ | Visual Studio 2017 (15.7+) | Includes MSVC 2017 Update    |
| Apple Clang       | Xcode 10+                   | Compatible with C++17        |


- **Additional notes:**
  - Some older compiler versions may compile but produce warnings or fail certain tests.
  - Microsoft Visual C++ users must be cautious about runtime library settings (dynamic vs static CRT). See [Visual Studio Dynamic vs Static Runtimes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md#generic-build-instructions) for troubleshooting.

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports major development platforms. Ensure your target platform is one of the following:

- **Linux:** Multiple distributions with modern GCC or Clang compilers.
- **Windows:** With Visual Studio 2017 or later.
- **Mac OS X:** With Xcode 10 or later.

Cross-compilation or unusual environments are not officially supported.


---

## 4. Development Tools and Build System

- **CMake:** Required to build GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

  - Minimum recommended version: 3.14 (due to FetchContent commands used in some build integration scenarios).
  - You can download CMake at <https://cmake.org/download/>.

- **Build tools:**

  - Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, or Xcode as appropriate for your platform.
  
- **Git:** Required if cloning the GoogleTest repository directly.

### Example Setup Flow

```shell
# Clone GoogleTest repository
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure build (enable GoogleMock by default)
cmake ..

# Build
make  # or use Visual Studio/Xcode as appropriate
```

- To build GoogleTest only without GoogleMock:

```shell
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
``` 

---

## 5. Additional Considerations

- **Thread Safety:** GoogleTest is thread-safe when pthread support is available. On POSIX systems, ensure your compiler flags include pthread linking (e.g., `-pthread`).

- **Virtual Destructors in Interfaces:** When mocking classes, ensure interfaces have virtual destructors for proper cleanup. This is critical to avoid memory leaks and test failures.

- **Compiler Flags:** 
  - Enable all warnings to catch portability issues early.
  - Define any necessary macros recommended for your build environment.

- **IDE Support:** GoogleTest integrates with most popular IDEs through plugins or native support (Visual Studio Test Explorer, CLion, etc.). Make sure your environment is configured accordingly.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **C++ Standard Mismatch:** If you encounter build errors related to language features, verify the C++17 standard is correctly configured in your build system.

- **Unrecognized Compiler Flags:** GoogleTest's CMake scripts detect compilers automatically, but custom toolchains might require manual configuration.

- **Missing Build Tools:** Make sure `cmake` and your compiler toolchain executables are on your system `PATH`.

- **Runtime Linking errors:** Confirm that the runtime libraries (static vs dynamic) settings match across your project and GoogleTest build.

- **Unsupported Platforms:** Custom or embedded platforms are unsupported; expect build errors or missing features.

---

## 7. Summary

Meeting the minimum C++17 requirement, using a supported compiler on a tested platform, and preparing an appropriate build environment are critical steps for a smooth GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup. Taking care of these prerequisites upfront prevents installation errors and streamlines your testing workflow.
