# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements before installing and using GoogleTest. This verification step is critical to guarantee a smooth setup and effective use of the testing framework.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to work reliably across the major operating systems commonly used for C++ development:

- **Linux**
- **Windows**
- **macOS**

This cross-platform support enables tests developed with GoogleTest to be portable and reusable across development environments.

### Tips
- Verify you have the necessary permissions to build and install software on your platform.
- On Windows, ensure integration with Visual Studio is feasible if you plan to use that IDE.

---

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler that supports at least the C++17 standard. Supported compiler versions typically include:

- **GCC 7.0** (or higher)
- **Clang 5.0** (or higher)
- **MSVC Visual Studio 2017 (v15.7) or later**

Ensure that your compiler is set up to use **C++17** or a newer standard.

### How to check your compiler version:

- **GCC**: Run `gcc --version` or `g++ --version`
- **Clang**: Run `clang --version` or `clang++ --version`
- **MSVC**: Check Visual Studio version or run `cl`


### Enforcing C++17 in your build

When using CMake, specify the required standard explicitly:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

For other build systems, ensure the equivalent compiler flags set C++17 or later.

---

## 3. Build Tools & Dependencies

- **CMake** (minimum version 3.14) is the recommended build system for building GoogleTest and integrating it into your projects.
  - Download from https://cmake.org/
  - Compatible with various build backends like Make, Ninja, and Visual Studio solutions.

- **Build tools** corresponding to your environment:
  - Make (Unix/Linux)
  - Ninja (cross-platform)
  - Visual Studio (Windows)

### Notes
- While GoogleTest can be compiled and linked manually, using CMake simplifies dependency management and integration.
- Ensure your build tools are updated and compatible with C++17.

---

## 4. Hardware & System Requirements

While GoogleTest itself is lightweight, consider these minimal requirements for development and testing:

- **Disk Space:** At least 100 MB for source, build, and test artifacts
- **Memory:** 1 GB or more for smooth compilation and execution
- **Processor:** Any modern CPU capable of running your build tools and compiler

---

## 5. Environment Setup

Before installation, verify:

- Your PATH environment includes the compiler and CMake.
- Necessary environment variables (e.g., `TEST_TMPDIR` for temporary file storage) are set appropriately.
- No conflicting versions of GoogleTest from previous installations could interfere.

---

## 6. Summary Checklist

Follow this pre-installation verification to avoid surprises:

- [ ] Running on Linux, Windows, or macOS
- [ ] Compiler supports C++17 or newer
- [ ] CMake 3.14 or later installed
- [ ] Build tools compatible and available
- [ ] Sufficient disk space and memory
- [ ] Environment variables correctly set

---

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

### Compiler not recognizing C++17
- Check compiler flags or settings. For GCC and Clang, ensure `-std=c++17` or equivalent is used.
- Verify compiler version meets minimum support.

### CMake missing or outdated
- Install or upgrade to a supported version (3.14+).

### Build tools not found
- Add tools to your system PATH or install proper build tools for your platform.

### Permission issues
- Run commands with administrative rights if installation fails.
- Check directory write permissions.

## Next Steps

After confirming your system meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation-instructions) to build and install GoogleTest. For guidance on configuring your tests, visit [Configuration & Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup-basics/configuration-setup).

Also, explore the [GoogleTest Primer](overview/about-googletest/introduction) for an introduction to writing tests once setup is complete.

| Requirement           | Details                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Platforms             | Linux, Windows, macOS                         |
| Compiler              | GCC >=7, Clang >=5, MSVC >=2017 (v15.7)      |
| C++ Standard          | C++17 minimum                                |
| Build System          | CMake >=3.14                                 |
| Hardware             | Typical modern development machine            |

# Example: Check your Compiler Version and Settings

```bash
# Check GCC version
gcc --version

# Check Clang version
clang --version

# C++17 compilation example with g++
g++ -std=c++17 -o your_test your_test.cc
```

---

# Example: Check CMake Version

```bash
cmake --version
```

If your version is lower than 3.14, upgrade it to meet GoogleTest's build requirements.

# Summary

This page ensures that your environment is ready to build and run GoogleTest by verifying platform compatibility, compiler support, C++ standard compliance, and build tool availability before installation.

<Check>
Make sure your compiler supports C++17 by testing `g++ -std=c++17 --version` or equivalent.
</Check>

<Info>
GoogleTest utilizes CMake for builds; installing version 3.14 or newer simplifies integration.
</Info>

<Warning>
Installing GoogleTest on unsupported compilers or platforms will lead to build failures.
