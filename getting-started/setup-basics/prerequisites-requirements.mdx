# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, ensure your environment meets the following hardware, software, and platform requirements. Adhering to these prerequisites guarantees a smooth installation, configuration, and execution of your tests with full compatibility.

---

## 1. Hardware Requirements

- **Processor:** Any processor supporting your chosen operating system and compiler.
- **Memory:** Minimum 512 MB RAM; 1 GB or more recommended for large codebases or extensive test suites.
- **Storage:** At least 100 MB of free disk space to accommodate the libraries, source files, and test artifacts.

> GoogleTest and GoogleMock have minimal hardware demands but benefit from a modern system for faster builds and test execution.

## 2. Operating System Support

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support multiple major operating systems, provided later sectionsâ€™ requirements are met:

- **Linux:** Most popular distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS.
- **Windows:** Windows 7 and later, including Windows 10 and Windows Server versions.
- **macOS:** Versions supporting C++17 and the required compilers.

> Refer to the official [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/portability.md) for detailed versions and notes.

## 3. Compiler Requirements

### Minimum C++ Standard Version
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock require **C++17** or later. This is critical as the framework uses modern language features for functionality and performance.

### Supported Compiler Versions
- **GCC:** Version 7.3 or later
- **Clang:** Version 6.0 or later
- **Microsoft Visual C++:** Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or later

> For best experience, use the latest stable compiler versions that support C++17 fully. Older compilers may result in build or runtime failures.

## 4. Software Dependencies

- **Build Systems:** The framework integrates smoothly with popular build tools such as Bazel, CMake, and Make. Make sure to have your preferred build system installed and configured.
- **Standard C++ Library:** A standard-conforming C++ standard library supporting C++17 features.
- **Optional:**
  - If you plan to use GoogleMock, include `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` and ensure that GoogleMock is built alongside GoogleTest.

## 5. Network and Access Requirements

- No special network requirements are needed to run GoogleTest or GoogleMock locally.
- To download or update the framework, ensure access to GitHub or your selected source repository.

## 6. Official Support and Compatibility Policies

GoogleTest and GoogleMock follow foundational support policies:

- Only platforms and compilers officially tested and documented are supported.
- This ensures stability, performance, and security guarantees.
- Community contributions may extend compatibility but might not be officially supported.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Confirm C++17 Support:** Verify your compiler flags include `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
- **Consistent Environment:** Use the same compiler and OS versions as your CI/CD build environment to prevent discrepancies.
- **Update Tooling:** Keep compilers and build systems up to date to benefit from fixes and optimizations.
- **Consult the Compatibility Matrix:** Google's official compatibility matrix is authoritative for determining supported configurations.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using Older Compiler Versions:** Attempting to build with compilers earlier than required C++17 support will cause compilation failures.
- **Linking Without GoogleMock:** If you intend to use mock features, omitting GoogleMock from the build can cause linker errors.
- **Incorrect Compiler Flags:** Missing or conflicting compiler flags related to language standard or ABI compatibility might silently break builds.
