# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Welcome to the foundation of your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup journey! This page ensures you understand the essential system requirements, supported compilers, C++ standards, and key dependencies needed for a smooth, successful experience with GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms & Environment

GoogleTest and its companion GoogleMock are designed with portability and flexibility in mind. To avoid unexpected build or runtime problems, ensure your environment aligns with the following requirements.

### Operating Systems Supported:
- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (including Visual Studio environments)
- **MacOS**

### Compiler Support:
GoogleTest supports modern C++ compilers that conform to C++11 or later standards, including:
- GCC 4.8 and newer
- Clang 3.3 and newer
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and newer

Ensure that your compiler supports the C++11 standard, as GoogleTest utilizes modern language features for robust testing.

<Note>
Using updated compilers with good C++11 support significantly reduces build complexity and runtime issues.
</Note>

## 2. C++ Standards Required

GoogleTest leverages C++11 features by default. Your project environment must:

- Compile code with **-std=c++11** or a later standard enabled (such as c++14, c++17, or c++20).
- Support features including smart pointers, variadic templates, and constexpr, which are essential for certain GoogleTest and GoogleMock functionalities.

<Warning>
Attempting to use GoogleTest with older C++ standards or compilers lacking C++11 support will lead to compilation failures or undefined behavior.
</Warning>

## 3. External Dependencies

GoogleTest is broadly self-contained for its core capabilities. However, understanding integration and dependency points helps prevent setup snags.

- **Abseil library:** When using GoogleMock integration or advanced features, some components may rely on the [Abseil C++ library](https://abseil.io/). Check your build system to ensure these are available or properly linked.
- **Build Systems:** GoogleTest integrates well with major build systems like CMake and Bazel. Ensure you have these configured correctly to manage dependencies transparently.

<Info>
Refer to the `Integration & Dependencies` guide for in-depth setup examples tailored to your build environment.
</Info>

## 4. System Resource Expectations

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are lightweight and impose minimal system requirements.

- **Memory:** A few megabytes are sufficient for most test suites. For very large or complex projects, plan for additional overhead.
- **Disk Space:** The source code and binaries are small; ensure you have at least 50 MB free for source and build artifacts.

## 5. Account and Access Requirements

Since GoogleTest is an open-source C++ testing framework:

- No special accounts or credentials are required to use it.
- For repository access or contribution, a GitHub account with appropriate permissions is necessary.

## 6. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- Network access is only needed to clone the repository from GitHub or fetch dependencies like Abseil when using remote build systems.
- No runtime network connectivity is required for executing tests.

<Check>
Make sure your firewall allows cloning from `https://github.com/google/googletest` if working behind restrictive proxies.
</Check>

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Compiler Flags:** Always specify the C++ standard (e.g., `-std=c++11`) explicitly in your build configuration, to avoid defaulting to older standards.
- **Matching Compiler & Build System:** Ensure the versions of compilers and build system tools are compatible. For example, using an outdated CMake with a modern compiler may result in incomplete or broken configuration.
- **Do Not Mix C++ Standards:** Avoid mixing source files compiled with different C++ standards as this may cause linkage failures.

<Warning>
Omitting required external dependencies or misconfiguring build tools are the most common causes of setup issues.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems & Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors Related to C++ Version">
If your build fails with errors about missing type features or keywords, verify your compiler's C++ standard setting.

**Solution:** Add or update your compiler flags to `-std=c++11` or later.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unresolved Symbols or Missing Libraries">
This usually indicates missing dependencies or incorrect library linking.

**Solution:** Confirm that your build system includes all necessary files and any external dependencies like Abseil are correctly linked.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compatibility Problems on Windows">
Older Visual Studio versions or incorrect project settings can cause compatibility issues.

**Solution:** Use Visual Studio 2015 or newer, ensure the platform toolset matches, and that the project sets C++11 standard compliance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Discovery Fails or Tests Don’t Run">
Improper installation or missing initialization can cause tests to not be detected.

**Solution:** Make sure to call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` or `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` in your main function before running tests.
</Accordion>
