# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page details the essential prerequisites and system requirements you need to meet before building and running GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Understanding these requirements upfront ensures a smooth setup process and avoids common build and compatibility issues.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standards

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require your build environment to support at least **C++17** standard. This is critical for successful compilation and full functionality.

- Ensure your compiler is configured to use C++17 or later.
- Example CMake setting to enforce C++17:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

> Note: If you don’t use CMake, specify the appropriate `-std=c++17` compiler flag manually.

---

## 2. Required Build Tools

To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock, your system must have the following tools installed:

- **C++ Compiler**
  - Must support C++17 fully.
  - Officially supported compilers include:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
    - GCC
    - Clang
- **Build System**
  - GoogleTest provides a community-supported CMake build script.
  - CMake version **3.13** or newer is required.
- **Make or Ninja** (or equivalent build tool)
  - On Unix-like systems, GNU Make or Ninja is commonly used.
- **Git**
  - Needed to clone the GoogleTest repository and submodules.

### Optional Dependencies

- If you enable GoogleMock, standard C++ libraries and threading support are necessary.
- For certain platforms, pthreads may be required.

---

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed for **cross-platform compatibility** and officially support:

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Linux
  - Windows
  - macOS
  - UNIX variants
  - Some embedded platforms (e.g., ESP32, ESP8266)

- **Threading:**
  - Built to be thread-safe on platforms where `pthreads` is available.
  - On Windows and other systems lacking pthreads, caution is advised.

> For details on platform-specific nuances and any limitations, consult the [Supported Platforms & Requirements](../overview/adoption-and-integration/supported-platforms-and-requirements) page.

---

## 4. Environment Setup Checks

Before proceeding, verify the following on your system:

### Compiler Capability

Run your compiler with the following test to confirm C++17 support:

```bash
# Example for GCC or Clang
echo "int main() { return 0; }" | g++ -std=c++17 -x c++ - -o /dev/null
```

If compilation fails, update your compiler or adjust its configuration.

### Build Tools Version

- Check CMake version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

Ensure the version is **3.13** or later.

- Verify `make` or `ninja` availability:

```bash
make --version
# or
ninja --version
```

### Git Setup

Confirm Git is installed and accessible:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## 5. Additional Notes

- **Thread Safety:** GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread. If your platform lacks pthread, concurrent assertions might not be safe.

- **Visual Studio Runtime Compatibility:**
  - When building with Visual Studio, be aware of runtime library mismatches between your test project and GoogleTest. You can control this with the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to use the shared (DLL) runtime.

- **Building GoogleTest as Static or Shared Library:**
  - By default, GoogleTest builds as a static library.
  - To build as a shared library, define the macro `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when compiling.
  - When linking tests with shared GoogleTest, add `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

---

## 6. Quick Prerequisites Checklist

<Check>
- C++17-compliant compiler is installed and configured.
- CMake version 3.13 or newer is available.
- Supported platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, UNIX, or embedded) is selected.
- Git is installed.
- Relevant build tools (`make`, `ninja`, or equivalent) are installed.
- Optional: pthread library available for thread safety on Unix-like systems.
</Check>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Problems and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Compiler does not support C++17">
  Ensure your compiler is up to date. For example, GCC 7 or later and Clang 5 or later fully support C++17.

  See your compiler's documentation on how to specify the C++17 standard flag.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake version too old">
  Upgrade CMake to at least version 3.13. On many systems, CMake can be updated via package managers or downloaded directly from https://cmake.org/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime library mismatch on Windows with Visual Studio">
  Set the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option ON when building GoogleTest within CMake to align runtime linkage:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread library on Unix-like systems">
  Install `pthread` development headers and libraries.

  On Debian/Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev
  ```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Git not installed or not in PATH">
  Install Git from https://git-scm.com/ and ensure it is accessible via command line.
</Accordion>
