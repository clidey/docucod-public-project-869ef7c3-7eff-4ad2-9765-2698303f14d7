# Alternative Installation Methods

This page outlines alternative ways to incorporate GoogleTest into your development workflow beyond the primary installation methods like CMake or Bazel. These options are designed to address less common but useful scenarios, such as integrating directly via source files or using package managers, providing flexibility to suit diverse environments and workflows.

---

## 1. Incorporating GoogleTest Source Files Directly

If you want to avoid external dependencies or build system integration, you can include GoogleTest and GoogleMock source files directly into your project.

### Steps:

1. **Download Source Code:** Clone or download the GoogleTest source tree from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).

2. **Copy Source Files:** From the `googletest` and `googlemock` folders, copy the following into your project source tree:
   - `googletest/src/gtest-all.cc`
   - `googlemock/src/gmock-all.cc`
   - All corresponding header files from `googletest/include/gtest` and `googlemock/include/gmock`

3. **Add to Build:** Add these source files to your build system manually, compiling them as part of your test executable.

4. **Include Headers:** Include GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers in your test files as usual:
   ```cpp
   #include "gtest/gtest.h"
   #include "gmock/gmock.h"
   ```

5. **Compile and Link:** Ensure that these source files are compiled with the same compiler flags and linked appropriately.

### Tips & Best Practices
- Keep these files updated periodically from the upstream repository to get bug fixes and improvements.
- This approach is straightforward but might increase build times, so consider selective compilation or caching.
- Enables easy debugging into GoogleTest and GoogleMock sources.

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to compile all required source files leads to linker errors.
- Mixing incompatible versions of GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and sources can cause compilation issues.

## 2. Using Package Managers

GoogleTest can be installed and managed via package managers on many platforms, easing installation and updates.

### Examples:

- **vcpkg** (Windows, Linux, Mac):

  ```bash
  vcpkg install gtest
  ```

  Then integrate with your CMake project:

  ```cmake
  find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)
  target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)
  ```

- **Conan:**

  Add to your `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py`:

  ```ini
  [requires]
google-test/1.12.1
  ```

  Then update your build scripts accordingly.

- **apt-get** (Debian/Ubuntu):

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
  ```

  *Note:* On Debian-based systems, you must manually build the library after installation:

  ```bash
  cd /usr/src/gtest
  sudo cmake .
  sudo make
  sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
  ```

### Benefits
- Easy to install and update using native platform tools.
- Reduces complexity in build system setup.

### Limitations
- Package versions may lag behind the official repository.
- Some package managers do not include GoogleMock by default; separate package installation may be needed.

## 3. Using GoogleTest and GoogleMock as Submodules or Git Subtrees

To maintain tight control over the versions used within your project, you can use Git submodules or subtrees.

### Steps for Git Submodules:

1. Add GoogleTest as a submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/google/googletest.git external/googletest
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Reference the submodule in your build system (CMake example):
   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(external/googletest)
   target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE gtest gmock)
   ```

### Benefits
- Keeps dependencies under source control.
- Simplifies version pinning.

### Considerations
- Requires understanding of Git submodules.
- Needs to keep submodules updated explicitly.

| Method                           | Highlights                               | When to Use                           |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Direct Source Inclusion          | Full control, simple inclusion          | Small projects, or rapid prototyping|
| Package Managers (vcpkg, Conan) | Easy install and update                  | Standard development workflows      |
| Git Submodules/Subtrees          | Pin versions with source control        | Larger teams or reproducible builds |

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter linking errors, confirm all necessary source files or libraries are included.
- For compilation errors regarding mismatched headers and sources, sync versions from the same release.
- Using package managers, verify the installed version has GoogleMock included or install it separately.
- When using submodules, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.
