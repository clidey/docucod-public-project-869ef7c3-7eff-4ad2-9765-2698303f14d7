# Running Your Tests

This guide helps you execute your newly built test binaries using GoogleTest, interpret the results, and verify successful test runs. Whether you're on Linux, Windows, or Mac, this document presents clear, actionable instructions to run your tests effectively and leverage GoogleTest’s flexible test execution options.

---

## 1. Running Your Test Binary

Once you have built your test executable, running your tests is straightforward.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.** Navigate to the directory containing your test binary.

2. **Execute the test binary directly:**

   ```bash
   ./your_test_binary
   ```

   On Windows, you may run:

   ```cmd
   your_test_binary.exe
   ```

3. **Observe output:** GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs all registered tests within the binary. The console output will display each test's pass or fail status along with summarized results.


### Expected Outcome

- Test results are grouped by test suites.
- Each test shows as `[  PASSED  ]` or `[  FAILED  ]`.
- At the end, you get a summary indicating the total number of tests run, passed, and failed.

<Tip>
If your tests fail immediately or no tests run, ensure your test executable is properly built and that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is invoked in your `main()` function.
</Tip>

## 2. Using GoogleTest Flags for Flexible Test Execution

GoogleTest supports multiple command-line flags to control which tests run and how output is presented.

### Commonly Used Flags

- **Run a subset of tests using `--gtest_filter`:**

  Run only tests matching patterns, which are either `TestSuiteName.TestName` or wildcards:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*
  ```

  This runs all tests in the `FactorialTest` suite.

  To include and exclude patterns:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*-FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
  ```

- **List all tests without running them:**

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
  ```

- **Run disabled tests:** Disabled tests have prefix `DISABLED_`. To include them:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
  ```

- **Control output format:**

  Generate XML report:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
  ```

- **Set random seed for test order:**

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_random_seed=12345
  ```

### Example Usage

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=QueueTest.DequeueWorks
```

This runs only the `DequeueWorks` test within the `QueueTest` suite.

<Note>
Flags must be passed at runtime when executing the test binary, not during build.
</Note>

## 3. Interpreting the Test Output

GoogleTest provides detailed output to help you understand test execution results.

### Output Breakdown

- **Test suite and test names:** Clearly labeled with suite and test names.
- **Result status:** `[  PASSED  ]` or `[  FAILED  ]` next to each test.
- **Failure details:** If a test fails, GoogleTest prints the source file and line number, along with the failed assertion message.
- **Summary:** A concise summary including total tests run, passed, failed, and the elapsed time.

### Sample Output

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
/path/to/test_file.cc:25: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(3)
    Which is: 5
  6
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

<Tip>
A `[  FAILED  ]` test includes file and line information to help debug immediately.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying Test Execution

To confirm your tests have run correctly:

1. **Ensure your `main()` calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`:** This is crucial for automatically running all registered tests.

2. **Check test count:** The output summary should match the number of tests you expect to run.

3. **Verify no unexpected skips or zero tests run:** If no tests run, verify your filters, test registration, and build.

4. **Review failures closely:** Assert whether failures correspond to known issues, or are unexpected.

5. **Run tests with `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm discovery:**

   ```bash
   ./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
   ```

   This command confirms which tests are registered and ready to run.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Test Run Issues

### Tests Not Running

- Verify that tests are defined using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` macros.
- Confirm your `main()` function calls `testing::InitGoogleTest()` and returns `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Check `--gtest_filter` flags for unintended exclusion.

### Immediate Failures at Startup

- Confirm that the test environment setup does not produce fatal failures.
- Use verbose output to troubleshoot environment setup failures.

### No Output / Hanging Tests

- Check for infinite loops or deadlocks inside your tests.
- Use timeouts or debugger to isolate stalls.

<Warning>
Ignoring the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` can lead to misleading success; always return it.
</Warning>
