# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist guides you through crucial verification steps to confirm your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup is successful and ready for use. Follow these essential checks for a fast confidence boost before deeper exploration or running your own tests.

---

## 1. Verify Header Inclusion

Ensure you can include the main GoogleTest header in your test file without errors:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

For code involving mocks, also include GoogleMock's header:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
```

If these headers fail to include, re-check your include paths and installation.

## 2. Write and Build a Minimal Test

Create a simple test to confirm your environment compiles and links correctly.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SanityCheck, Truth) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

Compile this with your build setup linking against GoogleTest (and GoogleMock if mocking is used).

*Successful compilation and linking mean your build environment and dependencies are configured properly.*

## 3. Run the Test Binary

Execute the compiled test binary. It should automatically run all registered tests and output a report.

Expected output for the sample test:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck
[ RUN      ] SanityCheck.Truth
[       OK ] SanityCheck.Truth (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

A zero exit code indicates success, while a non-zero code indicates failure.

## 4. Inspect Output for Warning or Errors

- **No warnings or linker errors:** Your setup is sound and GoogleTest is functioning.
- **Unexpected warnings about uninteresting mock calls:** Consider adding `EXPECT_CALL` or switch to using `NiceMock` to suppress noise.
- **Missing tests in output:** Ensure your test code is correctly linked and tests are registered.

## 5. Check Environment Consistency

- Confirm your test binary uses the same standard library and compiler settings that GoogleTest was built with.
- Verify that all dynamic libraries (if any) of GoogleTest/GoogleMock are properly found during execution.

## 6. Optional: Run Sample Client Tests

If available, run example tests or sample tests bundled with GoogleTest or GoogleMock:

- They often reside in a `samples/` or `tests/` directory.
- Successful runs verify that all components, features, and integrations work as expected.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If inclusion fails, check your `-I` compiler flags and install targets.
- Linker errors commonly indicate missing `-lgtest` or `-lgmock` libraries or improper linking order.
- Running with `--gmock_verbose=info` provides detailed tracing for mock calls.
- Use `gtest_discover_tests` if integrated with CMake to automate test discovery.

### Final Notes

Successfully passing this checklist means your environment is ready to write and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock tests confidently.

For detailed setup instructions, writing your first test, and using mocks effectively, consult related documentation sections.

**Tip:** Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before running tests to ensure correct command-line flag parsing and test registration.
