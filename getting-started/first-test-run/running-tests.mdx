# Running and Validating Tests

Learn how to execute your GoogleTest test suite, understand the output, and verify that the framework is correctly integrated within your environment. This guide walks you through invoking tests, interpreting results, and confirming successful test runs.

---

## 1. Preparing to Run Tests

Before running your tests, ensure that:

- Your tests have been written and compiled successfully. See [Writing and Building Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-run/writing-first-test).
- Your environment is configured to execute test binaries built with GoogleTest or GoogleMock.
- You have linked your test binary against either `gtest_main` (for simple GoogleTest usage) or `gmock_main` (if you use GoogleMock).

<Check>
If you have your own `main()` function, it must initialize GoogleTest or GoogleMock correctly before running tests. Usually, linking with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` removes the need to write a custom `main()`.
</Check>

---

## 2. Invoking Your Test Suite

### Step 1: Run the Test Executable

Simply execute your compiled test binary from the command line:

```bash
./my_test_binary
```

This command runs all tests linked into the binary, automatically discovering all registered `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` tests.

<Info>
By default, all tests are executed unless you specify filters (covered in advanced guides).
</Info>

### Step 2: Understand the Initialization

GoogleTest programs start with a call to `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` or `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` which parses command-line flags that control test execution parameters.

On completion, the framework calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` which:

- Runs all registered tests
- Reports success or failure
- Returns an exit code that signals test outcome (`0` for success, non-zero on failure)

**Important:** Your `main()` function must return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

---

## 3. Interpreting Test Output

When you run your tests, GoogleTest outputs details such as:

- The name of each test suite and test case
- The result of each test (`[   PASSED   ]` or `[  FAILED  ]`)
- Failure information including file names, line numbers, and messages

Example output from a successful run:

```plaintext
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

<Check>
The line `[  PASSED  ]` indicates all tests passed successfully.
</Check>

---

## 4. Validating GoogleTest Integration

### Confirm Correct Setup by Running Your Tests

If you have followed the previous [Writing and Building Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-run/writing-first-test) guide, run your test executable. A successful run confirming GoogleTest is correctly configured will display:

- A message indicating the test runner is starting (e.g., `Running main() from gmock_main.cc`).
- All your tests running with status reports.
- A final summary line reporting the count of passed/failed tests.
- Program exit code `0` indicating success.

### Return Value Check

Always check your test executable's exit code:

```bash
./my_test_binary
echo $?
```

An exit code of `0` means all tests passed. Non-zero indicates one or more failing tests.

### Using GoogleMock

If your tests include mocks from GoogleMock, confirm that `testing::InitGoogleMock()` is called in `main()`. Typically, link against `gmock_main` which provides a `main()` implementation that calls `InitGoogleMock()` and runs tests automatically.

---

## 5. Running Tests with Common Options

GoogleTest can accept command-line flags to customize test execution, for example:

- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` to run a specific test
- `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times

For a full list, see the advanced guides, but hereâ€™s a quick example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
```

This runs only the specified test.

<Note>
Filtering and other advanced options help you focus on problems during development.
</Note>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Test Runs

### Problem: No Tests Run

- Make sure your test binary includes test definitions linked correctly.
- Confirm `main()` calls `InitGoogleTest()` or you link with `gtest_main`.
- Check the GoogleTest filter flag is not excluding all tests (`--gtest_filter`).

### Problem: Unexpected Test Failures

- Review assertions in your tests; failed assertions provide file and line info.
- Use `EXPECT_*` assertions when you want tests to continue after failure for broader diagnostics.
- Use `ASSERT_*` where continuing makes no sense if a condition fails.

### Problem: Test Binary Exits Unexpectedly

- Ensure your `main()` returns `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` result.
- If using GoogleMock, confirm `InitGoogleMock()` is called instead of just `InitGoogleTest()`.

<Warning>
Ignore neither test output nor return codes; CI systems depend on exit status.
</Warning>

## 7. Next Steps

Once you have successfully run and interpreted your first tests:

- Explore writing more comprehensive test suites and fixtures in [Writing and Building Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-run/writing-first-test).
- Learn about integrating mocks with [Mocking with GoogleMock: A Practical Introduction](/guides/core-workflows/mocking-basics).
- Refer to [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-test-run/troubleshooting-setup) if you encounter difficulties.

Keep iterating your tests to build confidence and code quality using the full power of GoogleTest.

## Sample main() Functions

### Using gtest_main (No custom main required)

Simply link against `gtest_main` and run your tests.

### Custom main() Using GoogleTest

If you want a custom `main()`, use this pattern:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Custom main() Using GoogleMock

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## Summary

| Status             | Meaning                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Exit code == 0     | All tests passed             |
| Exit code != 0     | One or more test failures    |

Use these exit codes to automate quality gates in CI/CD pipelines.
