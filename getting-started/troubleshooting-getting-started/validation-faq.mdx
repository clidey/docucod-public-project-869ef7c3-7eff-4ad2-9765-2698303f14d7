# Getting Started FAQ

Quick answers to common questions during initial setup, configuration, and testing help accelerate your GoogleTest onboarding. If you hit a snag, this page directs you to deeper troubleshooting resources to get back on track.

---

## Why shouldn't test suite and test names contain underscores (`_`)?

GoogleTest reserves underscores for special purposes, such as the `DISABLED_` prefix to skip tests. Using underscores in test suite or test names can cause conflicts, unexpected compiler errors, or test registration problems.

**Key points:**

- Names must not start or end with `_`.
- Avoid underscores anywhere in the names to prevent name collisions.
- This restriction keeps test names unique and avoids internal macro conflicts.

For full details, see the [Getting Started FAQ - Naming](faq/usage-and-troubleshooting/getting-started-faq#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore).

---

## How do `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` assertions differ, and when should I use each?

- `ASSERT_` macros generate **fatal failures** that abort the current function immediately. Use these when continuing the test does not make sense.
- `EXPECT_` macros generate **nonfatal failures**, allowing the test to continue and report multiple errors.

Use `EXPECT_` when you want to see all failures in a run, and `ASSERT_` if failure means there's no point continuing (e.g., a pointer is null before dereferencing).

See the [GoogleTest Primer - Assertions](primer.md#assertions) for examples and usage guidelines.

---

## Why does GoogleTest insist on returning the value from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in `main()`?

The return code of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` indicates success (`0`) or failure (`1`). Ignoring it can lead to misleading results where failed tests are treated as passing.

Always write:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This ensures your test executable reflects the correct outcome to build systems and CI pipelines.

---

## Can I use GoogleTest assertions in constructor or destructor?

No. `ASSERT_` and `FAIL` macros generate fatal failures that abort the current function, but constructors and destructors are not void-returning functions. Using fatal assertions there results in compile errors.

Instead:

- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods in test fixtures for setup and cleanup where assertions are allowed.
- For non-fatal checks, `EXPECT_` macros can be used but are usually discouraged in constructors/destructors.

Refer to the [Advanced Topics - Assertion Placement](advanced.md#assertion-placement) and [FAQ - Constructors and Destructors](faq/usage-and-troubleshooting/getting-started-faq#my-compiler-complains-no-matching-function-to-call-for-foo) for guidance.

---

## How do I create tests that share common setup data?

Use *test fixtures*, which are classes derived from `testing::Test` that contain shared objects and setup/teardown logic.

Basic workflow:

1. Define a fixture class:

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize shared resources
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
  }

  // Test data members
};
```

2. Use `TEST_F()` macro to write tests that use this fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test1) {
  EXPECT_EQ(...);
}
```

The fixture ensures each test gets a fresh environment.

See [GoogleTest Primer - Test Fixtures](primer.md#test-fixtures-using-the-same-data-configuration-for-multiple-tests) for examples.

---

## What are death tests and how should I name and write them?

*Death tests* verify that code terminates program execution (e.g., due to assertion failures or fatal errors).

Best practices:

- Put death tests in test suites with names ending in `DeathTest`.
- Use macros like `EXPECT_DEATH()` or `ASSERT_DEATH()` with the statement expected to cause death and a regex for expected error message.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, DiesOnNull) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(FunctionThatExits(nullptr), "null pointer");
}
```

Follow the guidelines in [Advanced Topics - Death Tests](advanced.md#death-tests) and [Assertions Reference - Death Assertions](reference/assertions.md#death).

---

## How can I control which tests run?

You can filter tests by name using the command line flag `--gtest_filter` or the environment variable `GTEST_FILTER`.

- Use wildcard patterns `*` and `?`.
- For example, to run tests in suite `MySuite` only:

  ```
  --gtest_filter=MySuite.*
  ```

- To exclude death tests:

  ```
  --gtest_filter=-*DeathTest.*
  ```

See [Advanced Topics - Selecting Tests](advanced.md#selecting-tests) for details.

---

## How do I temporarily disable a test without deleting its code?

Prefix the test or test suite name with `DISABLED_`.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MySuite, DISABLED_TestFeature) {
  // This test will be skipped.
}
```

You can run disabled tests explicitly with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

This approach avoids code rot and helps manage flaky or incomplete tests.

More at [Advanced Topics - Temporarily Disabling Tests](advanced.md#temporarily-disabling-tests).

---

## What do I do if a death test hangs or segfaults?

Death tests run code in a child process to capture abnormal exits. Common causes of hangs include thread-related issues.

To fix:

- Make sure no competing threads run before the death test.
- Try setting death test style to `threadsafe`:

  ```cpp
  GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
  ```

- Move initialization inside the death test when possible.

See [Advanced Topics - Death Tests and Threads](advanced.md#death-tests-and-threads) and [Getting Started Troubleshooting](getting-started/troubleshooting-getting-started/common-setup-issues) for details.

---

## How can I add additional context to assertion failure messages?

Use `<<` to stream custom messages into assertions:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(x, y) << "Values differed at iteration " << i;
```

Or use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual traces for failures within a scope:

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Iteration " + std::to_string(i));
EXPECT_EQ(foo, bar);
```

For more detailed control over messages, see predicate assertions and predicate-formatters in [Advanced Topics - More Assertions](advanced.md#more-assertions).

---

## Where can I get more help when stuck?

- Visit the [Getting Started Troubleshooting](getting-started/troubleshooting-getting-started/common-setup-issues) for common errors and fixes.
- Explore [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) for beginner-friendly guidance.
- Consult the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) for full assertion capabilities.
- Check GitHub issues, community forums, and the [GoogleTest official documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for ongoing support.
