# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This guide addresses the most frequent problems users encounter when installing and configuring GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It offers clear solutions for compiler compatibility, missing headers, linking errors, and environment-specific complications, helping you quickly resolve setup blockers and get back to writing and running tests.

---

## 1. Compiler Compatibility Issues

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler. Before building, verify your compiler version:

- **GCC**: Minimum version 7.1
- **Clang**: Minimum version 5.0
- **MSVC**: Visual Studio 2017 or newer

If your environment uses an older compiler, update to a supported version or install a compatible toolchain.

### How to Check Compiler Version

```bash
gcc --version
clang --version
cl  # For MSVC (via Developer Command Prompt)
```

### Common Pitfalls

- Using a compiler build defaulting to a lower C++ standard may cause cryptic errors. Explicitly specify C++17 support in your build setup, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or `/std:c++17` for MSVC.
- Older versions of Bazel or CMake might not support C++17 properly; upgrade your build tools accordingly.

<Tip>
Define your compiler flags to enforce C++17 to avoid unexpected build failures.
</Tip>

## 2. Missing Header Files

Errors such as `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory` indicate that your build system cannot locate GoogleTest headers.

### Solutions:

- **Verify Include Paths**: Ensure your build system includes the GoogleTest headers path (`googletest/include`).
- **If Using CMake:**
  - Use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` and link your targets with `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gtest_main`.
  - Or add GoogleTest as a subdirectory and link with `gtest`/`gtest_main`.
- **Manual Builds:** Include `-I/path/to/googletest/include` in your compiler command.

### Example: CMake Usage

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)
```

<Tip>
For embedded or manual build setups, explicitly specify include directories for both GoogleTest and GoogleMock (if used).
</Tip>

---

## 3. Linking Errors

Linker errors such as `undefined reference to testing::InitGoogleTest()` happen when your test binary is not linked with the GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries.

### How to Fix Linking Issues:

- **Link with `gtest` and/or `gtest_main` libraries:**
  - `gtest` is the core library.
  - `gtest_main` provides a ready-made `main()` function implementation.

- **GoogleMock:** If you use mocking features, link against `gmock` and `gmock_main`.

### Example: Link Libraries Using GCC

```bash
g++ my_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -lpthread -o my_test
```

### CMake Example

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE gtest gtest_main)
```

### If Using GoogleMock

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_mock_test PRIVATE gmock gmock_main)
```

<Warning>
Link `pthread` on POSIX systems if you encounter unresolved pthread symbols.
</Warning>

## 4. Environment-Specific Pitfalls

Certain platforms and build environments require special attention.

### Windows

- Ensure consistent runtime libraries between your tests and GoogleTest (dynamic vs static CRT). See the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option.
- If you encounter MSVC-specific linking errors, confirm you've linked `gtest_main` or provided your own `main()` function.

### Unix-like Systems

- Missing `-pthread` linker flag causes linking errors related to thread support.
- GoogleTest requires pthread support for thread safety. Add `-pthread` to both compile and link flags.

### Embedded Platforms

- Platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, and Arduino use custom `setup()` and `loop()` functions instead of `main()`.
- GoogleTest initializes via `InitGoogleTest()` within `setup()`. Ensure your test runner is adapted accordingly.

## 5. CMake and Build Configuration Tips

- To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock using CMake, a recommended flow is:

  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install  # optional
  ```

- To omit building GoogleMock when it is not needed, configure with:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
  ```

- Set `gtest_force_shared_crt` ON in CMake to fix runtime mismatches on Windows.

- Use `FetchContent` or submodule to tightly integrate GoogleTest in your project.

<Tip>
Ensure your C++ standard is set to 17 or greater in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Error Messages

### Example 1: `undefined reference to testing::InitGoogleTest()`

**Cause:** Missing linkage to `gtest` or `gtest_main`.

**Fix:** Link your test target against the appropriate libraries, e.g., `-lgtest -lgtest_main`.

### Example 2: `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory`

**Cause:** Compiler not finding GoogleTest headers.

**Fix:** Add GoogleTest include directory to compiler flags.

### Example 3: `LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'`

**Cause:** Mismatch between Visual Studio CRT linkage settings.

**Fix:** Use CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` or adjust your project runtime library to match GoogleTest.

### Example 4: `missing pthread symbols`

**Cause:** Forgetting to link with pthread.

**Fix:** Add `-pthread` to both compiler and linker flags.

## 7. Validation and Next Steps

Once you resolve installation and build problems:

- Verify with a simple, minimal test program that compiles and runs.
- Use the provided `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries to handle the `main()` entry point.
- Start writing your first tests using the [Writing Your First Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/gtest-getting-started.html) guide.

<Check>
Run your tests with `./your_test_binary` and ensure it executes all tests and reports results without errors.
</Check>
