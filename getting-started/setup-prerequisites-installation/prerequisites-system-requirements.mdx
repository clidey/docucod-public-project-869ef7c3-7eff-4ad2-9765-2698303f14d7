# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Prepare to build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively by ensuring your development environment meets the following essential requirements. This page guides you through the necessary compiler versions, language standards, supported platforms, and toolchain settings crucial for a successful setup.

---

## 1. Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest demands a modern C++ environment to leverage advanced language features and ensure portability:

- **Minimum C++ Standard**: C++17 must be supported and enabled in your compiler settings.
  - Verify your project or build system enforces at least C++17 with flags like `-std=c++17` (GCC/Clang) or appropriate MSVC settings.
  - Note: Builds will **fail** if the compiler does not support C++17 due to mandatory language features used by GoogleTest.

- **Supported Compilers**:
  - Recent versions of **GCC**, **Clang/LLVM**, and **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** are supported.
  - Other compilers compatible with C++17 may work but are not guaranteed without testing.

- **Exception Handling and RTTI**:
  - GoogleTest detects and requires exception support; disabling exceptions will disable some features.
  - Run-time Type Information (RTTI) support is detected and encouraged for full functionality.

### Practical Tips

- To ensure C++17 is enabled in CMake, add to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- When building manually, pass the right compiler flag:

  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 ...
  ```

- If you encounter build errors related to language features, double-check your C++ standard setting.

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and follows Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. It supports a wide range of operating systems:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly**
- **Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS**
- **Android** (as a variant of Linux)
- **iOS** (limited support)

For a detailed and up-to-date compatibility matrix, consult the official supported platforms list:

[GoogleTest Supported Platforms Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

### Platform Detection

GoogleTest automatically detects the compiling platform via compiler macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, etc., enabling platform-specific adaptations internally.

---

## 3. Toolchain and Build System Requirements

GoogleTest integrates well with common C++ build systems and toolchains:

- **Build Tools**:
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (recommended, supports cross-platform builds)
  - GNU Make, Ninja
  - Visual Studio solutions on Windows

- **Threading Support**:
  - GoogleTest detects pthread availability via `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`.
  - On Windows, native threading support is used.

- **pkg-config Files**:
  - GoogleTest provides `.pc` pkg-config files which supply compile and link flags.
  - Ensure your pkg-config path is correctly set if using GoogleTest installed outside standard system paths.

### Cross-Compilation Notes

- When cross-compiling, properly set environment variables such as `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` and `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` to point pkg-config to the correct sysroot.

---

## 4. Environment and Permissions

- **Build Permissions**: Administrative or appropriate build user permissions are recommended for installation steps that place libraries and headers in system-wide locations.

- **Network Access**: Required if downloading dependencies or GoogleTest source during the build process (e.g., via CMake `FetchContent`).

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues and Solutions">

<Accordion title="C++ Standard Not Set or Lower than C++17">
Make sure your compiler flags specify at least `-std=c++17` or equivalent. Without this, you will encounter build failures due to unsupported language features.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pkg-config Files Not Found">
If your build system or environment cannot find GoogleTest's pkg-config files, set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the directory containing `.pc` files, e.g.,

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="pthread Link Errors on Linux/Mac">
Ensure that you link with `-pthread` if using do-it-yourself build scripts. When using CMake, threading dependencies are automatically handled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build Failures Due to Missing Dependencies">
Verify that your compiler, build system, and C++ standard library are compatible and properly installed.
</Accordion>

## 6. Verification

After setting up your environment, verify prerequisites:

- **Check compiler version** and C++ standard support:

  ```bash
  g++ --version
  ```

- **Check installed packages** and paths:

  For pkg-config:

  ```bash
  pkg-config --cflags gtest
  pkg-config --libs gtest
  ```

- **Run a simple test case** following the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and [Quickstart CMake guide](quickstart-cmake.md) to confirm successful compilation and execution.

<Tip>
Ensuring your environment fulfills these prerequisites prevents the majority of build and runtime issues with GoogleTest. Always verify your compiler supports C++17 and set necessary flags early in your build configuration.
</Tip>

<Note>
If targeting non-mainstream platforms or embedded environments, checking internal macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` or `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` can help tailor GoogleTest's behavior accordingly.
