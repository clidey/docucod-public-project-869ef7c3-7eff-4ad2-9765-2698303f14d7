# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Welcome to GoogleTest! Before installing and building GoogleTest, ensure that your development environment meets all the foundational requirements. This page will help you verify system compatibility, required software dependencies, and essential configuration details needed for a smooth setup.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform with official support for the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (most popular distributions)  
- **Windows** (including Windows 10 and later)  
- **Mac OS X**

The framework also provides limited support for embedded and specialized platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, and QURT.

> For detailed and up-to-date compatibility info, review the [Supported Platforms](platforms.md) documentation.

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler with support for **at least C++17** standard features.

### Recommended Compiler Versions:

| Operating System | Compiler                  | Minimum Version |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Linux/macOS      | GCC                       | 7.0 or higher   |
| Linux/macOS      | Clang                     | 5.0 or higher   |
| Windows          | Visual Studio             | 2017 or higher  |

> Note: If you use other compilers, verify they have stable C++17 support before proceeding.

### How to Check Your Compiler Version

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
# Check GCC version
gcc --version

# Check Clang version
clang --version

# Check Visual Studio (Developer Command Prompt)
cl
```

If your compiler does not support C++17, upgrade to a supported version.

## 3. C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest mandates C++17 support to build and run tests successfully.

Ensure your build system or compilation command includes the following flags:

- For CMake projects, add to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If you are compiling manually, use:
  ```bash
  -std=c++17
  ```

Failure to specify C++17 will cause build errors.

## 4. Software Dependencies

- **Build tool**: GoogleTest supports various build systems, but CMake is recommended for cross-platform ease.
  - Install CMake version **3.14 or higher**.
  - Other build tools like Make, Ninja, or Visual Studio can be used alongside CMake-generated files.

- **Git**: Required for cloning the GoogleTest source.

- **Thread Library**:
  - On *nix systems, pthread support is necessary for thread-safe tests.
  - CMake usually detects and configures pthread automatically.


## 5. Checking Your Environment

Confirm you have all essentials:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Operating System">
Check your OS version and architecture to confirm compatibility with GoogleTest (Linux, Windows, Mac).
</Step>
<Step title="Verify C++ Compiler and Version">
Run the compiler version commands shown above to confirm C++17 support.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify CMake Installation">
Run `cmake --version` to confirm CMake is installed and meets the minimum version (3.14+).
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Git Installation">
Run `git --version`.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify pthread Support (Linux/macOS)">
Ensure the pthread development libraries are available (typically installed by default). If not, install them via your package manager.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Environment Configuration Tips

- Ensure your PATH environment variable includes paths to your compiler binaries, CMake, and Git for easy command-line access.

- On Windows, if you use Visual Studio, install the "Desktop development with C++" workload through the Visual Studio Installer.

- When building with CMake on Windows, prefer the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for consistency.

## 7. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<Tip>
If facing linker errors related to pthreads on Linux/macOS, confirm that CMake has correctly found pthread by checking the build output or explicitly linking pthread with `-lpthread`.
</Tip>
<Warning>
On Windows, mixing dynamic and static runtimes (e.g., dynamic CRT for your project but static CRT for GoogleTest libraries) causes linker errors. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to harmonize runtime linkage.
</Warning>
<Note>
GoogleTest will fail to build if your compiler or build environment does not support C++17 fully. In some cases, setting compiler flags manually (`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`) can help specify this.
</Note>

## 8. Verifying Your Environment Is Ready

Once you have installed and configured the prerequisites, you can verify readiness by:

1. Running `cmake --version` to confirm CMake availability.
2. Running `g++ -std=c++17 --version` (or analogous for your compiler) to confirm C++17 support.
3. Cloning the GoogleTest repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
display googletest directory contents.
```

4. Building a simple GoogleTest example (instructions available in Installation and Quickstart guides).

Successful completion of these steps proves your environment meets all requirements.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to the [Installation (CMake & Bazel)](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installation-integration) guide to build and install GoogleTest.

- Refer to the [Configuration & Validation](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/configuration-validation) page to fine-tune your setup.

- Explore the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) to learn how to write your first tests.
