# System Requirements for GoogleTest

Ensure your development environment meets the prerequisites below to build and use GoogleTest reliably across different platforms and configurations.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports major desktop and server operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (including Windows Mobile in some cases)
- **macOS**
- **Embedded platforms:** Arduino variants like ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52

The project aligns with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support);
for detailed, up-to-date platform compatibility, consult the [Supported Platforms & Compatibility](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation and support matrix available online.

<Check>
Always verify your target platform and compiler against Google's official maintained support matrix.
</Check>

---

## 2. Required C++ Compiler Support

GoogleTest requires an environment with proper C++17 support. To guarantee successful compilation:

- Use a compiler with **full C++17 standard adherence**.
- On CMake builds, specify the C++ standard explicitly to avoid compatibility issues:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- Supported compiler versions are generally modern releases of GCC, Clang, and MSVC. Detailed compiler support is governed per platform as indicated in the foundational support documentation.

### MSVC Specifics

- Minimum **Visual C++ 2015 (VC++ 14.0)** is required to compile GoogleMock (part of GoogleTest).
- Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if you encounter linker errors related to runtime library mismatches.

### Multi-threading Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where pthreads is available.
- On Windows or other pthread-less environments, thread safety is more limited. Adjust your expectations accordingly.

<Note>
For cross-platform multi-threaded tests, ensure your environment's thread library is supported, or disable multi-threading if necessary.
</Note>

---

## 3. Build Tools and Dependencies

### CMake

GoogleTest uses CMake as its primary build system with versions **3.14 or newer** recommended, since it leverages modern CMake features like `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`.

- Download the latest CMake version from <https://cmake.org/>.
- For building GoogleTest alone or incorporating it into your project, CMake simplifies configuration and ensures portability.

### Additional Tools

- **Make** on Linux/macOS after CMake generates Makefiles.
- **Visual Studio** solution files generated automatically for Windows users.
- **Xcode** project files for macOS users.

<Check>
Ensure your build system respects compiler flags and runtime libraries to avoid linkage or runtime errors.
</Check>

---

## 4. Platform and Compiler Configuration

GoogleTest's build scripts auto-detect pthread availability and set relevant compiler flags:

- On platforms with pthread, `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` is defined.
- On others, `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` disables pthread-specific features.

**Compiler flags include strict warning options and runtime configuration:**

- MSVC:
  - Enables `/W4` (high warning level)
  - Enforces static or dynamic CRT linkage based on build options
  - Uses UTF-8 source encoding flag (`-utf-8`)

- GCC/Clang/IntelLLVM:
  - Uses `-Wall -Wshadow` and other warnings
  - Configures exception and RTTI behavior via appropriate flags

<Warning>
Improper compiler flags may cause build failures or subtle runtime bugs. Use provided CMake options to manage these settings rather than overriding manually.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Runtime Dependencies

- GoogleTest itself has no runtime external dependencies beyond the standard C++ library.
- If you enable multi-threaded tests, your environment must support pthreads or equivalent threading libraries.

---

## 6. Summary: Ensuring Reliability

Confirm these key points before building GoogleTest:

- Your OS and compiler are supported (consult the foundational C++ support policy).
- C++17 standard is enabled explicitly in your build system.
- CMake version is 3.14 or higher for integration features.
- Threading library availability matches your test requirements.

<Info>
Following these requirements lets you build GoogleTest cleanly and run your C++ tests consistently across platforms.

## 7. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Requirement Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Supporting C++17">
If you get errors about unsupported C++ features, verify your compiler version and explicitly enable C++17 support in your build configuration.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread Linking Errors on Linux">
Make sure your compiler/linker flags include `-pthread`. If using CMake, it handles this automatically when pthreads are detected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows with MSVC">
Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to align your project's runtime library with GoogleTest's.
See the build instructions for enabling this in your `cmake` command.
