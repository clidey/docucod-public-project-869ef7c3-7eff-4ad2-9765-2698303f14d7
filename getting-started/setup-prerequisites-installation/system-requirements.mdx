# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is a widely adopted C++ testing framework designed with portability and flexibility in mind. To ensure smooth installation and use, it is crucial to verify that your development environment meets specific system, compiler, and tooling requirements. This guide details the supported platforms, compilers, and toolchains for GoogleTest, enabling you to confirm compatibility before proceeding with installation.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a broad range of operating systems commonly used for C++ development. Verify that your target OS aligns with one of the following:

- **Linux** (including distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)
- **Windows** (desktop variants including MSVC and MinGW toolchains)
- **Mac OS X** (macOS)
- **Embedded and Special Platforms** (select embedded Linux, BSD variants, and others with POSIX compliance)

<Check>
Make sure your OS has file system support and standard development tools to facilitate the build.
</Check>

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler to build and run correctly. The following compilers and minimal versions are supported:

| Compiler           | Minimum Version                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| GCC                | 7.0 or later                  |
| Clang              | 5.0 or later                  |
| Microsoft Visual C++| Visual Studio 2017 (VS 15.0) |
| Intel C++ Compiler  | Versions supporting C++17     |

<Info>
Older compilers not supporting C++17 are incompatible. Attempting to build with these will result in build errors.
</Info>

### Compiler Features Required

- Full support for C++17 standard features.
- Support for exception handling (exceptions can be disabled but some GoogleTest features depend on them).
- RTTI support is recommended but not mandatory.

## 3. Toolchain and Build Tools

GoogleTest supports multiple build systems and methods, such as CMake and Bazel. To successfully build:

- **CMake**: Minimum recommended version is 3.14 for smooth integration and modern feature support.
- **Bazel**: Supported as an alternative build system (see the Bazel-specific installation guides).
- Standard tools like **make** on Linux/macOS or **MSBuild** on Windows for native builds.

<Note>
Ensure that your PATH environment variable includes the tools’ binaries and that they are accessible at the command line.
</Note>

## 4. Required Libraries and Dependencies

GoogleTest has minimal dependencies and aims to be self-contained. However:

- The POSIX thread library (`pthread`) is utilized on platforms where available (
  Linux, macOS) to enable thread-related features and parallel test execution.
- Windows threading support is integrated via native Windows APIs.
- Abseil and RE2 libraries are optional and used only if GoogleTest is configured with Abseil support.

<Tip>
In rare cases, if POSIX threads are unavailable or disabled, GoogleTest will run in a single-threaded mode but remains functional.
</Tip>

## 5. Platform Specific Notes

- **Windows**:
  - Visual Studio 2017 or later is required.
  - MinGW compilers are supported but require careful configuration.
  - Runtime libraries linking must be consistent; GoogleTest provides options for shared/static CRT linkage.

- **macOS**:
  - Compatible with recent releases supporting C++17.
  - Xcode command line tools should be installed.

- **Linux**:
  - Distribution and kernel versions are generally not a restriction as long as standard compilers and libraries are in place.
  - Ensure compatibility of the pthread library if running multi-threaded tests.

- **Embedded Platforms**:
  - Support is available but depends on POSIX compliance.
  - May require custom configuration.

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

### Check Compiler Version

Run your compiler’s version command to verify C++17 support.

```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version

# Clang example
clang --version

# MSVC
cl
```

Ensure the version corresponds with or exceeds the minimum requirements.

### Check CMake Version

```bash
cmake --version
```

### Sample C++17 Support Test

Create a simple `test.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <optional>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::optional<int> val = 42;
    if (val.has_value()) {
        std::cout << "C++17 is supported" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
```

Compile it with your compiler. Successful compilation and output confirm C++17 support.

## 7. Common Incompatibility Pitfalls

<Warning>
- Using an outdated compiler that lacks C++17 support.
- Mismatched runtime library settings on Windows (e.g., mixing static and dynamic CRT linkage).
- Missing or broken dependencies like pthread on Unix systems.
- Incorrect tool versions or missing toolchain executables in PATH.
</Warning>
