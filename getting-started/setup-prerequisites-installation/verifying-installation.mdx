# Verifying Your Installation

Quickly ensure that GoogleTest is properly set up on your system by running a minimal end-to-end test. This page guides you through compiling and executing a simple test program so you can confirm your environment is ready and focus on writing effective tests.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before verifying your installation, ensure the following:

- **GoogleTest library and headers are installed** on your system per the [Installing GoogleTest](./installing-googletest) guide.
- Your development environment supports C++17 or later.
- You have a compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC) and build system (like CMake).
- Linker is configured to link against GoogleTest (either `gtest` or `gtest_main`).


## 2. Minimal Test Example

Use this simple C++ test code to verify the setup. This test checks the factorial of 0 and 1 returning 1, demonstrating GoogleTest’s basic functionality.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple factorial function to test.
int Factorial(int n) {
    return (n <= 1) ? 1 : n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

// Test suite named FactorialTest.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesOneInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
}

// Entry point, runs all the tests.
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

> Save this code as `simple_test.cpp`.

## 3. Compiling the Test

### Using g++ (Linux/macOS)

```bash
c++ -std=c++17 -isystem /usr/local/include -pthread simple_test.cpp -L/usr/local/lib -lgtest_main -lgtest -o simple_test
```

- Adjust `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib` if your GoogleTest is installed elsewhere.

### Using CMake

1. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(SimpleTest)

find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(simple_test simple_test.cpp)

target_link_libraries(simple_test GTest::gtest_main)

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME simple_test COMMAND simple_test)
```

2. Build and run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

This process will build and execute your test.

### On Windows (Visual Studio Command Prompt)

Use your configured environment and run:

```batch
cl /EHsc /I path\to\googletest\include simple_test.cpp /link path\to\googletest\lib\gtest_main.lib path\to\googletest\lib\gtest.lib
simple_test.exe
```

Ensure you replace `path\to\googletest` with the actual GoogleTest install path.

## 4. Running Your Test

- Execute the compiled binary:

```bash
./simple_test
```

- Expected output snippet on success:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesOneInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesOneInput
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

- If the tests fail, the output will show the failed assertions with detailed messages.

## 5. Confirming Success

Your GoogleTest installation is correctly set up if:

- The test binary compiles and links without errors.
- Running the tests results in no failures or crashes.
- You see `[  PASSED  ]` message for all tests.

Otherwise, you need to verify:

- GoogleTest build and installation steps.
- Include and library paths during compilation.
- Compiler compatibility and standard version.

## 6. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Verification Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compilation errors: missing headers or libs">
Check the include and library paths. Ensure GoogleTest headers and libraries are installed and accessible. Confirm the correct library names (`libgtest.a`, `libgtest_main.a` or their dynamic equivalents).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors about unresolved symbols">
Make sure you link with both `gtest` and `gtest_main` (or implement your own `main()`). On some systems, thread support is needed; add `-pthread` on Linux/macOS.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime errors or test crashes">
Verify that your environment matches GoogleTest requirements (C++17 support, compatible compiler). Disable conflicting GoogleTest flags or run with `--gtest_break_on_failure` to diagnose failures.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests do not run or appear to be skipped">
Check if tests are disabled using prefixes like `DISABLED_`. Verify filter settings with `--gtest_filter`, and ensure tests are not filtered out.
