# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Understanding the prerequisites and system requirements is essential to successfully build and run tests using GoogleTest. This document outlines the necessary environment, tools, and software versions needed to ensure smooth integration and usage.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a broad range of operating systems including:

- Linux distributions
- macOS
- Windows (including Desktop, MinGW, and variants)

For detailed platform support and compatibility, see the [Supported Platforms](../platforms.md) page.

> Note: While GoogleTest targets many platforms, the most stable support is provided for Cygwin, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## 2. C++ Compiler Requirements

To compile GoogleTest, your environment must have a C++ compiler that supports:

- At least C++17 standard (C++ language features as per 2017 are mandatory)

GoogleTest automatically enforces this and will produce an error message if your compiler is not compatible.

### Recommended Compilers:

- GCC 7.0 or later
- Clang 5.0 or later
- MSVC 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) or later


## 3. Build Tools

GoogleTest uses CMake as its primary build system. You will require:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.13 or newer (minimum required version varies slightly depending on usage; 3.14+ recommended for `FetchContent` usage)
- A compatible build tool such as:
  - Make
  - Ninja
  - Visual Studio Build Tools (on Windows)

See [Quickstart: Building with CMake](../docs/quickstart-cmake.md) for instructions on how to build GoogleTest using CMake.

> **Tip:** If you don't have CMake installed, follow the [official CMake installation guide](https://cmake.org/install).

## 4. Environment and System Settings

- Ensure that your system PATH includes the compiler and build tools.
- On Windows, if using MSVC, verify that you have the necessary Windows SDK components.
- For multi-threaded test safety, a platform supporting POSIX threads (`pthreads`) or Windows threading is recommended.

## 5. Network and Dependency Requirements

- If you use CMake's `FetchContent` to download the GoogleTest sources automatically, an active internet connection during the build configuration step is required.
- Alternatively, you can clone the GoogleTest repository manually to avoid network dependencies during builds.

## 6. Summary of Key System Requirements

| Requirement              | Details                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System         | Linux, macOS, Windows (Desktop, MinGW)                                                      |
| Compiler                 | C++ compiler with C++17 support (e.g., GCC >=7, Clang >=5, MSVC 2017 Update 3)              |
| Build System             | CMake 3.13 or higher (3.14+ recommended)                                                    |
| Build Tools              | Compatible tools such as Make, Ninja, or Visual Studio Build Tools                           |
| Network                  | Internet connection required if using CMake's `FetchContent` to download dependencies       |

## 7. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Explicitly set the C++ standard in your build scripts:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- When building on Windows with Visual Studio, consider setting the option `gtest_force_shared_crt` ON in your CMake configuration to avoid runtime library mismatch errors.

- Validate that your compiler can compile basic C++17 code independently to isolate issues early.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

- **Compiler Errors Related to C++ Version**: Confirm that your compiler invocation includes the flag to use C++17, such as `-std=c++17`.

- **Missing CMake or Older CMake Version**: Upgrade CMake to at least version 3.13; older versions may not support required features.

- **Runtime Library Mismatches on Windows**: Activate `gtest_force_shared_crt` in your CMakeLists if you encounter linker complaints about the runtime.

- **Unavailable Pthread Support**: On platforms lacking pthreads, GoogleTest may disable multi-threading features. Check the macro `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` manually if issues arise.
