# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

This guide outlines the essential system requirements and platform compatibility necessary to build, install, and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock successfully. Understanding these requirements ensures a smooth setup experience and enables proper integration with your development environment.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest mandates a minimum of **C++17** support from your compiler. Attempting to build with earlier standards will result in errors, as specified in the core header files.

- **Key Check**: The code validates that the detected C++ language version is at least C++17.
- **Supported Compiler Flags**:
  - For CMake projects, specify:
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```
  - Alternatively, use compiler-specific flags, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang.

<Tip>
Attempting to compile with older standards will fail at compile-time with an explicit error. Ensure your toolchain supports C++17 before proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems & Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide range of operating systems based on Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). The main supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (with various distributions)
- **Windows** (including Desktop, MinGW, and Windows Store/RT variants)
- **macOS** (including Darwin and iOS for some feature compatibility)
- **POSIX-compliant Unix systems** such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris
- Other specialized platforms include QNX, Haiku, and embedded systems like ESP8266, ESP32

Detailed platform detection macros internally distinguish these, allowing GoogleTest to fine-tune feature availability.

### Platform Detection Examples (Internal Macros)
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`
- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`
- `GTEST_OS_MAC`
- `GTEST_OS_IOS`
- `GTEST_OS_CYGWIN`

<Tip>
While many platforms are supported, core team members primarily maintain Linux, Windows, and macOS support. If you encounter issues on less common platforms, contributions and patches are welcome.
</Tip>

## 3. Supported Compiler Versions

While specific supported compiler versions evolve, GoogleTest requires:

- A compiler fully supporting **C++17** features
- Examples of widely tested compilers include:
  - GCC 7.0 and above
  - Clang 5.0 and above
  - MSVC 2017 Update 3 (_MSC_VER >= 1911_)

For exact compiler compatibility, consult [Google’s foundational C++ support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

<Tip>
In rare cases where the compiler does not automatically enable exceptions or RTTI, or has limited support for certain features, you may need to adjust build flags or define macros such as `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=1`.
</Tip>

## 4. Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest uses threading primitives where available, enabling thread-safe test execution.

- **POSIX threads (`pthread`)** support is enabled on typical Unix-like systems.
- **Windows native threading** is supported on Windows platforms.
- If thread support is unavailable or explicitly disabled, GoogleTest behaves as single-threaded.

## 5. Compiler and Build Tools Compatibility

GoogleTest is intended to integrate smoothly with modern build tools:

- **CMake**: GoogleTest provides CMakeLists suitable for a wide range of platforms and compilers.
- **Pkg-config**: Preconfigured files exist for easier flag management.
- **Make**: On Unix-like systems, building with `make` is supported.
- **Visual Studio**: Solutions and project files are generated automatically by CMake on Windows.

## 6. Platform Feature Macros and Tweaks

The internal headers define macros reflecting platform capabilities such as:

- Exception support (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`)
- POSIX regex availability (`GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`)
- Stream redirection support (`GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`)
- Death test support (`GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`)
- RTTI availability (`GTEST_HAS_RTTI`)

These macros adjust GoogleTest’s behavior to best suit the platform and environment.

<Tip>
Users generally do not need to define these macros manually. They are detected automatically but can be overridden for specific needs.
</Tip>

## 7. Additional Platform Notes

- On embedded or mobile platforms (such as Windows RT, Windows Phone, ESP8266), some GoogleTest features like stream redirection or death tests are disabled due to platform constraints.
- File system and environment variable support may be limited on some embedded platforms.

## 8. How to Check Your Build Environment Compatibility

You can check available platform macros by inspecting the preprocessor output or consulting `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` to verify if threading is enabled.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  std::cout << "GoogleTest is thread-safe: " << GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE << std::endl;
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue: Build failing due to unsupported C++ standard

- Ensure your compiler supports C++17.
- Confirm that your build system enables C++17, e.g., CMake with `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`.

### Common Issue: GoogleTest does not detect threading support

- Explicitly enable pthread in compiler flags with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.
- Verify linkage with pthread library (`-lpthread`).

### Common Issue: Missing platform-specific features

- Some platforms may disable features like death tests or stream redirection.
- Verify which platform macros are defined in your environment.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Always use the latest stable compiler version with C++17 support for best compatibility.
- Use the official GoogleTest CMake build system to manage platform-specific quirks.
- When cross-compiling, ensure pkg-config paths and environment variables reflect your target sysroot.
- Consult the official platform support links for updates and detailed environment matrices.

By aligning your development environment with these requirements, you ensure reliable builds and execution of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, enabling robust C++ test automation.
