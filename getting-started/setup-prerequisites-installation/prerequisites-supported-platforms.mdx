# Prerequisites and Supported Platforms

Before installing GoogleTest and GoogleMock, it is critical to ensure your development environment meets all foundational dependencies and platform requirements. This preparation prevents common blockers during installation and compilation and guarantees smooth integration.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a development environment that supports at minimum **C++17**. This is a strict prerequisite:

- Compilers targeting earlier C++ standards (C++14, C++11, etc.) are **not supported**.
- You must configure your build system to use C++17 or later.

### How to ensure C++17 support

- For CMake projects, set:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- For direct compiler invocations, use flags:
  - GCC or Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - MSVC: `/std:c++17`

### Why C++17?

GoogleTest leverages modern language features to provide robust and efficient testing capabilities. This enables cleaner APIs, better type safety, and improved performance.

<Note>
Using a compiler that does not meet C++17 support will result in immediate build errors and is unsupported.
</Note>

---

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest has verified support for the following compiler versions and environments:

| Compiler       | Minimum Version   | Notes                                    |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GCC            | 7.0+             | Full C++17 compliance expected           |
| Clang          | 5.0+             | Full C++17 compliance expected           |
| MSVC           | Visual Studio 2017 (15.3+) | At least VS 2015 for GoogleMock compilation |

### Compiler Version Check for GoogleMock

- GoogleMock requires MS Visual C++ **2015 or later** (corresponding to `_MSC_VER >= 1900`).
- Attempting to build with earlier MSVC versions will trigger an explicit compile-time error:

  ```
  #error "At least Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is required to compile Google Mock."
  ```

## 3. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of platforms, consistent with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the [Supported Platforms matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md). Supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (including Android)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile variants)
- **Mac OS X and iOS**
- **BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly)**
- **Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS**
- Embedded and special platforms such as **ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52, Xtensa, Qurt** (with some limitations)

<Info>
Platform detection is automatic via internal macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`), enabling platform-specific optimizations and adjustments.
</Info>

### Unsupported or Limited Platforms

Some embedded or specialized platforms have limited or no support for features like filesystem access or threading. Verify compatibility in your target environment.

---

## 4. Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms where threading APIs such as **pthreads** or equivalent are available.

- Thread safety is enabled by default on most UNIX-like systems and Windows Desktop (non-mobile).
- The macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` will be 1 if thread safety is active.
- For environments where pthreads is unavailable or disabled, GoogleTest falls back to dummy synchronization primitives and is not thread-safe.

### Forcing Threading Support

If automatic detection fails, use compiler flags to explicitly enable or disable pthread support:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable pthreads
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable pthreads
```

---

## 5. Build System Considerations

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock can be built using **CMake**, which manages platform detection and compiler options.
- By default, **GoogleMock will be built together with GoogleTest**.
- To build only GoogleTest, use the CMake option `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.
- CMake projects should set the C++ standard to C++17 or higher to satisfy requirements.

Examples:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=ON
make
```

- For integration with existing build systems, ensure that the compiler, flags, and platform are compatible with C++17 and the required platform macros.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Recommendations

- **Use a supported compiler version:** Older compilers lacking C++17 support will fail.
- **Set your compiler and build flags explicitly** to avoid ambiguity in C++ version.
- **Verify platform macros** if targeting less common or embedded platforms.
- **Avoid mixing runtime libraries** (especially on Windows) to prevent linker errors.
