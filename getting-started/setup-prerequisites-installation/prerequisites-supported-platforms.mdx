# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

GoogleTest requires specific system environments, compiler versions, and dependencies to function seamlessly. This page provides a clear checklist of prerequisites concerning C++ standards, supported systems, compilers, and dependencies. Use this to verify compatibility before installing or integrating GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest mandates support for **C++17 or later**. This ensures access to modern language features and standard libraries critical for reliability and maintainability.

- **Enforcement:**
  - When using CMake, ensure you set:
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```
  - If not possible in your build system, specify C++17 flags explicitly (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).
- Attempts to compile GoogleTest with older C++ standards will fail with an error similar to:
  ```
  #error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
  ```

<Tip>
Make sure your compiler toolchain fully supports C++17 features to avoid build errors or subtle runtime issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of platforms, following [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Below are key supported platforms:

| Operating System           | Notes                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows Desktop           | Native MSVC, MinGW supported                           |
| Linux                     | Mainline distributions with GCC/Clang                  |
| macOS                     | Including recent versions with Clang                   |
| FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD  | Supported with standard toolchains                      |
| Solaris, AIX              | Partially supported; verify toolchain compatibility    |
| Android                   | Supported on Android API level 9 and above             |
| QNX, Fuchsia              | Not officially supported, limited compatibility        |

<Note>
Support for Windows Mobile, Windows Store App (WinRT), embedded systems like ESP32, ESP8266, or niche OSes (e.g. Haiku, GNU/Hurd) is not officially guaranteed.
</Note>

## 3. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires C++17 support. The following compilers and versions are known to work:

| Compiler              | Minimum Version    | Notes                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| MSVC                  | Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer | Older MSVC versions (pre-2015) are not supported. Explicit check rejects MSVC versions < 1900. |
| GCC                   | 7.0.0 or newer     | Supports C++17 fully                             |
| Clang                 | 3.9+              | Full C++17 support recommended                   |
| IntelLLVM             | Compatible if supports C++17 features             |
| SunPro, IBM VisualAge | Partial support; confirm C++17 features           |

<Warning>
Compiling GoogleMock (part of GoogleTest) with MSVC versions older than Visual Studio 2015 (MSVC 14.0) will fail with an error.
</Warning>

## 4. Platform-Specific Considerations

- **POSIX Threads:**
  - GoogleTest is thread-safe when pthreads are available.
  - On some platforms (Linux, macOS), pthreads are automatically detected.
  - On Windows, native threading primitives are used.
  - User can override detection with compile flags:
    - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to force pthread support
    - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to disable pthreads

- **Stream Redirection & Death Tests:** Certain platforms do not support stream redirection or death tests (e.g., Windows Mobile, embedded platforms).

- **Wide String Support:** Some platforms lack full `std::wstring` support which may affect Unicode test cases.

## 5. Required Dependencies

GoogleTest is largely self-contained but has the following dependencies depending on configuration:

- **C++ Standard Library:** Fully C++17 compliant standard library
- **Build Tools:**
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.13 or later recommended for build configuration
  - Compiler toolchain meeting prerequisites
- **Optional:**
  - [Abseil](https://abseil.io/) libraries if built with Abseil support (enables advanced flags and regex integration)
  - RE2 regex library when Abseil is enabled

## 6. Typical System Requirements

| Requirement       | Recommendation                |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Operating System  | One from supported platforms  |
| Compiler          | Compatible C++17 compiler     |
| Disk Space        | At least 100MB free for source and build output |
| Memory            | Minimum 2GB RAM recommended    |
| Network           | Required for cloning or downloading repositories |

## 7. Checking Your Environment Compatibility

Follow these steps to verify your environment meets GoogleTest's prerequisites:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm C++ Compiler Version and Support">
Run:
```bash
${CXX} --version
```
or in MSVC prompt:
```powershell
cl
```
Ensure version supports C++17.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify pthread availability (on Unix-like systems)">
Try:
```bash
pkg-config --exists pthread && echo 'Pthreads supported' || echo 'Pthreads missing'
```
</Step>
<Step title="Check CMake Version">
Run:
```bash
cmake --version
```
Make sure CMake is 3.13 or higher.
</Step>
<Step title="Operating System Release">
Confirm OS version and compatibility via:
```bash
uname -a
```
(Linux/macOS) or through system info on Windows.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Compatibility Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Error: C++ Version Not Supported">
Ensure your project or build system explicitly sets `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
If using CMake, use `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MSVC Version Too Old">
Only Visual Studio 2015 or later is supported. Earlier versions will trigger build errors.
Upgrade to a supported MSVC version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthreads on Linux/macOS">
Verify that development packages for pthreads are installed. Use system package managers (e.g., `apt-get install build-essential` on Ubuntu).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Related to Runtime Libraries on Windows">
Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align runtime libraries between your project and GoogleTest.
