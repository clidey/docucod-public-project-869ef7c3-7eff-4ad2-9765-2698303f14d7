# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Understand the minimum system requirements, supported operating systems, C++ compiler versions, and platform constraints for GoogleTest. This guide ensures you can confidently prepare your development environment and choose tools that are officially supported and compatible.

---

## 1. Overview
GoogleTest is a powerful, portable C++ testing framework that works across a broad range of platforms and compilers. This page clarifies the officially supported environments, platform-specific constraints, and how to verify your toolchainâ€™s compatibility to ensure smooth building and running of your tests.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems
GoogleTest supports multiple operating systems, primarily focused on common development environments with active platform support:

- **Linux**: Most modern Linux distributions are supported, including Android when targeting native C++ code.
- **macOS**: Support includes macOS and iOS platforms with standard Apple development tools.
- **Windows**:
  - Desktop editions with Visual Studio or MinGW environments.
  - Windows Mobile variants have limited support.
- **UNIX-like systems**: Including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX.
- **Embedded and Special Platforms**: Partial support / experimental on platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, Zephyr RTOS variants.


<Info>
Support coverage and stability are strongest on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Other platforms may vary in support levels; ideally use those with active maintenance.

## 3. Compiler Requirements
GoogleTest requires modern C++ compiler support consistent with the following:

- **C++ Standard**: Full support for **C++17** or later is mandatory.
- **Minimum Compiler Versions (examples):**
  - GCC 7.0 or higher.
  - Clang 5.0 or higher.
  - MSVC 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) or newer.
- **RTTI**: Runtime Type Information (RTTI) support should be enabled in your compiler.
- **Exceptions**: Exception handling support is recommended but can be configured.


<Warning>
Attempting to build GoogleTest with compilers earlier than these minimum versions or with unsupported compiler flags (e.g., disabling RTTI) will cause build failures or runtime issues.
</Warning>

## 4. Platform Constraints & Feature Support

### Threading Support
GoogleTest is thread-safe when the platform provides the **pthread** library or equivalent native threads. On Windows, native Win32 threads are supported. Embedded platforms or mobile versions might lack threading support.

### Filesystem and Stream Redirection
Certain features like death tests and stream capturing require a standard file system and stream redirection support. Platforms without these (some embedded or mobile OS variants) have restricted capabilities.

### Build System Compatibility
- GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with CMake and Bazel.
- For CMake, it requires version 3.14 or higher to leverage features like `FetchContent`.

## 5. Verifying Your Development Environment

### Step 1: Check Your Operating System
Run:

```bash
uname -a
```
or on Windows, check system info in Settings.

### Step 2: Confirm Compiler Version
Run:

```bash
g++ --version
clang++ --version
cl.exe
```
Ensure it meets or exceeds the minimum version requirements listed above.

### Step 3: Confirm C++17 Support
Try compiling a minimal C++17 feature, for example:

```cpp
// test.cpp
#include <variant>
int main() { 
  std::variant<int, float> v = 1; 
  return 0; 
}
```

Compile with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp
```
No errors indicate C++17 support.

### Step 4: Check Threading Support
On UNIX-like

```bash
ld --verbose | grep pthread
```
Or attempt a minimal pthread link test.

On Windows, verify Visual Studio or MinGW setup includes threading libraries.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Compiler Version Too Old">
If your compiler version is older than required:

- Upgrade to a newer compiler version
your system supports.
- On Linux, use package managers to update GCC/Clang.
- On Windows, update Visual Studio or install newer MinGW.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="C++17 Standard Support Issues">
If C++17 features fail to compile:

- Explicitly set your compiler flag `-std=c++17`.
- Ensure no conflicting flags disable modern C++ features.
- Verify build system passes the standard correctly.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Library Not Found">
If errors related to missing pthread or threading symbols occur:

- On Linux or macOS, install `pthread` development packages if missing.
- Add linker flag `-pthread` explicitly.
- On CMake, ensure `find_package(Threads REQUIRED)` is invoked.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Platform or OS">
If your platform is not supported:

- Verify on [GoogleTest Supported Platforms Documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/platforms.md).
- Consider alternate testing frameworks if necessary.
- Check community forums for experimental patches.
