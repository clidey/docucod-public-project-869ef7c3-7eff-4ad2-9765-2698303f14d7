# Running and Validating Tests

This guide walks you through the essential steps of building your tests, executing the GoogleTest test runner, and interpreting the test output. By following this process, you will confirm that your GoogleTest installation is successful and understand typical usage patterns across different platforms.

---

## 1. Building Your Tests

Before you can run tests, your test programs need to be compiled and linked properly with GoogleTest.

### Prerequisites for Building
- **Include the GoogleTest header:** Add `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` in your test source files.
- **Link against GoogleTest libraries:** Your build system must link your tests with the GoogleTest binaries (`gtest`, and optionally `gtest_main` if you don't provide your own `main()`).

### Building Examples
If you use CMake, the common approach is:

```cmake
add_executable(my_tests my_tests.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest gtest_main pthread)
```

For Bazel, add a `cc_test` rule that depends on `@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main`.

### Compilation Outcome
After building successfully, you will have a test executable (e.g., `my_tests`) ready to run.

<Tip>
Always verify your build commands include the right include paths and linking flags for GoogleTest to avoid linkage or compile errors.
</Tip>

## 2. Executing the Test Runner

GoogleTest test programs are regular executables that discover and run all registered tests when executed.

### Running Tests
Simply run your test binary from the command line:

```bash
./my_tests
```

This executes all the tests registered in your program.

### Common Command-Line Flags
GoogleTest supports various command-line flags to customize test execution:

| Flag                     | Description                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter=*`       | Run all tests (default behavior)                     |
| `--gtest_filter=Suite.Test` | Run a specific test                                   |
| `--gtest_color=yes/no/auto` | Control colored output                                |
| `--gtest_repeat=N`       | Repeat tests N times (set -1 for infinite repetition)|
| `--gtest_list_tests`     | List all available tests without running them        |
| `--gtest_fail_fast`      | Stop running after the first failure                  |

For a full list of flags, run your test executable with `--help`.

### Filtering Example
To run only tests in `FactorialTest` suite:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*
```

<Tip>
Use filtering to focus on specific tests while debugging or developing.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding Test Output

When you run your tests, GoogleTest prints clear and structured output to the console.

### Basic Output Example
```none
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

### Interpreting the Output
- `[ RUN      ]` and `[       OK ]` show test start and success.
- `[  FAILED  ]` indicates test failure.
- Summary shows counts and which tests failed.

### Running Tests with Verbose or Brief Output
- Use `--gtest_brief=1` to show only failures.
- Use color flags for clearer pass/fail distinction.

<Tip>
Review the detailed failure messages and source locations to diagnose test failures quickly.
</Tip>

## 4. Validating Your Installation

Running and passing a simple test program is the quickest way to validate your GoogleTest installation.

### Quick Validation Test
Create a simple test file `sample_test.cc`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and run it:

```bash
g++ sample_test.cc -lgtest -lpthread -o sample_test
./sample_test
```

You should see all tests pass.

<Tip>
Use this simple test to ensure GoogleTest libraries are properly linked and executable.
</Tip>

## 5. Typical Usage Patterns Across Platforms

GoogleTest is portable and behaves consistently on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

### Platform Specific Notes
- **Linux/macOS:** Link with `-lgtest` and `-lpthread`. Use `g++` or `clang++`.
- **Windows:** Link against the appropriate `.lib` files; be mindful of `UNICODE` settings and wide character `argv` support.

### Using the `gtest_main` Library
If you link with `gtest_main`, you do not need to supply your own `main()`; GoogleTest provides it. This simplifies building your tests.

### Advanced Execution
GoogleTest supports running tests in parallel, repeated runs, and sharding across machines, primarily controlled via environment variables and flags.

<Tip>
Refer to your platform's build and linking conventions to integrate GoogleTest smoothly.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Running
- Ensure tests are linked into your executable.
- Verify your test names do not have underscores in test or suite names.

### Test Filtering Not Working
- Check the filter patterns for syntax and underscores.

### Failures Despite Correct Code
- Review assertion messages carefully.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to debug failures.

### Linking Errors
- Confirm GoogleTest libraries are linked.
- Include necessary thread libraries (`-lpthread`).

### Skipped Tests
- Confirm you are not unintentionally using `GTEST_SKIP`.
- Verify flags for including disabled tests.

## 7. Next Steps

After successfully running your first tests:

- Explore writing your own tests: [Writing Your First Test](create-first-test.md).
- Learn about assertions: [Assertions Reference](assertions.md).
- Configure and customize test runs using flags: [Advanced Testing Options](advanced.md#running-test-programs-advanced-options).
- Optionally, learn mocking with GoogleMock: [Getting Started with GoogleMock](first-mock-test.md).
