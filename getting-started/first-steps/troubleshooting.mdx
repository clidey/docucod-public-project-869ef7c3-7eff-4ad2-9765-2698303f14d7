# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide addresses frequent setup, build, and runtime problems encountered when using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It provides practical steps to diagnose, verify, and resolve compiler errors, linker issues, and misconfigurations that arise during initial setup or first use.

---

## 1. Compiler Errors

### Problem: Mock Methods Not Recognized or Undefined

**Symptoms:**
- Compilation fails when using `MOCK_METHOD` or `EXPECT_CALL` macros.
- Errors suggest methods are undefined or not virtual.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Method Not Declared Virtual:** GoogleMock relies on mocking virtual methods. Ensure the method you're mocking in the interface/base class is declared `virtual` (pure or otherwise).

  ```cpp
  class Interface {
   public:
    virtual ~Interface() {}
    virtual int Compute() = 0;  // Must be virtual
  };
  ```

- **MOCK_METHOD Syntax:** Check the syntax especially for arguments with commas or special types. Wrap argument types containing commas in parentheses or use type aliases.

  ```cpp
  // Error:
  MOCK_METHOD(std::pair<bool, int>, GetPair, ());  // Won't compile

  // Correct:
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  using PairBoolInt = std::pair<bool, int>;
  MOCK_METHOD(PairBoolInt, GetPair, ());
  ```

- **Include Correct Headers:** Make sure to include `<gmock/gmock.h>` before using mocking macros.

- **Virtual Destructor:** The base interface must have a virtual destructor to avoid undefined behavior or warnings.

### Problem: MSVC Warnings About Const Parameters

**Symptoms:**
- MSC compiler warnings C4301 or C4373 regarding overriding methods with const parameters.

**Solution:**
- Remove top-level `const` from parameters in the base and mock class, as they are ignored by C++ and cause MSVC to warn incorrectly.

---

## 2. Linker Errors

### Problem: Undefined Symbols for Mock Methods

**Symptoms:**
- Linker errors indicate missing symbols for mock methods.

**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Separate Compilation Issue:** GoogleMock generates method definitions behind the scenes but expects constructors and destructors to be defined if declared.

- **Ensure Constructor and Destructor Are Defined:**
  If you declare constructors or destructors for your mock class explicitly, provide their definitions in a `.cc` file to avoid repeated inline generation and linker errors.

  ```cpp
  // Header
  class MockFoo : public Foo {
   public:
    MockFoo();
    ~MockFoo() override;
    MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (), (override));
  };

  // Source
  MockFoo::MockFoo() = default;
  MockFoo::~MockFoo() = default;
  ```

- **Check Build System:** Confirm your build system compiles and links all required source files and GoogleMock dependencies.

---

## 3. Runtime Issues

### Problem: Uninteresting Call Warnings "Uninteresting mock function call"

**Explanation:**
- These warnings occur when a mock method without any `EXPECT_CALL` is invoked. By default, GoogleMock treats mocks as "naggy" and warns about such calls.

**How to Manage:**
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls.

  ```cpp
  using ::testing::NiceMock;
  NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
  // Uninteresting calls won't produce warnings now.
  ```

- Alternatively, add a catch-all expectation to explicitly allow calls:

  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, SomeMethod(_)).Times(::testing::AnyNumber());
  ```

- Use `StrictMock` to make uninteresting calls cause failures if you want strict behavior.

### Problem: Unexpected Call Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Test fails with messages about unexpected mock calls.

**Cause:**
- A call is made to a mock method with arguments that do not match any `EXPECT_CALL`.

**Solution:**
- Define explicit expectations for all expected calls.
- Use wildcards (`_`) or less restrictive matchers for parameters when precise argument matching isnâ€™t required.

### Problem: Default Action Not Set on Non-default-constructible Return Types

**Symptoms:**
- Runtime failures or exceptions with messages indicating no default action for a method without a trivial return type.

**Solution:**
- Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior explicitly.

  ```cpp
  ON_CALL(mock_foo, ComplexMethod(_)).WillByDefault(Return(SomeDefaultValue));
  ```

- Alternatively, set a custom default value via `::testing::DefaultValue<T>::Set()`.

### Problem: Tests Fail With "Called More Times Than Expected"

**Explanation:**
- The mock method was called more times than allowed by the `Times()` clause.

**How to Fix:**
- Review and adjust expectations for call counts.
- Use `.Times(::testing::AnyNumber())` or `AtLeast()` if multiple calls are expected.

### Problem: Nesting of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` Not Supported

**Note:** GoogleMock does not support nesting these strictness modifiers (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockFoo>>`). Avoid nesting to prevent unintended behavior.

---

## 4. Verifying Mock Object Expectations Early

Sometimes you want to verify if all expectations are met before mock object destruction, especially when ownership is unclear.

Use:

```cpp
::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

This checks the current status of expectations and clears them, helping catch unmet expectations promptly.

**Note:** Avoid setting new expectations after this call to prevent undefined behavior.

---

## 5. Tips for Smooth Setup and Usage

- **Include Paths:** Ensure the include path includes GoogleMock headers.
- **Link Libraries:** Link with GoogleTest, GoogleMock, and pthread (on Unix-like systems).
- **Compiler Requirements:** Use a C++17 (or newer) compliant compiler.
- **Avoid Mixing Versions:** Use consistent versions of GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- **Enable Verbose Logging for Debugging:**

  Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call traces to understand unexpected failures.

  ```shell
  ./my_tests --gmock_verbose=info
  ```

- **Suppress Warnings Appropriately:** Use `NiceMock` during prototyping or when warnings about uninteresting calls are distracting.

- **Review Mock Object Lifetimes:** Ensure mocks are destroyed appropriately to trigger verification.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Expectation order matters: Set all `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising mock.
- Don't expect to mock non-virtual methods without extra patterns.
- Constructor arguments of mocks must match those of base mocks when using strictness wrappers like `NiceMock`.
