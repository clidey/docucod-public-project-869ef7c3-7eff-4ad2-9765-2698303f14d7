# Verifying Your Setup

Confirming that GoogleTest is correctly installed, linked, and discoverable in your environment is a critical early step to ensure your tests will run smoothly. This guide walks you through simple, actionable steps to validate your GoogleTest installation and exemplifies basic usage with the assert macros that guarantee your testing environment is operational.

---

## 1. Prerequisites Before Verification

Before verifying your setup, make sure:

- GoogleTest is installed and built successfully using your preferred method (e.g., as a standalone project with CMake or incorporated into your build).
- Your build system is correctly configured to locate GoogleTest headers and link against the GoogleTest libraries.
- You have a compatible C++17 compiler as GoogleTest requires C++17 support.

If you havenâ€™t completed installation, please refer to the installation guides:

- [Installing GoogleTest with CMake](getting-started/installation/installation-cmake)
- [Installing GoogleTest with Bazel](getting-started/installation/installation-bazel)

Ensure your development environment matches the system and compiler requirements noted in the system prerequisites documentation.


## 2. Writing a Basic Test to Confirm Setup

The simplest way to check that the GoogleTest framework is working is to compile and run a minimal test case. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Test Source File

Create a file named `basic_test.cpp` with the following contents:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test case that always succeeds.
TEST(BasicTestSuite, BasicTestCase) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

### Step 2: Compile the Test

Compile the test source file, ensuring that the compiler can find GoogleTest's headers and link against the GoogleTest libraries. Example commands:

- **Using g++ and pkg-config** (Linux/macOS):

```bash
g++ basic_test.cpp -o basic_test `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest` -pthread
```

- **Using CMake**: Add this snippet to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(basic_test basic_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(basic_test ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)
```

### Step 3: Run the Test

Execute the binary:

```bash
./basic_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```shell
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from BasicTestSuite
[ RUN      ] BasicTestSuite.BasicTestCase
[       OK ] BasicTestSuite.BasicTestCase (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from BasicTestSuite (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This successful output confirms GoogleTest is installed, compiled, linked, and discoverable.

## 3. Quick Checks with Basic Assertions

GoogleTest provides a rich library of *assert* macros for validating conditions. For quick validation during setup, these are useful:

- `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` / `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`: checks if `condition` is true.
- `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` / `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)`: checks if `condition` is false.
- `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`: checks if two values are equal.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(BasicAssertions, TestEquivalence) {
  ASSERT_EQ(42, 42) << "Basic equality check failed.";
  EXPECT_TRUE(1 < 2);
  EXPECT_FALSE(2 < 1);
}
```

Add this test to your test suite and rerun to verify that assertions behave as expected.

## 4. Verifying GoogleMock Integration (Optional)

GoogleMock is bundled with GoogleTest. If you use mocks in your project, it's helpful to verify that gMock functions as well.

### Step 1: Write a Simple Mock Test

Example code snippet from the `gmock_for_dummies.md` for a minimal mock test:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
};

TEST(MockTest, BasicMockCall) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  turtle.PenDown();
}
```

### Step 2: Build and Run

Compile and run this code the same way as your other tests. Passing this test indicates GoogleMock is correctly installed and operational.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

**Problem:** Test executable fails to compile due to missing headers or libraries.

- **Check** that GoogleTest include directories and libraries are correctly referenced in your build.
- **On Linux/macOS**, verify the presence of `libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a` files in expected locations.
- **On Windows**, ensure that runtime library settings between your project and GoogleTest match (see Visual Studio notes).

**Problem:** Tests fail to run or no tests are discovered.

- Confirm that your test functions use the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros properly.
- Verify that the test program calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` after `InitGoogleTest()`.

**Problem:** Linking errors mentioning `gtest_main`.

- You may need to link with the `gtest_main` library or define your own `main` function as shown in the Primer guide.

- [Platform-specific Notes](getting-started/installation/platform-specific-notes)

## 6. Next Steps

Once you confirm the setup is correct, you can:

- Begin writing your own tests as shown in [Writing Your First Test](getting-started/first-steps/writing-your-first-test).
- Explore advanced test writing techniques, fixtures, and parameterized tests in the GoogleTest Primer and Guides.
- Learn how to use GoogleMock for sophisticated mock objects and interaction testing.

## Summary

This page enabled you to verify that GoogleTest is correctly installed, linked, and fully operational in your environment. By writing and running simple test cases and basic assertions, you confirm that the testing framework integrates smoothly. Optionally, you can also validate GoogleMock to prepare for mocking capabilities.

For a deeper dive into using GoogleTest after validation, consult the [GoogleTest Primer](docs/primer.md) and its related topics such as writing your first test and test fixtures. For troubleshooting and platform-specific tips, refer to the corresponding setup and troubleshooting documentation.
