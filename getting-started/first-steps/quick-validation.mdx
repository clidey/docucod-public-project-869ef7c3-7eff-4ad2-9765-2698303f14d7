# Quick Validation Checklist

A fast and practical checklist to ensure your GoogleTest installation and initial setup are successful, so you can confidently move forward with writing and running tests.

---

## 1. Confirming Installation and Setup

Ensure GoogleTest is properly installed and integrated in your development environment.

### ✅ Basic Verification Steps

- **Include GoogleTest headers** without errors:
  ```cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>
  ```

- **Initialize GoogleTest** in your test executable’s `main` function:
  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

- **Compile and link** your test program successfully against GoogleTest libraries.

### ✅ Running a Minimal Test

Create the simplest test to verify runtime setup:

```cpp
TEST(SanityCheck, Basic) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```

Run the compiled test program. You should see output indicating the test passed.

---

## 2. Understanding Expected Output of a Passing Test

When tests pass successfully, GoogleTest prints concise log lines:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck
[ RUN      ] SanityCheck.Basic
[       OK ] SanityCheck.Basic (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

### Key indicators of success include:

- `[ RUN ]` and `[ OK ]` lines for each test indicate execution and pass.
- Summary lines show the total tests run and count of passed tests.
- No `[ FAILED ]` lines present.

---

## 3. Common Signs of Misconfiguration or Installation Issues

If your setup is incorrect, you may encounter:

- Compilation errors referencing missing or inaccessible GoogleTest headers.
- Linker errors about undefined GoogleTest symbols.
- Runtime errors or crashes running tests.
- Test executable exits immediately or reports zero tests run.
- Unexpected output or inability to recognize GoogleTest flags.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- Verify that the include directories and libraries for GoogleTest are correctly specified in your build system.
- Ensure `InitGoogleTest()` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Confirm that your compiler supports C++17 or later (a GoogleTest requirement).
- For CMake or Bazel users, consult the installation documentation for recommended usage.

---

## 4. Key Command-Line Flags to Validate Your Setup

Run your test executable with these flags to confirm configuration:

- `--gtest_list_tests`

  - Lists all discovered tests without running them.
  - Verify your tests show up as expected.

- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`

  - Runs a specific test; useful to isolate and check.

- `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`

  - Runs tests marked disabled with `DISABLED_` prefix.

- `--gtest_fail_fast`

  - Stops execution on first failure; useful during iteration.

Run with `--help` to see all supported flags.

## 5. Checking Test Output and Failures

Familiarize yourself with the output to quickly spot problems.

### Output Sections

- **Test Start:** `[ RUN      ] TestSuite.TestName`
- **Test Success:** `[       OK ] TestSuite.TestName (XX ms)`
- **Test Failure:** `[  FAILED  ] TestSuite.TestName (XX ms)`
- **Summary:** Shows counts of passed, failed, skipped, and disabled tests.

### Reviewing Failure Reports

Failure messages include source file, line number, and collected assertions. Use this to debug test failures effectively.

## 6. Next Steps and Where to Get Help

After confirming your setup is sound:

- Move on to writing your first tests, using the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md).
- Explore detailed assertion guides for more complex validations.
- Learn about test fixtures and parameterized tests to organize tests effectively.
- Visit the [Integration & Extensibility](overview/features-and-integration/integration-overview) page to integrate GoogleTest with your build system.
- Consult [Common Installation & Setup Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/common-installation-issues) for troubleshooting.

<Tip>
If you encounter unexpected behavior, re-run your tests with `--gtest_brief=1` to suppress output except failures, making issues easier to identify.
</Tip>

<Note>
Always verify compiler compatibility and linkage settings first if tests fail to run or compile.
</Note>

<Warning>
Do not ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`: your test program should return it to signal success or failure to your build/CI system.
</Warning>
