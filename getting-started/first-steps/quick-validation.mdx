# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist helps you quickly verify that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup is correct and ready for running tests. By following these steps, you ensure your builds are correct, linking is successful, and sample tests run as expected with proper outputs. Completing this checklist gives you confidence to proceed with more advanced test writing and mocking.

---

## 1. Confirm Your Build

Make sure your project builds cleanly with GoogleTest and GoogleMock integrated.

### Steps:

- Run your build system (e.g., `cmake --build .`, `bazel build //...`) with your test targets.
- Confirm the build finishes without errors.
- Confirm GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are linked correctly.

### What to Expect:

- Compiled binaries or libraries linked against GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- No unresolved symbols or linker errors related to GoogleTest or GoogleMock.

<Tip>
If you encounter build errors, ensure you followed the installation and configuration instructions correctly, including setting up include paths and linking GoogleTest & GoogleMock.
</Tip>

## 2. Run a Sample Test

Execute a simple test that exercises GoogleTest or GoogleMock to verify runtime behavior.

### Steps:

- Create or use a basic test file, for example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SanityCheck, TrueIsTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

- Compile this with your project.
- Run the resulting test binary, e.g., `./my_test_binary`.

### What to Expect:

- Test framework initializes and runs the test.
- Output indicates the test passed with no failures.

Example output snippet:

```text
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck
[ RUN      ] SanityCheck.TrueIsTrue
[       OK ] SanityCheck.TrueIsTrue (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
Run your test binary with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed information during test execution, helpful for debugging if tests fail.
</Tip>

## 3. Verify Mock Linking and Behavior

Confirm GoogleMock is linked properly and mock expectations can be set and checked.

### Steps:

- Create a simple mock class and test, for example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Interface {
 public:
  virtual ~Interface() {}
  virtual int GetValue() = 0;
};

class MockInterface : public Interface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (override));
};

TEST(MockTest, ReturnsExpectedValue) {
  MockInterface mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(), 42);
}
```

- Compile and link this test.
- Run the test binary.

### What to Expect:

- Test passes, indicating the mock method was called as expected and returned the specified value.

Example output snippet:

```text
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[ RUN      ] MockTest.ReturnsExpectedValue
[       OK ] MockTest.ReturnsExpectedValue (0 ms)
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Check>
If the test fails or produces warnings about uninteresting calls, verify your mock is correctly declared and linked. Also, consider wrapping your mock in `NiceMock` to suppress warnings if those calls are expected.
</Check>

---

## 4. Observe Expected Output

Confirm your tests produce clear, informative output for success and failure scenarios.

### Expected Behavior:

- Test summary lines indicate number of tests run and pass/fail status.
- On failures, GoogleTest and GoogleMock print detailed messages including:
  - File and line number of the failing assertion
  - What was expected vs actual values
  - Stack traces if enabled
  - Detailed information when a mocked call is unexpected or times mismatch

**Example GoogleMock warning for uninteresting call:**

```text
GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Foo(42)
NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen.
```

**Example failure on unexpected call:**

```text
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Foo(99)
Google Mock tried the following 1 expectation, but it didn't match:

file.cc:50: EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(42))...
  Expected arg #0: is equal to 42
           Actual: 99
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: called once - saturated and active
```

## 5. Additional Verification Tips

- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` if you want to explicitly verify mock expectations before object destruction.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj)` to suppress leak warnings if your mock object must deliberately outlive test scope.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) to enforce call order if needed.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default mock behavior without asserting call count.
- Adjust `--gmock_verbose` level (`info`, `warning`, `error`) to get the right amount of logging.

<Tip>
To avoid brittle tests, verify only what your code contract requires. Use `ON_CALL` for common/default behavior and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for critical interaction points.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build failures or missing symbols">
- Confirm GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are built and installed correctly.
- Verify include paths and library link paths in your build system.
- Check for mismatched compiler flags or ABI incompatibilities.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected mock function call errors">
- Verify all expected calls are set before exercising code.
- Check argument matchers to ensure they match actual invocations.
- Remember that newer EXPECT_CALLs override older ones.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting call warnings">
- By default, GoogleMock prints warnings for calls to mock methods without EXPECT_CALL.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress these warnings if they are expected.
- Alternatively, add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress warnings selectively.
- Do not blindly suppress warnings by adding meaningless EXPECT_CALLs without intent.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test output too verbose or not detailed enough">
- Adjust verbosity with `--gmock_verbose` flag.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed call tracing.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=warning` for warnings and errors (default).
- Use `--gmock_verbose=error` for only errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
