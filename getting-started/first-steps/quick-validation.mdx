# Quick Validation Checklist

A simple, task-focused checklist to confirm your GoogleTest environment is correctly set up and operational. By completing these steps, you'll ensure your testing framework is ready to write and run tests effectively.

---

## 1. Verify GoogleTest Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Compile a simple test program. Create a file named `sample_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertion) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

3. Compile the test with your usual compiler and library linkage. For example:

```shell
# Using g++ and pkg-config
g++ sample_test.cc -o sample_test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest_main) -pthread
```

4. Run the compiled executable:

```shell
./sample_test
```

5. Confirm the output shows a passing test:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertion
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If compilation fails, make sure your include and library paths are set correctly.
- On some platforms, you may need to link explicitly to `gtest` and `pthread`.
- On Windows, ensure your project settings link against the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries appropriately.

---

## 2. Validate GoogleTest Command-line Flags

GoogleTest provides many command-line flags to customize test runs.

1. Run your test executable with the flag `--gtest_list_tests`:

```shell
./sample_test --gtest_list_tests
```

2. Confirm it outputs the test suite and test:

```
SampleTest.
  BasicAssertion
```

3. Run the test filtering flag to run the specific test:

```shell
./sample_test --gtest_filter=SampleTest.BasicAssertion
```

4. Confirm the test runs and passes.

---

## 3. Check for Disabled Tests

1. Add the `DISABLED_` prefix to your test name in `sample_test.cc`:

```cpp
TEST(SampleTest, DISABLED_BasicAssertion) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```

2. Compile and run without special flags.

3. Confirm the test does not run and the output shows:

```
[==========] Running 0 tests from 0 test suites.
...
[  PASSED  ] 0 tests.
```

4. Run again with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`:

```shell
./sample_test --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

5. Confirm the disabled test runs and passes.

---

## 4. Verify Mocking Support

GoogleTest ships with GoogleMock to support mocks.

1. Add a mock class declaration in your test file:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x), ());
};

TEST(MockTest, CanSetExpectation) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5)).WillOnce(::testing::Return(10));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Bar(5), 10);
}
```

2. Compile linking with GoogleMock libraries.
3. Run the test and confirm it passes.

### Troubleshooting

- If the compiler cannot find MOCK_METHOD, ensure you include `<gmock/gmock.h>`.
- Linking issues? Ensure GoogleMock static or shared libraries are correctly linked.

---

## 5. Final Confirmation

1. All tests should pass.
2. Running with `--gtest_brief=1` should suppress passing test output, showing only failures.

```shell
./sample_test --gtest_brief=1
```

3. Running with different `--gtest_color` flags (`yes`, `no`, `auto`) should respectively enable or disable colored output.

4. Verify the program returns `0` when tests pass and non-zero when any test fails.
