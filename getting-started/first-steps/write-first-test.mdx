# Writing and Running Your First Test

This guide will walk you through creating your first basic test using GoogleTest. You will learn how to write a simple test case, compile it, run it, and interpret the results to ensure your test environment functions correctly.

---

## 1. Create Your First Test File

Start by creating a C++ source file named `sample_test.cc` (or any preferred name). This file will contain one or more test cases using GoogleTest's macros.

### Minimal Example: A Basic Test

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test case named `SimpleTest` with one test `BasicAssertions`.
TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Expect equality.
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
  // Check a boolean condition.
  EXPECT_TRUE(42 == 7 * 6);
  // Expect inequality.
  EXPECT_NE(1, 0);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` defines a test shown as `TestSuiteName.TestName`.
- `EXPECT_*` macros are assertions you use to verify conditions.
- Tests are run independently; failures in one don't affect others.

<Tip>
Avoid underscores (`_`) in `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` to prevent internal naming conflicts with GoogleTest. Prefer names like `SimpleTest` over `Simple_Test`.
</Tip>

## 2. Compile Your Test

To compile your test, link it against the GoogleTest libraries. Here is an example using `g++` with CMake-managed libraries installed in standard locations:

```sh
# Compile sample_test.cc with C++17 standard and link with gtest and pthread.
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /usr/include/gtest -pthread sample_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -o sample_test
```

If you use CMake for your project, include GoogleTest in your `CMakeLists.txt` and link against `gtest_main`:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(sample_test PRIVATE GTest::gtest_main)
```

This setup automatically handles includes and linking.

<Tip>
Make sure you have built and installed GoogleTest on your system or included it as part of your project before building your tests.
</Tip>

## 3. Run Your Test Program

Once compiled, execute your test binary:

```sh
./sample_test
```

### Expected Output Example:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest
[ RUN      ] SimpleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SimpleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This indicates your test ran successfully.

<Tip>
If you see messages about no tests to run or linker errors, verify proper linking with GoogleTest libraries and that your test file syntax follows GoogleTest conventions.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Test Results

- `[ RUN      ] TestSuiteName.TestName` indicates the test start.
- `[       OK ] TestSuiteName.TestName` means the test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ] TestSuiteName.TestName` means the test failed.

Failures will present messages showing the line number and the reason, helping you debug.

## 5. Next Steps

- Add more test cases using `TEST` and `TEST_F` (fixture-based tests) to cover your code.
- Explore assertions beyond `EXPECT_EQ`, such as string assertions, exception assertions, and floating-point comparisons.
- Learn how to write and use test fixtures to share setup/teardown code.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Linker errors for GoogleTest symbols:** Ensure that `-lgtest` and `-lgtest_main` are linked correctly and GoogleTest is installed.
- **Test discovery issues:** Confirm your tests use the correct `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros, and that you run the binary that includes these tests.
- **Test failures:** Examine the failure message printed by GoogleTest to identify assertion issues.


By following these steps, you will create a compiled GoogleTest binary that runs your first tests reliably and displays informative results.

Happy testing!
