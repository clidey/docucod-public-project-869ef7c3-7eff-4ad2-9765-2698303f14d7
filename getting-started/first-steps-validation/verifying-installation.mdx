# Verifying Your Installation

This page guides you through confirming that your installation of GoogleTest is complete and functional. You'll compile and run a sample test to verify the setup, interpret the expected output, and troubleshoot common issues encountered during initial configuration.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before verifying your installation, ensure the following:

- **GoogleTest is installed** on your system according to your chosen method (CMake, Bazel, or manual integration).
- You have a working C++ compiler compatible with GoogleTest (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- Your build environment includes necessary dependencies such as pthread support if on Unix-like systems.


## 2. Compiling a Sample Test

To validate your installation quickly, compile and run a simple test case using GoogleTest.

### Step 1: Create a Sample Test File

Create a file named `sample_test.cpp` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test case.
TEST(SampleTest, SimpleAssertion) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This code defines a basic test that asserts `1 + 1` equals `2`.

### Step 2: Compile the Test

Depending on your installation, compile the test as follows:

#### Using pkg-config:

```bash
c++ sample_test.cpp -o sample_test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest_main)
```

#### Using CMake:

Include GoogleTest in your `CMakeLists.txt` and link with `gtest_main`.

Example compilation command might look like:

```bash
c++ sample_test.cpp -o sample_test -lgtest_main -lgtest -lpthread
```

### Step 3: Run the Test

Execute the binary:

```bash
./sample_test
```

## 3. Understanding the Expected Output

A successful run will output something similar to:

```none
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.SimpleAssertion
[       OK ] SampleTest.SimpleAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest ran. (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This indicates the test executed and passed successfully.

If the output includes failures or does not run any tests, this signifies an installation or configuration issue.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Encountering problems? Use the following tips:

### Issue 1: "undefined reference" or linker errors

- **Cause:** The linker cannot find GoogleTest libraries.
- **Solution:** Verify that you link against `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries and include pthread if required.

Example:

```bash
c++ sample_test.cpp -o sample_test -lgtest_main -lgtest -lpthread
```

### Issue 2: GoogleTest headers not found

- **Cause:** Compiler cannot find GoogleTest include directories.
- **Solution:** Ensure include directories for GoogleTest are correctly specified. Use `pkg-config` if available.

Example:

```bash
c++ sample_test.cpp -o sample_test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest_main)
```

or add `-I/path/to/googletest/include` manually.

### Issue 3: No tests run or zero tests found

- **Cause:** Improper linking or missing `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` invocation.
- **Solution:** Confirm `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()`. Also, validate that the test binary is linked against `gtest_main` or you have provided your own `main()` function.

### Issue 4: Tests hang or crash immediately

- **Cause:** Mismatched runtime libraries or threading issues.
- **Solution:** Check that your compiler and GoogleTest libraries are built with compatible settings (e.g., both static or dynamic runtime). On Windows, ensure consistent CRT linkage.

## 5. Next Steps

After confirming your installation works:

- Explore writing your own tests following the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md).
- Learn to organize tests and use fixtures efficiently.
- Start using GoogleMock for creating mock objects and expectations.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting-resources/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you face other problems.

## 6. Additional Tips

- Always check the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which signals pass/fail status of your test suite.
- Use `--help` flag on your test executable to discover runtime flags (e.g., filtering, output options).
- Run tests with verbose and color output enabled for better diagnostics.

# Example: Full Compile and Run Cycle

```bash
# Write sample_test.cpp (as above)

# Compile (example using pkg-config)
c++ sample_test.cpp -o sample_test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest_main)

# Run
./sample_test
```

Success is confirmed when you see the test pass as shown.

<Tip>
To ensure a smooth workflow, replicate this verification step each time you reinstall or update GoogleTest. It prevents confusion later by confirming foundational setup is correct.
