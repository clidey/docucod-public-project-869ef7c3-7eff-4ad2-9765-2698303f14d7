# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your GoogleTest installation and setup are fully functional by running through this concise checklist. This will confirm that GoogleTest is properly linked, detected by your build system, and able to execute basic tests â€” setting a strong foundation for your testing workflow.

---

## 1. Verify Linking and Include Paths

Make sure your project can locate and link against GoogleTest libraries correctly.

- **Check Include**:
  - Verify your build includes GoogleTest headers, typically by adding `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` in your test source files.

- **Check Linking:**
  - Ensure the compiler and linker flags link to the GoogleTest static or shared libraries (e.g., `-lgtest` or the appropriate library files).
  - If using CMake, use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` and link with `target_link_libraries(your_target GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)`.


<Note>
If the test executable fails to link, double-check your compiler and linker flags. Refer to [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation-instructions) for platform-specific guidance.
</Note>

## 2. Confirm Build System Recognizes GoogleTest

Validate that your build configuration correctly discovers GoogleTest.

- **CMake:**
  - Call `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)`.
  - Confirm that `GTest_FOUND` is true.
  - Use `target_link_libraries` as above.

- **Bazel:**
  - Use `@com_google_googletest//:gtest` as a dependency.

- **Manual Build:**
  - Confirm that include paths and library paths point to GoogleTest.


<Tip>
Use `pkg-config` if available (`pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest`) to obtain compiler and linker options.
</Tip>

## 3. Build and Link a Trivial Test Program

Create a simple test program to confirm that GoogleTest is functional.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SanityTest, SimpleAssert) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- Build this with your configured build system.
- Link with GoogleTest libraries.

## 4. Execute the Test Binary

Run your test executable from the command line:

```bash
./your_test_binary
```

You should see output similar to:

```none
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityTest
[ RUN      ] SanityTest.SimpleAssert
[       OK ] SanityTest.SimpleAssert
[----------] 1 test from SanityTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
If you have multiple cores, you can run tests in parallel using test runners or with certain build tools for faster validation.
</Tip>

## 5. Validate GoogleTest Features

- **Test Discovery:** Check that all `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` tests are found and listed with the `--gtest_list_tests` flag:

```
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

- **Failure Reporting:** Intentionally break a test (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ(1, 2);`) and observe readable failure messages.

- **Property Recording:** Test calling `RecordProperty()` in a test and confirm it appears in generated XML if enabled.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **`InitGoogleTest()` Call:** Confirm your `main()` function always calls `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Omitting this results in incorrect flag parsing.

- **Avoid Ignoring Test Results:** Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. For example,

```cpp
return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
```

- **Disabled Tests:** Tests and test suites with names starting with `DISABLED_` are not run. Use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` to temporarily run them.

- **Exception Support:** If you rely on exception assertions, ensure your build supports exceptions (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` macro). Otherwise, exception-based assertions won't function.

- **Fatal Assertions in Void-Returning Functions:** Only use fatal assertions (e.g., `ASSERT_*`) in functions returning `void`.

## 7. Troubleshooting

If tests don't run or linking fails:

- Verify your include and linker paths.
- Ensure C++17 or later is enabled in your compiler.
- Check for conflicts with other testing libraries.
- Use verbose build logs and `--gtest_list_tests` to diagnose test discovery issues.

## Summary

This checklist walks you through confirming that GoogleTest is correctly installed, recognized by your build system, and that it can execute a basic test with proper output. It highlights best practices around setup, running, and error handling for first-time users or integrators.
