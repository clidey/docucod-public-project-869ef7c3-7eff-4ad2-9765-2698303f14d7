# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist helps you confirm that your GoogleTest installation is complete, your tests are discoverable, and runnable. By following these steps, you ensure that your test executables properly link with GoogleTest, that linker settings are correct, and that you are able to see the expected test output with the first successful ("green") test run.

---

## 1. Verify GoogleTest Library Linking

- Confirm that your test project correctly links with the GoogleTest library artifacts.
- For CMake, ensure that you link against `gtest` or `gtest_main` and include the necessary directories.
- For Bazel, confirm dependencies on `@com_google_googletest//:gtest` are set.

<Tip>
If you see linker errors related to missing GoogleTest symbols, double-check your build scripts to include and link the GoogleTest libraries correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. Check Compiler and Language Settings

- GoogleTest requires **C++17** or later.
- Ensure your compiler supports C++17 and is set to use it (`-std=c++17` or equivalent).

<Warning>
Older compiler versions or incorrect compiler flags can cause GoogleTest initialization to fail silently or cause runtime errors.
</Warning>

## 3. Confirm Initialization

- Your test executables should call:

  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

- This call initializes the framework and parses GoogleTest-specific flags.

<Note>
You must call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Failing to do so causes flags to be unparsed and tests not to run as expected.
</Note>

## 4. Validate Test Discovery

- GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests defined using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and other macros.
- Run your test executable without any filter flags to ensure all defined tests are discovered.

### Check Flags for Filtering

- Ensure no unintended filter flags are set (e.g. `--gtest_filter`) that exclude tests.
- To verify test discovery, you can run:

  ```shell
  ./your_test_executable --gtest_list_tests
  ```

- This command lists all tests found by the binary.

## 5. Run Tests and Inspect Output

- Run your test executable normally:

  ```shell
  ./your_test_executable
  ```

- Confirm that the output includes lines:

  ```none
  [==========] Running X tests from Y test suites.
  [ RUN      ] YourTestSuite.YourTest
  [       OK ] YourTestSuite.YourTest
  [  PASSED  ] X tests.
  ```

- At least one test should pass (green `[       OK ]`).

<Check>
If you see no tests run or none passing, ensure that your test functions do not have the `DISABLED_` prefix.
</Check>

## 6. Confirm No Fatal Errors in Execution

- If your tests crash unexpectedly or fail to run:
  - Check for failing linker settings.
  - Review compiler errors or warnings.
  - Ensure that any required test environment setup is performed.

<Tip>
Enabling verbose output or running with `--gtest_print_time=1` can provide more diagnostic details.
</Tip>

## 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Make sure your tests are correctly named and do not begin with `DISABLED_` unless specifically intended.
- Do not forget to compile your tests with appropriate flags so GoogleTest macros are recognized.
- If you are using custom main(), call the Init and Run functions in the proper order.

## 8. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Tests Discovered">
- Confirm test definitions using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`.
- Check that files containing tests are part of your build.
- Run with `--gtest_list_tests` to see what tests are discovered.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linker Errors">
- Verify that the GoogleTest library is included in the link step.
- Use tools like `ldd` (Linux) or Dependency Walker (Windows) to verify linked libraries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests Not Running Due to Filters">
- Check environment variables like `GTEST_FILTER` or flags like `--gtest_filter`.
- Run with an empty or "*" filter: `--gtest_filter=*` to run all tests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Output or Silent Failure">
- Ensure `InitGoogleTest()` was called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Check for crashes before tests start.
- Verify your code does not call exit or terminate tests prematurely.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

By completing this checklist, you confirm that your GoogleTest environment is correctly configured, your tests are discoverable and runnable, and you get the expected output for your first test execution.
