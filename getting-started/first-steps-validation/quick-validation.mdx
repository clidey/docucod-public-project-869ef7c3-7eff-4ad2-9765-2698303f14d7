# Validation Checklist & Success Indicators

After completing your GoogleTest setup, it is crucial to quickly verify that everything is functioning correctly. This page guides you through key steps to confirm successful builds, correct test execution output, and proper linking of libraries, ensuring your environment is ready for writing and running tests.

---

## 1. Verify Your Build

A successful setup starts with building your test project without errors.

### Steps:

1. **Build your project** using your chosen build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel).
2. **Confirm no compilation or linking errors occur.**
3. If errors appear:
   - Check that GoogleTest libraries are correctly linked.
   - Confirm include paths point to valid GoogleTest header locations.
   - Verify C++ compiler and standard version (minimum C++17) compatibility.

<Tip>
If you encounter unresolved symbols during linking, ensure that the GoogleTest static or shared libraries are correctly specified in your linker settings. Missing `-lgtest` or `-lpthread` flags are common causes.
</Tip>

## 2. Run GoogleTest and Check Output

After a successful build, run your test binary to confirm GoogleTest executes properly.

### Steps:

1. Run your test executable from the command line.

   ```bash
   ./your_test_binary
   ```

2. Look for log output similar to the following:

   ```none
   [==========] Running X tests from Y test suites.
   [----------] Global test environment set-up.
   [ RUN      ] YourTestSuite.YourTest
   [       OK ] YourTestSuite.YourTest (NN ms)
   [----------] Global test environment tear-down
   [==========] X tests from Y test suites ran. (NN ms total)
   [  PASSED  ] X tests.
   ```

3. Confirm there are no failure or error messages.

<Tip>
Use the flag `--gtest_list_tests` to list all discovered tests to ensure your tests are properly registered by GoogleTest.

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```
</Tip>

## 3. Confirm Library Linking

GoogleTest uses both GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries (if using mocks).

### Steps:

1. Verify your build configuration links the following libraries:
   - `gtest` (for GoogleTest core)
   - `gtest_main` (optional, for pre-defined `main()`)
   - `gmock` (if mocking)
   - `pthread` (Linux/macOS POSIX threads, required for threading support)

2. If linking fails, verify:
   - Library search paths (`-L` flags) correctly point to installed GoogleTest library locations.
   - Correct linkage order: usually, `-lgmock -lgtest -lpthread`.

<Warning>
On Windows platforms, ensure you link against the appropriate GoogleTest and GoogleMock DLLs or static libraries matching your build configuration.
</Warning>

## 4. Check Test Execution Success Indicators

After running your test executable, assess the output to confirm all tests pass.

### What to look for:

- Final summary lines indicating **zero failed tests**.
- No error or warning messages.
- Each test suite and test name displayed with a `[       OK ]` or equivalent success tag.

### Sample passing output snippet:

```none
[          ] 3 tests from QueueTest
[ RUN      ] QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially
[       OK ] QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] QueueTest.DequeueWorks
[       OK ] QueueTest.DequeueWorks (1 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from QueueTest (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

<Tip>
If you see `[  FAILED  ]` entries, review the test failure messages above in the output for details.
</Tip>

## 5. Use GoogleTest API to Validate Setup Programmatically (Optional)

You can programmatically inspect the test results in your test code using the GoogleTest API.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();

  ::testing::UnitTest* unit_test = ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance();

  if (unit_test->Failed()) {
    std::cerr << "Some tests failed. Please check your test implementations." << std::endl;
    return result;
  }

  std::cout << "All tests passed successfully." << std::endl;
  return result;
}
```

This ensures that the test run completes without failures and your environment is validated.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Errors or Missing Symbols">
Check compiler flags to make sure `-I` include paths point to GoogleTest headers and linker `-L` paths point to libraries. Confirm C++17 support in your compiler.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Being Discovered or Run">
Use `--gtest_list_tests` to check if tests register correctly. Confirm test macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` are used properly and not disabled (no `DISABLED_` prefixes).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linking Issues on Windows">
Verify linking against correct `.lib` or `.dll` files. Ensure matching debug or release configurations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Parallel or Sharded Test Runs Not Covering All Tests">
Check environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` are set correctly for your shard.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Validation Tips

- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- If using `gtest_main` library, let it provide your `main()` to avoid execution errors.
- For CI pipelines, ensure the test binary exits with code 0 indicating success.
- Consider running tests with `--gtest_fail_fast` to halt on first failure if diagnosing build issues.
