# Validating the Test Environment

Quick steps to confirm GoogleTest and GoogleMock are installed and working—such as running built-in sample tests or using included utilities. Provides confidence that the installation is successful, setting the stage for deeper exploration.

---

## 1. Overview

After installing GoogleTest and GoogleMock, verifying their correct setup is vital before building your own tests. This page guides you through practical, hands-on steps to validate your environment by running sample tests included with the framework.

By doing so, you confirm that your build and runtime environments are properly configured and that both GoogleTest and GoogleMock components function as expected.

---

## 2. Prerequisites Check

Before running any tests, ensure:

- You have successfully installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock according to the installation guide.
- The standard libraries and build tools (e.g., C++17 compiler, CMake, Bazel) are set up properly.
- Your project includes `gtest` and `gmock` libraries and headers.
- Your environment supports running executables and has permissions to execute test binaries.

<Tip>
If you haven't yet installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock, please follow the [Installing GoogleTest & GoogleMock](../getting-started/setup-installation/installation-multiplatform.md) first.
</Tip>

## 3. Running Built-in Sample Tests

GoogleTest and GoogleMock repository provide built-in test suites that exercise the framework’s core and mock functionality.

These sample tests serve as practical smoke tests to verify your setup.

### Step-by-step Instructions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Sample Test Source">
The main GoogleMock tests are typically found in the `googlemock/test/` directory. An example is `gmock_test.cc` which contains numerous test cases covering basic and advanced mocking features.
</Step>
<Step title="Build the Sample Tests">
Use your configured build system (e.g., CMake or Bazel) to compile `gmock_test.cc` along with the GoogleMock and GoogleTest sources into an executable.

Example with CMake:
```shell
cmake --build build_dir --target gmock_main
```

This should produce an executable named `gmock_test` or similar.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Test Executable">
Execute the test binary:

```shell
./gmock_test
```

Expected outcome:

- The tests run and finish without failures.
- The output shows individual test cases passing with summaries.

This confirms both GoogleTest and GoogleMock are linked and operating correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you encounter build failures or missing symbols, confirm that your build process correctly links against both GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
</Tip>

## 4. Verifying GoogleMock Mocking Facilities

GoogleMock offers extensive mocking capabilities, including macros like `MOCK_METHOD`, and expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`.

The test suite includes tests like `gmock_spec_builders_test.cc` and `gmock_output_test_.cc` that specifically verify expectation-setting and mock method invocation logic.

### How to Verify:

1. Build these test binaries as part of your GoogleMock build products.
2. Run them to ensure that mocking constructs compile, are callable, and active expectations behave as expected.

Successful runs without error demonstrate that mocking macros and expectation APIs are functioning properly.

---

## 5. Using Included Test Utilities for Quick Validation

GoogleMock provides utilities to initialize and run tests programmatically. The following minimal example demonstrates using `InitGoogleMock()` and running all tests:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Steps:

- Place the above `main()` in a source file.
- Compile it linking with GoogleMock and GoogleTest libraries, plus any needed test files.
- Run the executable, and observe the output:
  - All defined sample and mock tests should be executed.
  - No failures or unexpected errors should appear.

This minimal test confirms your environment can initialize GoogleMock and run its tests.

---

## 6. Interpreting Test Results

- **All tests pass**: Your test environment is correctly set up.
- **Some tests fail**: Check specific error messages. Common issues include
  - Incorrect build linkage
  - Missing compiler flags for C++17 or stdlib incompatibility
  - Misconfigured include paths
- **Tests not discovered or not run**: Make sure `InitGoogleMock` is called and test files are linked correctly.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Failures or Linker Errors">
**Symptoms:** Compilation errors referencing missing GoogleMock or GoogleTest symbols.

**Resolution:**
- Verify that the build includes both `gtest` and `gmock` sources or libraries.
- Check that your `CMakeLists.txt` or equivalent links against `gmock_main` or both `gmock` and `gtest`.
- Confirm that compiler standards are set to at least C++17.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Being Discovered">
**Symptoms:** Your test executable runs but reports no tests executed.

**Resolution:**
- Ensure the main function calls `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Confirm that your test source files define test cases with `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros.
- Check for any missing `main()` function or multiple conflicting `main()` definitions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Errors or Unexpected Failures">
**Symptoms:** Some framework test cases fail inconsistently.

**Resolution:**
- Confirm that the GoogleMock and GoogleTest versions are compatible.
- Disable or adjust flags such as `--gmock_verbose` to control diagnostic outputs.
- Check thread safety if your tests use concurrency; ensure test code runs in main thread.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

- After validating the environment, begin writing your own tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Consult the detailed guides for creating mock classes, setting expectations, and verifying behavior.
- Explore mocking tutorials like [gMock for Dummies](../docs/gmock_for_dummies.md) and the [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md).
- If issues arise, visit [Troubleshooting Installation & Setup](../getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting-setup.md).

<Tip>
Remember, successful validation is your gateway to leveraging GoogleMock’s rich mocking capabilities in your testing workflows!

## Appendix: Minimal Sample Main for Validation

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and run this along with existing tests to confirm the environment.

## Appendix: Example Output Snippet From Successful Test Run

```shell
[==========] Running 123 tests from 10 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 10 tests from SomeMockTestSuite
[ RUN      ] SomeMockTestSuite.TestCase1
[       OK ] SomeMockTestSuite.TestCase1 (0 ms)
...
[----------] 10 tests from SomeMockTestSuite (2 ms total)
[==========] 123 tests from 10 test suites ran. (10 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 123 tests.
```

This confirms that tests ran with no failures.
