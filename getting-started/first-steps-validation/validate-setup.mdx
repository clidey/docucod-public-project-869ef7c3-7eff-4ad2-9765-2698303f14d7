# Quick Setup Validation

Verify your GoogleTest installation is functional and correctly configured before embarking on writing tests. This guide helps you validate your setup, explore basic test binary command line interface (CLI) options, and confirm dependencies and environment are ready.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation Readiness

Before writing tests, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **GoogleTest Is Installed**: Confirm `gtest` libraries and headers are accessible.
- **Compiler and Build Environment**: Ensure your compiler complies with C++17 or higher.
- **Test Binaries Are Buildable**: Compile a minimal test executable to validate integration.

<Tip>
Refer to [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.md) to confirm system compatibility.
</Tip>

## 2. Writing a Minimal Validation Test

Create a minimal test file to check basic GoogleTest functionality:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Verification test: always passes.
TEST(SetupTest, BasicCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Build Instructions

If using **CMake**, your `CMakeLists.txt` should link against GoogleTest:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
add_executable(validate_setup validate_setup.cc)
target_link_libraries(validate_setup GTest::gtest_main)
```

For manual compilation, ensure you include headers and link the GoogleTest static or shared libraries. For example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 validate_setup.cc -lgtest -lpthread -o validate_setup
```

## 3. Running the Validation Test

Execute your test binary:

```bash
./validate_setup
```

Expected output on success:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SetupTest
[ RUN      ] SetupTest.BasicCheck
[       OK ] SetupTest.BasicCheck
[----------] 1 test from SetupTest (0 ms total)

[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
If the test fails to run or cannot be compiled, verify your build system integration and that all dependencies are installed correctly.
</Tip>

## 4. Exploring Test Binary CLI Options

GoogleTest test binaries support standard CLI flags you can use for validation and debugging.

Execute your test binary with `--help` to see available options:

```bash
./validate_setup --help
```

Key flags include:

| Flag                            | Description                                           |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_list_tests`             | Lists all detected tests without running them         |
| `--gtest_filter=<pattern>`       | Runs a subset of tests matching the name pattern       |
| `--gtest_repeat=<count>`         | Repeats tests multiple times for stability checks      |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`       | Breaks into debugger on assertion failure             |
| `--gtest_color={yes|no|auto}`   | Controls colored output in terminals                   |

Example: List tests in the binary

```bash
./validate_setup --gtest_list_tests
```

Example: Run only the `SetupTest.BasicCheck`

```bash
./validate_setup --gtest_filter=SetupTest.BasicCheck
```

## 5. Verifying Environment Dependencies

Confirm that any required runtime dependencies are accessible when running tests:

- **Shared Libraries**: Ensure linker finds `libgtest.so` or `libgtest.a` if dynamically linked.
- **Thread Support**: GoogleTest expects POSIX threads or equivalent; confirm availability.
- **Correct Working Directory**: Running tests from unexpected directories might cause issues when tests load data files.

<Tip>
Check your runtime environment and linker paths (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, etc.) to ensure smooth execution.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

| Symptom                                   | Cause                                        | Resolution                           |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Missing GoogleTest headers at compile      | GoogleTest not installed or include path missing | Install GoogleTest or configure include paths |
| Linker errors related to GTest symbols     | GoogleTest library not linked                | Link against `-lgtest` and/or `-lgtest_main`  |
| Running tests but none are found            | Tests not registered or filtered out         | Remove filters or ensure tests defined properly |
| Test binary fails with undefined reference | Using deprecated or incompatible versions    | Update to compatible GoogleTest version        |

## 7. Next Steps After Validation

Once setup is confirmed:

1. Begin writing your first functional tests as shown in the [Writing and Running Your First Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-steps-validation/hello-world-test.md).
2. Explore compiling with CMake or Bazel in [Integrating with Your Build System](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/integration-build-systems.md).
3. Review common assertions to start verifying code behavior.

- Example of `main()` integration in tests

## Helpful Tips

- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before running tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Use test filters to quickly verify subsets of tests.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm test detection.
- Avoid mixing test fixtures improperly to prevent runtime failures.
