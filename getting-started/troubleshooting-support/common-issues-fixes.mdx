# Common Setup Issues and Solutions

This page presents a curated list of frequent installation and configuration issues encountered when setting up GoogleMock (gMock) alongside ways to resolve them effectively. If you've run into compiler errors, dependency conflicts, or unexpected build failures during your GoogleMock setup, this guide provides precise, actionable troubleshooting steps to get you back on track.

## 1. Compiler Errors Related to Mock Methods

### Issue: Warnings or errors when defining mock methods with `const` parameters using MSVC

**Problem:**
Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) versions like 2005 SP1 and 2008 SP1 emit warnings like C4301 or C4373 when a mock method is declared with `const` parameters, even though the code compiles fine on GCC or Clang.

**Why:**
In C++, `const` qualifiers on method parameters (especially primitive types like `int`) are ignored in declarations. MSVC incorrectly treats the overriding functions as mismatched by qualifier.

**Resolution:**
- Avoid declaring mock methods with `const` on parameters that are passed by value. Remove the `const` qualifier from both the base and mock class method declarations.

**Example:**
```cpp
// Incorrect (may cause MSVC warnings)
class Foo {
  virtual void Bar(const int i) = 0;
};
class MockFoo : public Foo {
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (const int i), (override));
};

// Correct
class Foo {
  virtual void Bar(int i) = 0;
};
class MockFoo : public Foo {
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (int i), (override));
};
```

### Issue: MSVC runs out of memory compiling large mock classes

**Problem:**
When compiling very large mock classes with the `/clr` compiler flag, you may experience massive memory usage.

**Resolution:**
- Avoid compiling native C++ mocks with `/clr` when possible.
- Split large mock classes into smaller components if feasible.

## 2. Linking and Build Failures

### Missing gMock symbols or headers

**Cause:**
Incorrect include paths or missing linkage settings.

**Resolution:**
- Ensure `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` is present in your test source files.
- Verify your build system links to the `gmock` and `gtest` libraries properly.
- Confirm paths to gMock headers and source files are included in your build configuration.

### Build fails on unsupported compiler or missing C++17 support

**Cause:**
GoogleMock requires a modern C++17-compliant compiler.

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade your compiler to one that supports C++17.
- Configure your build system with the proper standard flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang, `/std:c++17` for MSVC).

## 3. Dependency Conflicts

### Problem: Duplicate symbols or clashes with other libraries

**Resolution:**
- Avoid mixing different versions of GoogleTest or gMock in one build.
- Use a consistent version managed in your dependencies.
- If you build GoogleTest/gMock from source, avoid building multiple times with different settings.

## 4. Common Runtime Issues During Initialization

### Failure to initialize GoogleMock in main()

**Symptoms:**
Runtime errors or unexpected behavior due to gMock not being correctly initialized.

**Resolution:**
- Before running tests, invoke `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` in your `main()` function.
- For Unicode Windows apps, use the `wchar_t** argv` overload.

**Example:**
```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- If your platform or environment lacks `argc/argv`, use `testing::InitGoogleMock();` overload.

## 5. Common Expectation and Mocking Pitfalls

### Problem: `EXPECT_CALL` doesn't seem to intercept calls as expected

**Why:**
- Mocked methods must be **virtual**.
- Binding on non-virtual or static methods will not work for mocking.

**Solution:**
- Confirm your base class methods are declared `virtual`.
- If you have non-virtual methods, consider using high-performance dependency injection via templates (see gMock Cookbook for mocking non-virtual methods).

### Problem: Unexpected warnings about 'Uninteresting mock function call'

**Explaination:**
- These warnings indicate a call is made to a mock method for which no `EXPECT_CALL` exists.

**How to address:**
- Add an `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` if you want to allow all calls.
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify a default action without setting an expectation.
- Use `NiceMock` wrapper to suppress warnings for uninteresting mock calls by default.

## 6. Debugging Tips

### Enable verbose logging to diagnose issues

Run tests with:
```
--gmock_verbose=info
```
This prints detailed traces of mock function calls and matched expectations.

### Checking for leaked mocks

If you get errors about leaked mock objects at program exit:
- Ensure your mocks are deleted properly.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj);` if you intentionally want to keep a mock alive.

### Use `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=...` to control the amount of stack trace in output

This helps reduce clutter or get more context.

| Issue                        | Command or Action                          | Notes                               |
| ----------------------------| -----------------------------------------| -----------------------------------|
| Initialization              | `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` | Must be called before tests run    |
| Allow uninteresting calls   | `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` or use `NiceMock` |
| Check verbose calls         | Run test with `--gmock_verbose=info`    |
| Suppress leak errors        | `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj);`             |
| Fix MSVC const warnings     | Remove top-level `const` in method args |
