# Where to Go Next

This page guides you through the recommended next steps after setting up and running your first tests with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. You will find curated suggestions on how to deepen your understanding of the framework’s powerful mocking features, enhance your test suites, and explore practical examples to master advanced usage.

## Explore Advanced GoogleMock Features

GoogleMock offers a rich set of capabilities beyond basic mocking. To write more maintainable, precise, and robust tests, consider exploring these areas:

- **Mock Classes and Methods:** Learn the detailed syntax and usage of the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to create versatile mocks, including for overloaded methods and class templates.

- **Setting Expectations:** Master how to use `EXPECT_CALL` with fine-grained control clauses like `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, `.InSequence()`, and `.After()` to precisely specify mock interactions and call order.

- **Default Actions:** Understand how to use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors of your mocks when no expectations match.

- **Matchers:** Deepen knowledge of built-in and custom matchers used to specify argument constraints.

- **Actions:** Discover the wide variety of built-in actions and learn how to write your own for handling return values, side effects, and complex function behaviors.

- **Strictness Models:** Understand the difference between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control whether uninteresting calls generate warnings or failures.

For detailed recipes, examples, and best practices, refer to the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) and [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html).

## Use Sample Code and Cheat Sheets

Practical examples accelerate learning and adoption:

- Review the [gMock Cheat Sheet](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cheat_sheet.html) for quick syntax reminders and common idioms.

- Examine example test suites and mock implementations in the [googlemock GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) for real-world inspirations.

- Follow tutorials that illustrate how to mock various class types, use matchers, verify call orders, and write custom actions.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Refine your Mock Classes:** Use the detailed syntax in the Mocking Reference to deal with complex interfaces, overloaded methods, and move-only types.

2. **Master Expectations and Actions:** Experiment with sequencing calls, cardinalities, default actions, and specifying return values or side effects to write expressive tests.

3. **Write Custom Matchers and Actions:** If built-in matchers or actions don’t fit your needs, create custom ones to capture domain-specific logic.

4. **Use Strictness Models Judiciously:** Choose between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` according to the context of your tests to balance warning noise and test strictness.

5. **Explore Advanced Test Patterns:** Look into partial ordering using `.After()`, checkpointing with `MockFunction`, and combining mocks with fakes or delegating to real objects.
