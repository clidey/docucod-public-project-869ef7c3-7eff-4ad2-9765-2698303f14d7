## 3. Advance Your Expertise

Once comfortable with basics, deepen your mastery by exploring these advanced topics:

- **Custom Matchers and Actions** – Learn how to create tailor-made matchers and actions that express your unique testing needs. This enables you to write readable and expressive tests.

- **Mock Object Strictness and Behavior** – Understand the nuances of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control warnings and failures for uninteresting calls.

- **Ordering and Partial Ordering** – Use sequences and `After` clauses to precisely specify the order of expected calls in complex scenarios.

- **Testing Move-Only Types** – Techniques to mock methods that deal with `std::unique_ptr` and other move-only types effectively.

For detailed guidance, refer to the advanced guides linked from the main documentation hub.

## 4. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

To ensure your tests remain robust, maintainable, and effective:

- Use `ON_CALL` to set behavior without imposing expectations, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for actual expected calls.
- Prefer `NiceMock` to reduce noisy warnings during development.
- Verify and clear expectations explicitly if your mocks’ lifetimes extend beyond the test scope.
- Avoid overly strict expectations that can break easily on internal refactors.

Review the FAQ and troubleshooting sections for solutions to frequent issues.
