# Common Setup Issues

When getting started with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, you may encounter integration and setup issues that prevent your tests from building or running correctly. This guide helps you identify and resolve the most frequently faced problems related to system compatibility, build systems (CMake and Bazel), linking errors, compiler mismatches, and environment quirks.

## 1. Integration Failures with CMake or Bazel

### Problem: Tests fail to build due to missing dependencies or incorrect library linking.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you have installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock properly using the recommended procedure for your build system:
  - For **CMake**, confirm you have included GoogleTest with `add_subdirectory()` or found it with `find_package` and linked `gtest` and `gmock` in your target.
  - For **Bazel**, make sure your BUILD files correctly reference the `@com_google_googletest//:gtest` and `@com_google_googletest//:gmock` targets.
- Verify your `CMakeLists.txt` or BUILD files link both `gtest_main` and `gmock_main` libraries if your tests use mocks.
- Double-check that you are targeting C++17 or higher and that your compiler version meets GoogleTest’s requirements.

### Common Pitfalls:
- Forgetting that GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest and requires both to be linked.
- Mixing static and dynamic linking improperly can cause unresolved external symbols.
- Incorrect or missing initialization of GoogleMock in tests (use `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);`).

## 2. Linking Errors

You may encounter linker errors such as `undefined reference to testing::InitGoogleMock` or missing symbols for mock methods.

**How to Fix:**
- Confirm that your build links against both `libgtest` and `libgmock`.
- On Windows, check that you link against the correct runtime libraries and calling conventions.
- Make sure your mock classes correctly include `gmock/gmock.h` and use the `MOCK_METHOD` macros within `public:` sections.

## 3. Compiler Compatibility Mismatches

GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports C++17 or later. Build failures with strange errors or warnings can stem from incompatible compiler versions or missing C++17 features.

**Action Steps:**
- Verify your compiler version matches or exceeds the minimum: GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017 Update 3+.
- Check that C++17 (`-std=c++17` or `/std:c++17`) is explicitly enabled.
- If cross-compiling, verify your cross-compiler toolchain supports C++17 and associated libraries.

## 4. Environment Gotchas

Some environment-specific problems can block your test runs:

- **Unintended symbol macro collisions:**
  If your project includes system headers (like Win32 APIs) that define macros overlapping with function names, you might experience compilation errors. For example, `TextOut` might be macro-defined. To work around this:
  - Use `#undef` to undefine problematic macros before mocking related methods.
  - Alternatively, rename the mock method temporarily or shield system includes.

- **Uninteresting mock calls:**
  If you see warnings about uninteresting mock calls in your test output but your test did not explicitly set expectations, consider switching to `NiceMock` to suppress harmless warnings, or add default actions with `ON_CALL`.

## 5. Common Environment Errors and Diagnostics

### Uninteresting or Unexpected Calls

- GoogleMock reports "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings when you call a mock method without setting any expectation. These are not fatal but may indicate you forgot to set expectations.
- Increase verbosity via `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls and understand why expectations are not matched.

### Mock Object Leak Detection

- Leaked mock objects trigger errors in debug output indicating that some mock objects were not deleted and hence their expectations may not have been verified.
- Fix leaks by managing ownership properly or explicitly calling `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_obj)` when intentional.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed diagnostic traces.
- Ensure the mock methods you want to override are declared `virtual` in the base class.
- Avoid mocking variadic functions directly; provide overloads if you need to mock such behavior.
- Use proper qualifiers `(const, override)` in `MOCK_METHOD` declarations to avoid subtle compiler warnings or bugs.
- Check for macro expansion issues by carefully inspecting method names and includes.

## 8. Summary

By following best practices for integration and ensuring environment compatibility, you will avoid the most common setup issues. If errors persist, consult the verbose logging outputs and the extensive GoogleMock FAQ and Cookbook. Properly linking both GoogleTest and GoogleMock, adhering to compiler and C++ standard requirements, and managing mocks thoughtfully will smooth your development and testing experience.

<Tip>
For runtime issues related to "unexpected" or "excessive" mock calls, use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to trace all mock activity, helping isolate the exact mismatch or missing expectation.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Linker errors often stem from missing `-lgmock` or `-lgtest` libraries. Double-check your build system linkage and include paths.
</Warning>

<Note>
Uninteresting call warnings indicate calls without expectations. Use `NiceMock<>` to suppress these harmless warnings without compromising test failures on genuinely unexpected calls.
