# Validating Your Setup

Ensure your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation is functioning correctly by following these practical validation steps. This guide helps you recognize successful test runs, understand common test outputs, and troubleshoot typical issues you might encounter.

---

## 1. Running the Sample Test Suite

After installing and building GoogleTest (and optionally GoogleMock), a reliable way to verify your setup is to run the provided sample tests. These include comprehensive unit tests validating the framework itself.

### How to Run

- From your build directory, execute the test binary, typically named `gmock_sample_test` or `gtest_sample_test`.

```bash
./gmock_sample_test
```

- Alternatively, if you built with CMake, the test executable might be located under `build/googlemock/` or a similar directory.

### Expected Output

A successful run will produce output analogous to:

```plaintext
[==========] Running 64 tests from 9 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] SomeTestCase.SomeTest
[       OK ] SomeTestCase.SomeTest (0 ms)
... (more tests) ...
[----------] 64 tests from 9 test suites ran. (15 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 64 tests.
```

Look for "[  PASSED  ]" indicating no failures. The output contains a summary stating the number of tests run and their results.

<Tip>
Reading the test output carefully helps confirm that your build and link succeeded fully, and GoogleTest’s runtime components are working as expected.
</Tip>

## 2. Interpreting Test Output

Understanding the messages you see when running tests ensures you correctly interpret the status and response of your test environment.

### Success Indications

- **[  PASSED  ]** Normal test completion with all expectations met.
- **[ RUN      ]** Shows the beginning of each test’s execution.
- The absence of **[  FAILED  ]** lines confirms no test failures.

### Common Failure Signatures

- Tests marked with **[  FAILED  ]** indicate mismatches between expectations and actual behavior.
- Errors such as "Actual function call count doesn't match this expectation" show call count or argument mismatches in mocks.

### GoogleMock Specific Warnings

- Warnings like "Uninteresting mock function call" signal that a mock method was called without an `EXPECT_CALL` set—it is informational and does not fail the test.
- If you use "Naggy" or "Strict" mocks, the warnings and errors may differ in verbosity or fail tests on uninteresting calls.

### Test Output Verbosity

The verbosity of mock output can be controlled via the flag:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error
```

- `info`: Shows detailed tracing of mock calls including matched expectations and stack traces.
- `warning`: Shows warnings and errors only (default level).
- `error`: Shows errors only, suppressing warnings and info.

<Tip>
For initial validation, use the default or `warning` level to keep output manageable.
</Tip>

## 3. Basic Troubleshooting

If tests fail to run or produce errors, refer to these common scenarios and solutions.

### Common Issues

| Symptom                             | Cause                         | Resolution                                  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Test binary does not run            | Build failures or missing dependencies | Verify build steps and ensure dependencies are installed (e.g., CMake, compiler). |
| Linking errors                     | Missing `gtest` or `gmock` libraries | Confirm you link against `gtest` and/or `gmock` libraries correctly. |
| Tests fail with unexpected calls or mismatches | Incorrect or missing `EXPECT_CALL` setups in tests | Check mock expectations are properly set before function calls. |
| Runtime warnings about uninteresting calls | Mock objects without explicit expectations getting called | Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings or add appropriate `EXPECT_CALL`s. |

### Interpreting Failures

- **Check the error message:** The output will indicate which expectation was not met.
- **Review your test code:** Ensure that all `EXPECT_CALL`s or `ON_CALL`s are set before the code under test invokes mocked methods.
- **Enable verbose logging:** Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call information.

<Warning>
Running tests without any `EXPECT_CALL`s on mocks will lead to uninteresting call warnings or errors depending on mock strictness.
</Warning>

## 4. Example: Sample Test Execution

Here's a practical example to run tests and recognize successful output.

```bash
# Build your project (example with CMake)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run the sample test binary
./gmock_sample_test --gmock_verbose=warning
```

Expected result snippet:

```plaintext
[==========] Running 64 tests from 9 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Bar
[       OK ] FooTest.Bar (0 ms)
...
[----------] 64 tests from 9 test suites ran. (15 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 64 tests.
```

If any test fails, the log will provide detailed failure explanations.

## 5. Additional Validation Tips

- Use **GoogleTest flags** like `--gtest_filter` to focus on specific tests.
- Use **environment checks**: Make sure your compiler supports C++17 or higher as required.
- Regularly run the **sample tests** after updates to ensure integration remains intact.

## Troubleshooting Shortcut

If uncertain why tests are failing:

1. Run tests with verbose mock output:

```bash
./gmock_sample_test --gmock_verbose=info
```

2. Identify mismatched or unexpected calls indicated in the output.
3. Adjust mock expectations or test code accordingly.

<Check>
Ensure all tests run and pass with the standard test binary.
Check for "[  PASSED  ]" in test output.
Enable verbose mode with `--gmock_verbose=info` when debugging.
