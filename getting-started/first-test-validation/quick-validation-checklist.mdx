# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist provides you a clear, actionable way to verify your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup is functioning as expected before proceeding with test development. It distills the essential steps and expected outputs so you can confidently identify if your environment and installation are ready.

---

## 1. Verify Installation and Platform Compatibility

- Ensure your system supports the required platforms and compilers, as detailed in the [Supported Platforms & Requirements](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/supported-platforms-requirements) guide.
- Confirm your compiler supports at least C++17 and that required dependencies (e.g., pthread on Unix-like systems) are installed.
- On Windows, check for runtime linkage options like `gtest_force_shared_crt` to avoid linkage errors.

<Tip>
Running these environment checks upfront prevents build or runtime issues caused by platform incompatibilities.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Build and Link GoogleTest and GoogleMock Libraries

- Compile your project using your preferred build system (CMake or Bazel).
- Confirm that GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are correctly linked.
- Include the headers `<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test sources.

<Note>
Refer to the [Installing with CMake and Bazel](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-with-cmake-bazel) guide for detailed build instructions.
</Note>

---

## 3. Compile a Simple Test Program

- Create a minimal test source file, e.g.:  

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SanityCheck, TrueIsTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- Compile and link this file against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.

<Check>
If compilation fails, ensure all include and link paths are correctly configured.
</Check>

---

## 4. Run the Test Executable

- Run the compiled test binary.
- Observe the output; you should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck
[ RUN      ] SanityCheck.TrueIsTrue
[       OK ] SanityCheck.TrueIsTrue (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SanityCheck ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

- The `[  PASSED  ]` indicator confirms successful test execution and proper setup.

<Warning>
If tests fail or do not run, check that GoogleTest is properly initialized using `InitGoogleTest()`.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Validate GoogleMock Functionality

- Create a simple mock class and test to verify GoogleMock works as expected:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, DoIt, (int), ());
};

TEST(MockSanity, CallBehavior) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoIt(5))
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(10));

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.DoIt(5), 10);
}
```

- Run the test binary. Expect it to pass and verify that the mock expectations are enforced.

<Check>
Failures here could indicate improper inclusion of GoogleMock or incorrect mock method signatures.
</Check>

---

## 6. Use Diagnostic Flags If Problems Occur

- For verbose diagnostic output during mock method calls, run your tests with:

```
--gmock_verbose=info
```

- This helps trace expectation matching and identify mismatches or unexpected calls.

<Info>
Consider adjusting `--gmock_verbose` to `warning` or `error` to control message verbosity.
</Info>

---

## 7. Verify No Warnings About Uninteresting Calls

- When running your tests, check that you do not see "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings unless expected.
- If you do, and the calls are valid, consider wrapping mocks in `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress warnings for those methods.

---

## Summary of Success Criteria

- Test binary compiles without errors.
- Running tests show `[  PASSED  ]` for all tests including mocks.
- No linkage or runtime errors.
- Mocked methods respond and verify expectations as coded.
- No unexpected warnings about uninteresting calls unless deliberately allowed.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<Accordion title="Linker Errors or Missing Symbols">Ensure correct linkage against GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries. Check build system configuration references libraries properly.</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Support Issues">Verify compiler version supports C++17. See `Supported Platforms & Requirements` guide.</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Not Running or DISCOVERED">Verify `InitGoogleTest` is called in main, and test files are included in build targets.</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Methods Not Recognized">Confirm `MOCK_METHOD` macros are correctly declared in public section of mock classes, and include `<gmock/gmock.h>`.</Accordion>
