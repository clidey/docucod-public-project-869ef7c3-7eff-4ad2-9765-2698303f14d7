# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting

This page provides practical steps to verify that your GoogleTest setup is working correctly. It guides you through running your first tests, interpreting results, and quickly resolving common setup or build issues.

---

## 1. Validate Your GoogleTest Installation

After completing installation and integrating GoogleTest with your project, it's crucial to confirm everything is set up properly and that basic test execution works as expected.

### Step 1: Build the Sample Tests

If you've installed GoogleTest via CMake or Bazel, the source repository includes sample tests that you can compile and run immediately.

- **CMake:**
  - Follow the [Installing GoogleTest (CMake & Bazel)](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake-bazel) guide to compile.
  - Build the `googletest` and `googletest_samples` targets.
- **Bazel:**
  - See Bazel build instructions in the same guide.


### Step 2: Run the Test Binary

Execute the test binary created in the build step. By default, it runs all available tests and outputs the results to your console. For example:

```bash
./googletest_samples
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running X tests from Y test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] Z tests from FooTest
[ RUN      ] FooTest.TestName
[       OK ] FooTest.TestName (0 ms)
...
[  PASSED  ] X tests.
```


### Step 3: Confirm Successful Test Run

A successful test run shows:

- `[  PASSED  ]` messages for tests.
- The count of passed tests matches the number run.
- No `[  FAILED  ]` or error messages.


## 2. Interpret the Test Output

GoogleTest provides clear indicators about the status of your tests:

- `[       OK ]` means the individual test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ]` means an assertion or test has failed.
- `[  SKIPPED ]` indicates a test was skipped (via `GTEST_SKIP()` or configuration).
- Summary lines show total tests run, passed, failed, and skipped.

### Example: Interpreting a Failed Test Output

```
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
/path/to/factorial_test.cc:10: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(0)
    Which is: 0
  1
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (1 ms)
```

This example indicates that the test failed because the actual return of `Factorial(0)` was 0 instead of the expected 1.


## 3. Common Troubleshooting Checklist

When tests do not run or fail unexpectedly during setup or build, check the following:

### Build Issues

- **Compiler Support:** Ensure your compiler supports C++17, as required by GoogleTest.
- **Include Paths:** Confirm that GoogleTest header files are discoverable in your build settings.
- **Linker Settings:** Verify the GoogleTest static or shared libraries are linked correctly.
- **Build System Configuration:** If using CMake or Bazel, confirm your `CMakeLists.txt` or `BUILD` files include GoogleTest targets correctly.

### Run-time Issues

- **Test Discovery:** Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to confirm tests are detected:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
  ```

  This should list all available tests.

- **Test Filtering:** Verify that no restrictive filter is preventing tests from running, especially check the `--gtest_filter` flag.

- **Disabled Tests:** Remember tests with names beginning with `DISABLED_` will not run unless overridden.

- **Environment Variables:** Some platforms or CI environments require environment variables correctly set up for test execution.

- **Debugging Failures:** Use the `--gtest_break_on_failure` flag to stop execution on the first assertion failure (useful under a debugger).

### Skipping Tests

Tests may be skipped intentionally using `GTEST_SKIP()`. These are not failures but might require attention if unexpected.

### Event Listeners & Output Control

For advanced validation or customization, GoogleTest lets you add event listeners and control output verbosity and color. Refer to [Advanced Topics](../advanced.md) and [TestEventListener](../api-reference/gtest-api/test-event-listener) for details.


## 4. Quick Commands & Flags Overview

- Run all tests (default):
  ```bash
  ./test_binary
  ```

- List all available tests:
  ```bash
  ./test_binary --gtest_list_tests
  ```

- Run specific test(s) by name filter:
  ```bash
  ./test_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
  ```

- Run disabled tests:
  ```bash
  ./test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
  ```

- Stop after first failure:
  ```bash
  ./test_binary --gtest_fail_fast
  ```

- Enable colored output:
  ```bash
  ./test_binary --gtest_color=yes
  ```

- Generate XML report:
  ```bash
  ./test_binary --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
  ```


## 5. Resolving Common Errors

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Tests Found or Executed">
Check that your `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros are properly defined and that your files are compiled and linked correctly. Use `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm test detection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors">
Confirm that GoogleTest libraries are correctly linked, including dependencies and runtime libraries. Consult the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake-bazel).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Assertion Failures in First Tests">
Review the failure message output to identify incorrect expectations or faults in test code. Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` under a debugger for deeper investigation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Skipped Tests">
Skipped tests may be caused by `GTEST_SKIP()` calls or disabled tests (`DISABLED_` prefix). Review test code and invocation flags.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 6. Additional Validation Tips

- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times and detect flaky behavior.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order.
- For test shards (distributed testing), ensure environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` are set correctly.

### Example: Running Your Tests with Basic Validation

```bash
# Build your test binary
cmake --build . --target your_test_target

# Run all tests
./your_test_binary

# Confirm all tests pass
# If tests fail, investigate failure messages

# List tests to ensure test discovery
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests

# Run a specific test
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest

# Run disabled tests if necessary
./your_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests

# Generate XML report for CI integration
./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:test_results.xml
```

This validation workflow guarantees your testing framework runs effectively, your build environment is configured correctly, and enables rapid troubleshooting to minimize downtime and maximize confidence in your tests.
