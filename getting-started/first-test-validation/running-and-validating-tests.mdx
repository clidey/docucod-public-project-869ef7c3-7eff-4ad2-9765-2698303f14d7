# Running & Validating Tests

Ensure your GoogleTest and GoogleMock environment is correctly set up by running your test suite through the provided test runners or your preferred command-line interface. This page guides you through executing your tests, interpreting the outputs, and confirming your test environment works smoothly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Environment Check

Before running tests, confirm that:

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock are properly installed and compiled in your project.
- Your build system includes linking against `gtest` and `gmock` libraries.
- You have test binaries ready, either generated from your source or supplied.
- Your environment supports necessary runtime requirements.

<Tip>
If you are unsure about successful installation, refer first to the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/requirements-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements) and [Installing on Linux, macOS, and Windows](/getting-started/requirements-installation/installing-on-linux-macos-windows) guides.
</Tip>

## 2. Running Tests with GoogleTestâ€™s Built-In Test Runner

GoogleTest provides a built-in test runner that discovers and executes all registered tests in a test program. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Invoke Your Test Executable

Run your compiled test binary from a terminal or command line:

```bash
./your_test_binary
```

This will execute all tests defined using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or other GoogleTest macros.

### Step 2: Observe the Output

The runner will output a summary including:

- Names of each test suite and individual test executed.
- Pass/fail status for each test.
- Detailed failure messages for any assertions that fail.
- A final summary with total counts of tests run, passed, and failed.

Example output snippet:

```shell
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)

[ FAILED ] 1 test, listed below:
[ FAILED ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

<Tip>
To reduce verbosity, you may redirect output or use command line flags like `--gtest_filter` to run subsets of tests.
</Tip>

## 3. Using GoogleMock in Tests

If your tests include mocks, GoogleMock seamlessly integrates with GoogleTest.

### Step 1: Set Expectations Before Exercising Code

Always set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) on mock objects before you execute code that triggers their methods.

### Step 2: Run Tests Normally

Run the test binaries normally (same as above). GoogleMock automatically verifies if your mock expectations were met.

### Step 3: Interpreting Mock Verification Failures

If any mock expectations fail, test output will include detailed messages explaining:

- Which expected calls were not made or over-invoked.
- What argument mismatches occurred.
- The order violations, if applicable.

For example:

```shell
Expected call: MockFoo.DoThis(5) once
  Actual call: never called
```

<Tip>
For enhanced debug information when using mocks, add the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock call traces and matching expectations.
</Tip>

## 4. Understanding Exit Codes and Test Results

After running your tests, check:

- Exit code 0 indicates all tests passed.
- Non-zero exit codes indicate failures.

If you use test automation or CI pipelines, exit codes are crucial for automatic pass/fail recognition.

<Tip>
Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()` function to ensure correct exit signaling.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```
</Tip>

---

## 5. Debugging Common Test Run Issues

### Failed Test

- Review failure messages and stack traces.
- Check assertion messages and expected vs actual values.
- If using mocks, verify that expectations were set correctly before exercising code.

### Uninteresting Call Warning

- Message: "Uninteresting mock function call encountered - ..." means a mock method was called without an expectation set.
- To fix, either set appropriate expectations or convert mock objects to `NiceMock<T>` to suppress these warnings.

### Test Hangs or Crashes

- Check for infinite loops or deadlocks in your test or mocked methods.
- Use flags such as `--gtest_break_on_failure` to catch failures as they occur.

<Tip>
See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-test-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed guidance.
</Tip>

## 6. Advanced Test Running Options

### Run Selected Tests

Use the `--gtest_filter=` flag to run only specific tests:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
```

### Control Output Verbosity

Adjust mock output with `--gmock_verbose=`:

- `error`: Show only errors
- `warning`: Show warnings and errors (default)
- `info`: Verbose info, including mock call traces

### Parallel Test Execution

GoogleTest supports sharding or parallel runs with custom scripting to accelerate test suites.

---

## 7. Confirming Your Setup is Correct

### Verify Successful Execution

- All tests should pass without unexpected failures.
- No warnings about uninteresting mock calls unless explicitly using `NaggyMock`.

### Use Sample Tests

Try running example tests from the `googletest` or your project.

### Use Diagnostic Flags

- `--gtest_list_tests` to list discovered tests.
- `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed mock invocation logs.
