# Validating Your Installation

This page helps you verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are properly installed and function correctly in your environment. By following practical checklist steps, running basic commands, and inspecting expected test outputs, you will confirm a healthy setup ready for further test development.

---

## 1. Checklist Before Validation

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before running any validation tests:

- **GoogleTest and GoogleMock Installed:** Follow the installation guides (`Installing with CMake` or `Installing with Bazel`) to have both frameworks installed properly.
- **Compiler Supports C++17:** Confirm your compiler meets the minimum standards outlined in `System Requirements & Prerequisites`.
- **Build Tools Ready:** Tools like CMake or Bazel must be available and configured.
- **Your PATH and Environment Variables:** Necessary environment variables or paths are set to locate GoogleTest/GoogleMock binaries and headers.

<Tip>
Itâ€™s best to confirm your system compatibility first using the System Requirements guide before proceeding here.
</Tip>

## 2. Build and Run the Sample Validation Test

The fastest way to validate your installation is by building and running a simple sample test that uses both GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

### Step 1: Prepare a Simple Test File
Create a file called `sample_validation_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// A mock interface.
class MockFoo {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const));
};

// Sample test case using GoogleTest and GoogleMock
TEST(InstallationValidation, BasicMockTest) {
  MockFoo mock_foo;

  // Setup mock to return 42 when GetValue() is called
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, GetValue())
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  // Exercise mock
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_foo.GetValue(), 42);
}
```

### Step 2: Compile the Test
Build the test executable linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries. If you use CMake, a simple `CMakeLists.txt` might look like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(ValidateGTest)

# Find GoogleTest and GoogleMock packages (adjust paths if necessary)
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(sample_validation_test sample_validation_test.cc)

# Link with GoogleTest and GoogleMock
target_link_libraries(sample_validation_test GTest::gmock_main)
```

Run:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Step 3: Run the Test

Execute the built binary:

```bash
./sample_validation_test
```

You should see output indicating a successful run like this:

```plaintext
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from InstallationValidation
[ RUN      ] InstallationValidation.BasicMockTest
[       OK ] InstallationValidation.BasicMockTest (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from InstallationValidation (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
If you notice linker errors, double-check your build linking configuration.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Verifying Expected Output

When the test runs, the following confirms GoogleTest and GoogleMock are operational:

- The test suite `InstallationValidation` is discovered and executed.
- The mock method `GetValue()` matches the expectation with `.WillOnce(Return(42))` and returns 42.
- Assertions confirm that the mocked method returns the expected value.
- The overall test returns with `[  PASSED  ] 1 test.` indicating no failures or errors.

<Tip>
A failure here usually means installation or linking is incomplete or broken.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Basic GoogleMock Functionality Test

You can further validate mock behavior by adding expectations on call counts and argument matching, such as:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, GetValue())
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));
```

Running the test will verify GoogleMock intercepts calls, applies the right actions, and confirms call counts.

You should expect zero warnings regarding uninteresting calls when expectations match all calls.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Test Runner Cannot Find Tests">
- Verify that the test binary was built with GoogleTest linked.
- Make sure test cases are not disabled or filtered out via flags.
- Ensure the test binary is run with correct working directory if relative paths are used.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Methods Not Called as Expected">
- Check the use of `EXPECT_CALL` comes *before* the mock method is called.
- Confirm mock methods are `virtual` and overridden.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to log mock call trace for diagnosis.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on GoogleTest or GoogleMock Symbols">
- Confirm that linker flags include GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Validate paths used in build tools or environment variables.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Additional Validation Commands

If your GoogleTest/Bazel or CMake installation includes command-line utilities for tests, you can use:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

This lists all registered tests confirming discovery is functional.

Similarly,

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=InstallationValidation.BasicMockTest
```

runs only the specified test.

## 7. Next Steps

Once your installation is validated:

- Proceed to [Writing Your First Test](../first-test-validation/writing-basic-test) to learn test authoring.
- Explore [Compiling and Running Tests](../first-test-validation/running-tests) to deepen execution understanding.
- Check [Common Issues](../first-test-validation/common-issues) if you encounter setup problems.

<Tip>
Keep this validation test handy as a quick regression check for environment integrity.
