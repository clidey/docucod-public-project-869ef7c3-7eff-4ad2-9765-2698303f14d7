# Verifying Your Installation

This guide walks you through simple and reliable methods to confirm that GoogleTest is correctly installed and functioning in your environment. By compiling and running a canonical test, you will verify that the installation is complete and that GoogleTest works as expected. Additionally, you will learn how to interpret test results and troubleshoot common, immediate issues.

---

## 1. Quick Verification Using a Canonical Test

The most straightforward way to verify your GoogleTest installation is by compiling and running a minimal test program that exercises core GoogleTest functionality.

### Step 1: Create a Test Source File

Create a file named `sample_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test case verifying that basic assertions work.
TEST(InstallationTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_NE(1, 0);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This test contains a basic suite named `InstallationTest` with a single test verifying trivial assertions to confirm GoogleTest's runtime behavior.

### Step 2: Compile the Test

Compile the test source file and link it with GoogleTest and its dependencies. The exact compilation command depends on your platform and setup.

#### Example (using `g++` and pkg-config):

```bash
# Linux/Mac example with pkg-config

pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest_main

# Usually, the compile command can be:
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cc -lgtest_main -lgtest -pthread -o sample_test
```

> Replace or adjust the compilation flags as needed if you installed GoogleTest differently (e.g., via Bazel, CMake, or manually).

### Step 3: Run the Test Executable

Execute the binary:

```bash
./sample_test
```

The expected output is:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from InstallationTest
[ RUN      ] InstallationTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] InstallationTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from InstallationTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms that GoogleTest successfully compiled and ran a test.

## 2. Interpreting Test Results

- **PASSED tests**: If you see all tests passing, your installation works correctly.
- **FAILED tests**: If any tests fail, carefully examine the output to identify compilation or linkage issues.

  Typical failure scenarios include:
  - Missing or mismatched libraries
  - Incorrect include paths
  - Mismatched C++ standards

- **Test executable not found or fails to run**: Revisit your build and environment setup.

---

## 3. Troubleshooting Common Verification Issues

### Issue: Compilation Fails Due to Missing GoogleTest Headers or Libraries

**Solution:**
- Verify that the GoogleTest headers are in your compiler's include path.
- Verify that the GoogleTest libraries (`libgtest.a`, `libgtest_main.a`, or shared libs) are correctly linked.
- Confirm that the C++ standard is at least C++17, as GoogleTest requires it.

### Issue: Runtime Errors or Tests Not Running

**Solution:**
- Ensure your main() function calls `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- If linking against `gtest_main` is used, you donâ€™t need to supply your own `main()`.
- Check for mismatched versions or incompatible compilers.

### Issue: Tests Fail to Execute or Report Unexpected Output

**Solution:**
- Ensure that your environment variables and execution paths point to the correct test binary.
- Verify there are no conflicts between multiple versions of GoogleTest in your system.

## 4. Verifying GoogleMock Installation (Optional)

GoogleMock is bundled with GoogleTest but requires initialization to verify. You can use the included `gmock_output_test_.cc` as a canonical test.

### Step 1: Build and Run GoogleMock Tests (Optional)

Clone or locate `gmock_output_test_.cc` from the `googlemock/test` directory and compile it with GoogleMock and GoogleTest linked:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 googlemock/test/gmock_output_test_.cc -lgmock -lgmock_main -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o gmock_test
./gmock_test
```

A successful run means GoogleMock integrates correctly.

## 5. Best Practices for Installation Verification

- Always compile your verification tests with the same compiler and flags as your project to avoid ABI incompatibilities.
- Use verbose output (`--gtest_verbose=info`) if tests fail and you need detailed diagnostics.
- Keep your development environment clean to avoid conflicting GoogleTest or GoogleMock versions.

## 6. Next Steps

Once installation is verified:

- Proceed to write and run your first real tests by reviewing the **[Writing and Running Your First Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-test-validation/writing-running-first-test.md)** guide.
- Explore **[Configuring GoogleTest in Your Project](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/configuration-basics.md)** for customizing GoogleTest behavior.
- Consult **[Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/common-issues-troubleshooting.md)** if you encounter problems.

<Tip>
Always verify your test executable's exit code: a zero (`0`) means success; non-zero means failure. This helps integrate GoogleTest into CI/CD systems reliably.
</Tip>

<Note>
For convenience, GoogleTest supplies a `gtest_main` library that provides a ready-to-use `main()` function. Linking against it may simplify your build process.
</Note>

<Warning>
Ignoring failed installation verification tests can mask major setup problems. Fix all issues reported during verification before writing further tests.
</Warning>
