# Quick Validation Steps

Verify your installation and configuration by running sample tests. Follow these steps to conduct key checks to ensure your GoogleTest environment is functioning correctly.

---

## 1. Verify GoogleTest Installation

Before running tests, ensure that GoogleTest has been built and installed properly.

- Confirm that the GoogleTest libraries (`libgtest.a` or equivalent) have been compiled.
- If using CMake, verify that you have included GoogleTest correctly as a subdirectory or linked against the installed libraries.

<Tip>
If you have not yet completed the installation, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/prereq-install/installation-guide) for detailed, platform-specific instructions.
</Tip>

## 2. Compile a Sample Test

Create a simple test source file `sample_test.cc` to validate that the framework links and runs as expected.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A basic test case.
TEST(SampleTest, AlwaysPasses) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

Compile the test:

```bash
# Example for Linux with g++ and pkg-config
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o sample_test
```

<Tip>
Be sure to add any necessary include and library paths if GoogleTest is installed in a non-standard location.
</Tip>

## 3. Run the Sample Test

Execute the compiled binary:

```bash
./sample_test
```

Expected output:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.AlwaysPasses
[       OK ] SampleTest.AlwaysPasses (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
If the test passes as above, GoogleTest is installed and set up correctly.
</Tip>

## 4. Run the GoogleMock Sample Test

If you are using GoogleMock, you can write a simple mock test to validate the mocking framework setup.

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const));
};

TEST(MockTest, MockMethod) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetSize())
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(10));

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetSize(), 10);
}
```

Compile with:

```bash
# Include gmock and gtest, link with pthread
g++ -std=c++17 mock_test.cc -lgmock -lgtest -pthread -o mock_test
```

Run the test:

```bash
./mock_test
```

Expected output:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from MockTest
[ RUN      ] MockTest.MockMethod
[       OK ] MockTest.MockMethod (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from MockTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
This confirms your GoogleMock configuration works correctly.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Validation Checks

- **Correct linking errors?** Make sure you link with `-lgtest -lgtest_main` for GoogleTest and `-lgmock -lgmock_main` for GoogleMock.
- **Threading support:** Include `-pthread` on Linux/macOS as GoogleTest relies on threading.
- **C++ standard:** GoogleTest requires C++17 or higher for compatibility.

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to writing your first tests with the [Writing Your First Test](../first-test-run/create-first-test.md) guide.
- Explore test execution and reporting in [Building and Running Tests](../first-test-run/run-test.md).
- For advanced mock setup and usage, see the [Mocking Reference](../../reference/mocking.md) and [gMock Cheat Sheet](../../gmock_cheat_sheet.md).

## 7. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Link Errors or Missing Symbols">
Ensure the GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries are correctly built and linked.
Verify the linking order and include paths.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Runs but Fails to Detect Failures">
Confirm you compile and link your test binary with `-lgtest_main` or `-lgmock_main`.
Check that your test runner calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Compiler Version">
GoogleTest requires a C++17 compatible compiler.
Update your compiler or build environment if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Hang or Exhibit Race Conditions">
Make sure you provide the `-pthread` compiler flag.
Avoid modifying mock objects from multiple threads during expectation setup.
