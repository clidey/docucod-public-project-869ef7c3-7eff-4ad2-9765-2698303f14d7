# Quick Validation & First Success

This page guides you on how to recognize when your GoogleTest setup is successful, understand the various output formats on test execution, and quickly diagnose common issues if your tests do not pass on the first run. It empowers you to confidently confirm that GoogleTest is correctly installed and configured in your environment.

## Recognizing a Successful Test Run

After compiling and running your test executable (after following the installation and setup instructions), a successful run will typically display a series of messages reflecting the tests executed and their outcomes. These messages indicate that GoogleTest is functioning correctly.

### What to Expect

- Test cases are discovered and executed.
- For each test, you will see:
  - A `[ RUN      ]` line indicating the start.
  - A `[       OK ]` line indicating success, or `[  FAILED  ]` if a failure occurred.
- A summary showing how many tests were run, and how many passed or failed.


#### Sample Console Output for All Tests Passing

```plaintext
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FooTest
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Bar
[       OK ] FooTest.Bar
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Baz
[       OK ] FooTest.Baz
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Qux
[       OK ] FooTest.Qux
[----------] 3 tests from FooTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

You can confirm success if you see no `FAILED` tests and the final output shows `[  PASSED  ]` with the number of tests executed.


## Common Output Formats

GoogleTest supports various output formats and verbosity levels. You can configure this with command-line flags or environment variables.

### Text Output (Default)

This is human-readable and is printed directly to your terminal or console. It includes color-coded statuses if your terminal supports it (`--gtest_color=auto`).

### XML Output

By setting the flag `--gtest_output=xml` or `GTEST_OUTPUT=xml`, GoogleTest generates a detailed XML report file named `test_detail.xml` (or a custom name/path). This report includes detailed results for each test suite and test case with timestamps and failure messages.

Example usage:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_output=xml
```

The file can be used for CI integration or further analysis.

### JSON Output

GoogleTest also supports JSON report generation using:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_output=json
```

Similar to XML, this produces a detailed, structured JSON report of the tests and their results.

### Verbose and Brief Modes

- Use `--gtest_brief=1` to only print test failures to reduce output noise.
- Use `--gtest_verbose=info|warning|error` (via GoogleMock's verbose flag) to control message detail at runtime.

## What to Do If Tests Don't Pass on First Run

Getting an error or failing tests on the first run can stem from common issues. Here's how to quickly diagnose and fix them.

### 1. Confirm Basic Setup

- Have you correctly initialized the test framework by calling `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` in your `main()`?

- Are you actually compiling and linking with GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries?

- Check your compilation flags to ensure C++17 or higher is enabled.

### 2. Analyze the Failure Messages

GoogleTest produces descriptive failure messages which tell you what went wrong.

- For assertion failures, the output includes expected vs. actual values.

- For unexpected mock calls or unsatisfied expectations, GoogleMock prints details about the mismatched calls.

- If the failure messages are unclear, re-run your tests with verbose output enabled using:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This will print more diagnostic detail about mock expectations and calls.

### 3. Check for Common Pitfalls

- **Uninteresting Mock Function Calls:** If you get warnings about uninteresting calls, consider using `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors, or wrap your mock with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings.

- **Incomplete or Wrong Expectations:** Verify that your `EXPECT_CALL` clauses in the test match the actual calls your code makes.

- **Multiple or Missing Mocks:** If mocks depend on each other (e.g., delegation), ensure they are set up correctly.

- **Use of Unsupported Compiler Flags or Platforms:** Check the compatibility notes in the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](./getting-started/environment-installation/prerequisites-requirements) page.

### 4. Use Diagnostic Tools

- Run your tests with `--gtest_break_on_failure` to trigger debugger breakpoints on failure.

- Use `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` macros to write tests that validate your test helpers.

- Check the XML or JSON output for detailed failure context if console output is insufficient.

### 5. Consult Related Documentation and Community Resources

- [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](./getting-started/troubleshooting/common-setup-issues)
- [Community & Further Help](./getting-started/troubleshooting/community-resources)

## Practical Tips

- Ensure all your mock expectations and default actions are set adequately using `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL`.

- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests where preconditions are not met (e.g. missing environment).

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add trace points when debugging complex test failures.

- Remember that tests with names or suites prefixed with `DISABLED_` are skipped.

- After fixing issues, rerun your tests and verify the output matches the success indicators above.

## Example: Running GoogleTest and Interpreting Results

```bash
# Compile.
g++ -std=c++17 -I/path/to/googletest/include \
    -L/path/to/googletest/lib \
    my_tests.cc -lgtest -lgmock -lpthread -o my_test_binary

# Run tests.
./my_test_binary
```

Successful output snippet:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from MyTestSuite
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test1
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.Test1
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.Test2
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.Test2
[----------] 2 tests from MyTestSuite (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

If you instead see failures, the output will list each failed test with an error message, file location, and the reason for failure.

## Troubleshooting Common Failure Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Output Messages">  
<Accordion title="Unexpected Mock Function Call">  
When a test fails with an "Unexpected mock function call" message, it means there was a call to a mocked method that no existing `EXPECT_CALL` matched.  

**How to fix:**
  - Add or adjust an `EXPECT_CALL` to cover the missing invocation.
  - Check if the call order or arguments match expectations.
  - Use `ON_CALL` for setting default behaviors if the call is not meant to be verified.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Uninteresting Mock Function Call Warning">  
This occurs when a mock method is called but no related `EXPECT_CALL` exists.  

**How to fix:**
  - Use `ON_CALL` to set a default action.
  - Use `NiceMock<T>` wrapper to silence warnings for calls you want to ignore.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too Many or Too Few WillOnce() Actions">  
Warnings appear when the number of `WillOnce()` clauses doesn't match the expected cardinality.

**How to fix:** Ensure that the number of `WillOnce()` matches the expected number of calls or add `WillRepeatedly()` actions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Filtering Results in No Tests Run">  
If you use `--gtest_filter` but no tests run, GoogleTest warns.

**How to fix:**
  - Verify your filter matches existing test suite and test names.
  - Use wildcards like `*` wisely.
  - Run with `--gtest_list_tests` to list all available tests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
