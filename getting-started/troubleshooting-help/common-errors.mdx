# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting guide tailored to help you swiftly overcome typical setup issues encountered while integrating and using GoogleTest. Whether it’s linker troubles, missing headers, compilation errors, or integration bugs, this guide empowers you to solve these blockers and get back on track.

---

## 1. Linker Errors: Resolving Undefined Symbols

### Scenario
You see linker errors like `undefined reference to ...` when building your tests.

### Causes & Solutions
- **GoogleTest libraries not linked**: Ensure you link against `gtest` and, if using the default main, `gtest_main` libraries.
  ```cmake
  target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE gtest gtest_main)
  ```
- **Multiple gtest versions**: Verify your build environment is not mixing different GoogleTest installations or versions.
- **Missing static/shared library**: Confirm the library files exist in the standard or supplied library directories.

### Tip
Use verbose build logs (`make VERBOSE=1` or equivalent) to check the exact linker command and paths.

<Note>
Linker errors often manifest due to incomplete or missing link commands. Double-check your CMakeLists.txt or build scripts for proper inclusion of GoogleTest libraries.
</Note>

## 2. Missing Header Files

### Scenario
Compiler complains about missing includes like `gtest/gtest.h` or related headers.

### Causes & Resolutions
- **Header not found in include paths**: Add the path to your project's include directories.
  - When installed system-wide, this usually is automatic.
  - For local builds, add:
  ```cmake
  target_include_directories(your_test_target PRIVATE /path/to/googletest/include)
  ```
- **Incorrect or incomplete source tree checkout**: Ensure the entire GoogleTest source is fetched and intact.

### Tip
Run an IDE or compiler command with `-v` or `-E` preprocessing to check include search paths.

## 3. Compiler Incompatibilities and C++ Standard Issues

### Scenario
Compilation fails with errors related to language features or unsupported constructs.

### Causes & Solutions
- **C++ Standard Version**: GoogleTest requires at least C++17. Set your compiler accordingly.
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```
- **Unsupported compiler/platform**: Confirm your platform and compiler are officially supported. See the [Supported Platforms & Environments](overview/quick-start-integration/supported-platforms-environments) documentation.
- **Third-party tool conflicts**: Some static analyzers or restricted compilers may cause errors. Use standard compilers when building GoogleTest.

### Tip
Consult the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) for a complete compatibility matrix.

## 4. Integration Gotchas with Build Systems

### Scenario
You integrated GoogleTest but tests do not run or test cases are missing.

### Common Issues & Fixes
- **Not calling `InitGoogleTest()`**: Always call `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before running tests.

  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

- **Tests filtered out unintentionally**: Verify your test filters (`--gtest_filter`) if applied.

- **Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in same test suite**: GoogleTest requires uniform fixture classes in a test suite. Mixing these causes runtime failures.

- **Disabled tests not running**: Tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` are excluded unless run with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

### Best Practice
Write and build tests with consistent fixtures and ensure `InitGoogleTest` is always used properly.

## 5. Common Runtime Errors and Debugging Tips

### Test Failures Not Causing Termination
- Understand that `EXPECT_*` macros generate nonfatal failures allowing continuation.
- `ASSERT_*` macros generate fatal failures that abort the current test function.
- If unexpected behavior occurs due to fatal failure propagation, consider using helper functions like `HasFatalFailure()` to handle control flow.

### Using `SCOPED_TRACE`
Add informative tracing to pinpoint failures in subroutines or loops:

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Processing element " << i);
EXPECT_EQ(expected[i], actual[i]);
```

### Catching Failures in Test Utilities
Use `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` or `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` macros for testing GoogleTest assertions in your testing utilities.

## 6. Helpful Debugging Commands

### List All Tests
```shell
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

### Run Subset of Tests
```shell
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.*
```

### Enable Disabled Tests
```shell
./your_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

### Break on Failure
```shell
./your_test_binary --gtest_break_on_failure
```

- Official Documentation: [GoogleTest Primer](overview/introducing-googletest/product-purpose-value)
- Getting Started Guides: [Integration & Your First Test](getting-started/configuration-first-run/integration-and-first-test)
- Assertions Reference: [Assertions and Expectations](docs/reference/assertions.md)
- Advanced Usage and Troubleshooting: [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](docs/advanced.md)

<Tip>
For complex build issues, verify that your build system correctly propagates include and link directories. Using official build integrations like CMake or Bazel scripts provided by GoogleTest ensures smoother integration.
