# Next Steps & Further Resources

Congratulations on getting started with GoogleTest and GoogleMock! Now that you've successfully installed, configured, and run your first tests, this guide points you to the best resources and documentation pages to deepen your mastery and troubleshoot common challenges.

---

## 1. Explore Advanced Usage and Best Practices

GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer powerful, flexible testing capabilities. To leverage their full potential, dive into these advanced guides:

- **[gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)**: Learn practical recipes for mocking complex scenarios, delegating to fakes or real objects, handling move-only types, and controlling call order.

- **[Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html)**: Access detailed explanations of the `MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL` macros, matchers, actions, cardinalities, and mock object lifecycle management.

- **[Core Testing Workflows](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/core-testing-workflows/writing-assertions.html)**: Understand best practices for writing assertions, organizing tests with fixtures, and parameterizing them.


## 2. Troubleshoot and Resolve Common Issues

Disruptions during mocking and testing are natural learning points. Visit the following to get unstuck and optimize your tests:

- **[Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/troubleshooting-help/common-issues.html)**: Diagnoses typical problems such as unmet expectations, uninteresting calls, mock leaks, or compiler warnings.

- **[Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html)**: Answers to frequently asked questions collected over years of user experience.


## 3. Extend and Integrate GoogleTest in Your Development Workflow

Make GoogleTest a seamless part of your build and CI processes:

- **[Integrating with Build Systems (CMake and Bazel)](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/integration-scenarios/build-system-integration.html)**: Set up GoogleTest in your projects with best practices for dependency management.

- **[Continuous Integration Best Practices](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/integration-scenarios/ci-best-practices.html)**: Automate test execution in CI environments and optimize performance.


## 4. Engage with the Community and Support Channels

If you hit a wall or want to learn from fellow users:

- **[FAQ and Community Support](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/getting-started-and-common-issues/community-and-help.html)**: Find links to Stack Overflow, mailing lists, GitHub discussions, and other support forums.

- **GoogleTest GitHub Repository**: Report issues or contribute at [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).

## Additional Tips for Continued Success

- Use **`ON_CALL()`** for setting default/mock method behaviors without enforcing call counts. This keeps tests resilient and focused.

- Prefer **`EXPECT_CALL()`** only when you want to verify a method is called with specific arguments and cardinality.

- Take advantage of **`NiceMock`** and **`StrictMock`** wrappers to control warning verbosity on uninteresting calls.

- When working with asynchronous or complex test flows, consider **sequences** and **expectation order control** ([InSequence](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html#EXPECT_CALL.InSequence), [After](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html#EXPECT_CALL.After)).

- Regularly review **mock object life cycle** and **verification controls** (`Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations`) to ensure tests catch all contract violations.
