# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the essential platforms, tools, and dependencies necessary to prepare your environment for installing and building GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Verifying these prerequisites will ensure a smooth installation and integration process.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be highly portable and support a wide range of platforms. The most stable and tested platforms include the following:

- **Linux** (most distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants with certain limitations)
- **Mac OS X** (with Xcode support)
- **Cygwin**

Other platforms, such as AIX, FreeBSD, Solaris, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Haiku, Fuchsia, and embedded systems like ESP8266, XTENSA, and NRF52, are supported but may have less stable support due to limited access.

<Note>
If you work on less common platforms or embedded systems, some manual configuration may be required. We encourage reporting any issues to the GoogleTest community.
</Note>

## 2. Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a **C++17 compliant compiler** for successful build and operation. The following details are critical:

- **Minimum C++ standard**: C++17 (or later)
- **Examples of supported compilers:**
  - GCC 7 or later
  - Clang 3.9 or later
  - MSVC 2017 Update 3 (19.11) or later
- **C++ Standard Setting:** You must ensure your build environment passes the appropriate flag to use C++17:
  - For CMake projects, add:
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```
  - For manual compilation, use the respective compiler flag, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang.

<Warning>
Attempting to build with a compiler that does not fully support C++17 will result in errors. GoogleTest explicitly checks and requires C++17 or newer.
</Warning>

## 3. Build Tools and Systems

GoogleTest is primarily built using CMake, which orchestrates compiler and linker settings, handles dependencies, and generates native build files.

### Required Tools

- **CMake version 3.14 or later**
- **GNU Make** or compatible build tool for "/nix"-type systems
- **Visual Studio** (2017 Update 3 or newer) for Windows builds

You can download CMake for most platforms from <https://cmake.org/>.

### Build Systems

- **Standalone Build:** Clone the repository and use CMake to generate native build files, then build with your system's native tools.

- **Integration Build:** GoogleTest can be integrated via `add_subdirectory()` in existing CMake projects or imported via `find_package` if installed.

<Info>
If your project uses other build systems (e.g., Bazel), refer to the specific integration documentation for best practices.
</Info>

## 4. Dependencies

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require minimal external dependencies; however, some optional and environment-specific dependencies affect feature availability.

### Mandatory

- **Standard C++17 Library**
- **Standard C Library**

### Optional / Platform-aware

- **POSIX Threads (pthread):** GoogleTest detects and uses pthread when available for thread safety.
  - On Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, and other POSIX systems, pthread support is typically available.
  - If your environment does not automatically detect pthread or it is unavailable, you can force GoogleTest to enable or disable pthreads with the compile-time macro:
    ```
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  // Enable pthread
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  // Disable pthread
    ```

- **RE2 or POSIX Regular Expressions:** For supporting GoogleTest's internal regex usage.
  - RE2 support is used when Abseil library is available.
  - POSIX regex used on Unix-like systems.
  - Windows uses a more limited regex implementation built into GoogleTest.

- **Abseil (Optional):** If you build GoogleTest with Abseil, some features (e.g., advanced regex via RE2) are enabled.

### Build-time Macros

GoogleTest uses compile-time macros to tweak features:

- `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`: Build GoogleTest as a shared library
- `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`: Compile your tests to link against GoogleTest shared library
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=1` or `0`: Specify whether your compiler supports and enables C++ exceptions
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI=1` or `0`: Specify if Run-Time Type Information is available

Refer to `include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h` file for a complete list of macros.

<Note>
If unsure, rely on GoogleTestâ€™s default environment detection, which automatically defines these macros.
</Note>

## 5. Required Permissions and Environment

- You must have **read and write permissions** in your build directory.
- When installing GoogleTest system-wide, elevated permissions may be required (e.g., `sudo` on Linux/macOS).

## 6. Verifying Your Environment

Before proceeding with installation, verify your environment with the following checks:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify C++ Compiler Support">
Run your compiler to check the version:

```bash
# GCC example
g++ --version
```

Ensure it supports C++17.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify CMake Installation">
Check CMake version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

Must be 3.14 or newer.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for pthread Library (optional)">
On Unix-like systems, verify pthread presence by:

```bash
ldconfig -p | grep pthread
```

Alternatively, check GoogleTest auto-detection via build logs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Incorrect Compiler Flags:** Failing to set `-std=c++17` or equivalent will break the build. Always confirm your project configuration includes it.

- **Mixing Shared vs Static Runtime on Windows:** Visual Studio projects default to dynamic runtime linkage, while GoogleTest defaults to static runtime. Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align them.

- **Forcing Feature Macros:** If your platform detection is flawed, explicitly define feature macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` on the compiler command line.

- **Building with Abseil:** To get enhanced regular expression support and other features, build with Abseil dependencies.

- **Permissions Issue:** When installing globally on Linux/macOS, use elevated privileges.

<Warning>
GoogleTest requires thread safety mechanisms on platforms that support multi-threading. If targeting embedded or non-standard systems, threading support might be limited.
</Warning>
