# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin installing and using GoogleTest, ensure that your development environment meets the necessary prerequisites. This will guarantee a smooth build and integration experience.

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed as a cross-platform C++ testing framework and works reliably on:

- Linux distributions
- macOS
- Windows (including MinGW and Visual Studio environments)

<Check>
Verify your OS compatibility by ensuring your platform is one of the above-supported systems.
</Check>

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a compiler with support for the C++17 standard or later. Compatible compilers include but are not limited to:

- GCC 7.0 or newer
- Clang 6.0 or newer
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
- Intel LLVM Compilers supporting C++17

<Note>
GoogleTest enforces C++17 features as a minimum. Building with earlier standards will fail with errors.
</Note>

## 3. Essential Development Tools

You must have a basic development setup including:

- A C++17-compliant compiler as indicated above.
- CMake version 3.16 or newer for configuring and building GoogleTest.
- GNU Make, Ninja, or native build tools compatible with your OS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm C++17 support">
Run your compiler version check:

```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version

# Clang example
clang --version

# MSVC example
cl
```
Verify the output version meets or exceeds C++17 compatibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check CMake version">

```bash
cmake --version
```
Ensure it is version 3.16 or above.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Threading and Pthread Support

GoogleTest leverages multi-threading primitives when available:

- On POSIX platforms (Linux, Mac), it uses pthreads.
- On Windows, it uses native Windows threading APIs.

<Note>
MinGW's pthread support is often incomplete; GoogleTest disables pthreads under MinGW and relies on Windows threading.
</Note>

<Info>
If you need to forcibly enable or disable pthread support due to environment quirks, you can control this via `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` compiler flags when building.
</Info>

## 5. Development Environment Setup

- Ensure the compiler and build tools are correctly installed and accessible via your system's PATH.
- On Windows, installing Visual Studio with C++ workload is recommended.
- On macOS, installing Xcode command-line tools covers compiler and make system.
- Linux typically comes pre-equipped but verify your toolchain is updated.

## 6. Additional Notes on Runtime Libraries (Windows)

When building GoogleTest on Windows:

- By default, GoogleTest uses static linking of the C runtime libraries which prevents runtime conflicts.
- If your project uses dynamic runtimes, enable the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align GoogleTestâ€™s runtime linkage.

Example CMake command to enable this:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

<Warning>
Mismatch between runtime library linkage in GoogleTest and your project can cause linker errors like:

```text
error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'
```

Always set `gtest_force_shared_crt` appropriately to resolve such issues.
</Warning>

## 7. Summary Checklist

Before proceeding to installation:

- [ ] Confirm OS compatibility
- [ ] Confirm C++17 capable compiler is installed and default
- [ ] Confirm CMake 3.16+ is installed
- [ ] Ensure build tools (Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc.) are ready
- [ ] Verify threading support (pthread or native) as required
- [ ] On Windows, review runtime library linkage options

<Check>
Running `cmake --version` and `your_compiler --version` is an easy way to verify prerequisites quickly.
</Check>

For detailed platform and compiler support, consult the [Supported Platforms & Integration Points guide](/overview/architecture-audience-integration/platforms-and-integration-points).

For installation instructions following this setup, see [Installing on Linux, macOS, and Windows](/getting-started/requirements-installation/installing-on-linux-macos-windows).

For configuring the build environment and workspace, see [Workspace & Project Configuration](/getting-started/requirements-installation/workspace-configuration).

<Tip>
Ensuring your system meets these prerequisites avoids common build and runtime failures.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleTest requires standard filesystem capabilities and assumes a general-purpose OS environment; it is not targeted to embedded or highly restricted platforms.
</Note>

### Example: Verifying Compiler Supports C++17

```bash
# GCC
gcc -std=c++17 -dM -E - < /dev/null | grep __cplusplus

# Expected output:
# #define __cplusplus 201703L

# Clang
clang++ -std=c++17 -dM -E - < /dev/null | grep __cplusplus

# MSVC
# Using Developer Command Prompt:
cl /EHsc
# Check version in output to confirm support
```

### Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Found or Unsupported">
- Verify compiler is installed and in PATH.
- Ensure version supports C++17.
- Update or install newer compiler versions if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake Version Too Low">
- Download and install the latest CMake from https://cmake.org/.
- Use package manager or manual installer.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows">
- Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` in your CMake configuration.
- Confirm Visual Studio runtime settings match GoogleTest settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread Missing on MinGW">
- GoogleTest disables pthread on MinGW; rely on native Windows threads.
- Ensure you do not force pthread flags with MinGW.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Next Steps

Once you verify your system satisfies the requirements here, proceed to the installation instructions in [Installing on Linux, macOS, and Windows](/getting-started/requirements-installation/installing-on-linux-macos-windows). This will guide you through cloning, building, and validating your first GoogleTest setup.
