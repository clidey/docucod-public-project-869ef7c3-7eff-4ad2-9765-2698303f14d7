# System Requirements

This page outlines the minimum supported compilers, C++ language versions, operating systems, and environment considerations required by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Before installing or integrating these frameworks, verify that your development environment meets these compatibility requirements to ensure a smooth build and runtime experience.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standard and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require:

- **C++ Standard Version:** Minimum **C++17** support is mandatory. Your compiler must fully support C++17 features to build and use the frameworks.

- **Compiler Compatibility:**
  - **Clang, GCC, MSVC, Intel LLVM, and others** are supported provided they meet the C++17 standard.
  - On Microsoft Visual C++, at least **Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC version 19.11)** is required to compile GoogleMock.

### Practical Tip:
To ensure C++17 compliance in your build setup, explicitly specify the following in your CMakeLists.txt or build config:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Or pass the equivalent flag `-std=c++17` to your compiler.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed for broad cross-platform compatibility. Supported operating systems include:

- **Linux** (including popular distributions and variants)
- **Windows** (Desktop editions; includes MinGW and Visual Studio toolchains)
- **macOS** (including Xcode toolchain)

Additional platforms supported by GoogleTestâ€™s portability layer include:

- BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD)
- Solaris
- AIX

### Important Clarifications:
- GoogleTest has explicit support for Windows desktop but not for Windows Mobile or embedded Windows variants.
- For special embedded or mobile targets, verify your toolchain's ability to support C++17 and pthreads or equivalent threading.

## 3. Compiler and Threading Environment Details

### Compiler Flags Adjustments
GoogleTest and GoogleMock internally adjust compiler and linker flags to ensure:

- Strict warning levels (`/W4` on MSVC or `-Wall -Wshadow` on GCC/Clang).
- Exception handling is configured as needed.
- Runtime linking flags (static vs shared CRT on Windows) are consistent.

When building in your environment, be aware of these adjustments or conflicts if you override compiler flags manually.

### Threading Support
GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where **pthreads** is available and enabled. Your build environment must expose pthread support or equivalent, especially on Unix-like systems.

- GoogleTest detects pthread availability automatically.
- You can force pthread presence with compiler macros if automatic detection fails:

```cpp
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  // enable pthread use
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  // disable pthread use
```

If GoogleTest uses pthreads, your linker flags must include `-pthread` or the equivalent.

### Windows Threading
On Windows, GoogleTest uses Windows threading primitives by default, and does not rely on pthreads.

## 4. Additional Build Environment Considerations

- **Runtime Library Flags on Windows:**
  - GoogleTest prefers static linkage of the CRT when building static libraries to avoid duplicate runtime data.
  - If building shared libraries, ensure shared CRT linkage.
  - Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align your runtime library usage with GoogleTest when using Visual Studio.

- **Language Features:** GoogleTest disables RTTI and exceptions support detection at compile time via internal flags but will adjust accordingly for your environment.

## 5. Verification and Troubleshooting

### Verifying Compiler Support
Run the following minimal compilation to verify your compiler supports C++17:

```bash
echo 'int main() { return 0; }' > test.cpp
clang++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test
./test
```

Replace `clang++` with your compiler. Successful compile and run indicates C++17 support.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Compiler Version Too Old:** Older compilers without C++17 support will fail.
- **Mismatched Runtime Libraries on Windows:** Linking GoogleTest against mismatched CRT libraries causes link errors.
- **Pthread Not Linking:** If you see linking errors related to pthread functions, add the pthread flag to your build manually.
- **Unsupported Platform:** Embedded or mobile OSes without POSIX or Windows desktop threading may have limited support.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues, validate your environment against these requirements first. Official minimal compiler versions and platform support matrices are referenced in the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) document.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| C++ Standard              | C++17                      | Must be enabled in build system or manually   |
| Supported Compilers       | MSVC >= 2017 Update 3      | Minimum for GoogleMock compatibility           |
|                          | GCC, Clang, IntelLLVM      | With full C++17 support                         |
| Operating Systems         | Linux, Windows Desktop, macOS | POSIX compatibility or Windows threading
| Threading Library         | pthreads or Windows threading | For thread safety and internal use
