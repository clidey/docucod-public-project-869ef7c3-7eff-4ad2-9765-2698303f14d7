# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a minimum environment configuration to build and run correctly. This page details the minimum C++ standard, supported compilers, and platforms on which the frameworks have been tested and officially supported. Ensuring compatibility with these requirements guarantees a smooth integration experience and reliable test execution.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Version Requirement

GoogleTest and GoogleMock mandate **C++17** or later for both building and usage. This ensures access to modern language features and standard library enhancements that the frameworks rely on.

### How to Set C++17 in Your Build System

- **CMake**:
  Include the following in your `CMakeLists.txt` to enforce C++17:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- **Compiler Flags**:
  If your build system uses manual compiler flags, add:
  ```bash
  -std=c++17
  ```

### Compiler Compatibility Notes

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Update 3 (MSVC 14.0) or newer is required.
- GCC 7.1 or newer and Clang 5.0 or newer fully support C++17.
- Attempting to build with compilers earlier than this will result in compile errors (see below troubleshooting).

## 2. Supported Compilers

The following compilers have been verified and are officially supported:

| Compiler              | Minimum Version           | Notes                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **GCC**               | 7.1 or later              | Use `-std=c++17` flag                  |
| **Clang**             | 5.0 or later              | Use `-std=c++17` flag                  |
| **MSVC (Visual Studio)** | Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 (14.0) or later | Full compatibility from VS2017 onward|

The build system scripts (like CMake) automatically detect compiler versions and will emit errors if unsupported compilers are detected.

---

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide broad cross-platform support. The following platforms are tested and officially maintained:

| Platform                | Notes                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Linux (x86_64 and ARM)  | Broad support on common distros   |
| macOS                   | Tested with Xcode & clang
| Windows Desktop          | MSVC and MinGW support
| Android                 | Limited environment; with NDK & C++17 support
| Embedded Platforms       | Partial support (e.g., ESP32, NRF52 with Arduino)

### Platform-specific Considerations

- On embedded platforms like ESP8266 and ESP32, GoogleMock provides custom `setup()` and `loop()` functions instead of `main()`. This is explicitly coded in `gmock_main.cc`.
- Windows builds rely on MSVC quirks, and the system uses `main()` instead of `_tmain()` to avoid known linker bugs.

---

## 4. Multi-threading and Synchronization

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on systems where pthreads are available and enabled.
- Thread safety is detected automatically; if missing, synchronization primitives become no-ops.
- For pthread support, ensure `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` is defined and pthread libraries are linked.

---

## 5. Build System Integration

When using **CMake**:

- Default C++ standard is set to C++17.
- Compiler flags are tweaked to match platform defaults and platform-specific fixes (e.g., MSVC warnings, pthread linking).

Refer to GoogleTest's [README.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md) for detailed build instructions including how to configure CMake to build GoogleTest and GoogleMock on your platform.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Compiler too old**:
  You will see an error similar to:
  ```
  #error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
  ```
  Upgrade your compiler or specify C++17 explicitly.

- **Linker errors on Windows**:
  These may stem from runtime library conflicts or using `_tmain` instead of `main`. Always use the supplied `gmock_main` as entry point or link against `gmock_main` library.

- **Missing pthreads on Linux**:
  Add `-pthread` to your compiler and linker flags or enable pthread support in CMake.

- **Embedded environment warnings**:
  GoogleMock initializes differently on some embedded platforms (e.g., ESP32). Make sure your code accommodates their event loop model.
