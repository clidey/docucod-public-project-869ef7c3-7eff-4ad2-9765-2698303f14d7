# Quick Validation Checklist

Verifying your GoogleTest installation and environment setup is essential before diving into writing and running tests. This checklist provides a succinct set of practical commands and tips to confirm that GoogleTest is correctly installed and properly configured, empowering you to troubleshoot early and ensure a smooth testing experience.

---

### 1. Confirm Installation of GoogleTest Libraries

- **Locate GoogleTest Header Files**

  Ensure that the key header `gtest/gtest.h` is accessible in your compiler's include path.
  
  ```bash
  find /path/to/googletest -name gtest.h
  # Or ensure your build system includes googletest/include/
  ```

- **Verify GoogleTest Library Files**

  Check that the compiled library files (`libgtest.a` or equivalent) are present:
  
  ```bash
  ls /path/to/lib/libgtest* /path/to/lib/libgmock* 2>/dev/null
  ```

  If missing, refer to [Installing with CMake](getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake) for build instructions.

### 2. Confirm Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest requires **C++17 or later**. Verify your compiler meets this requirement.

```bash
# Example for GCC or clang
$ g++ --version
$ g++ -std=c++17 -E - < /dev/null
```

If you encounter errors related to C++ version, update your compiler or project configuration accordingly.

### 3. Compile and Run a Basic GoogleTest Sample

A proven way to confirm setup is to compile and execute a minimal test program.

Create a file `sample_test.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(BasicTest, SimpleAssertion) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and link (adjust includes and libs paths to your environment):

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cpp -I/path/to/googletest/include \
    -L/path/to/googletest/lib -lgtest -lpthread -o sample_test
```

Run the test executable:

```bash
./sample_test
```

Expected outcome:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from BasicTest
[ RUN      ] BasicTest.SimpleAssertion
[       OK ] BasicTest.SimpleAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from BasicTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

### 4. Verify GoogleTest Flag Parsing

GoogleTest recognizes numerous command-line flags controlling test execution and output. Test flag parsing:

```bash
./sample_test --gtest_list_tests
```

This should list the available tests and exit.

Try filtering tests:

```bash
./sample_test --gtest_filter=BasicTest.*
```

Try running with repeated execution to test flag support:

```bash
./sample_test --gtest_repeat=2 --gtest_fail_fast
```

### 5. Check for Common Setup Issues

- **Multiple C++ Runtimes**: On Windows, ensure your test and GoogleTest libraries use the same C++ runtime to avoid linker and runtime issues.
- **Include and Link Consistency**: Include the right headers (`<gtest/gtest.h>`) and link to appropriate libraries (`gtest`, `gmock` if using mocks).
- **Threading Support**: On platforms without pthreads or Windows without MinGW, thread safety may be limited.

### 6. Troubleshooting Steps

- If the test executable does not run or crashes immediately, confirm that:
  - The libraries are correctly linked.
  - The correct compiler flags are used, especially `-std=c++17`.
- If test discovery (`--gtest_list_tests`) fails, check include paths.
- Check for fatal or non-fatal failures by running tests normally.

### 7. Additional Checks (Optional)

- **Environment Variable Flags**: Ensure GoogleTest environment variables like `GTEST_FILTER` are unset or set correctly.
- **Check Compiler Macros**: For advanced verification, check macros like `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` via compiling small test snippets.
- **Test Output Color**: Use `--gtest_color=yes` to verify colored output support.

Performing this checklist will confirm your GoogleTest installation is ready for writing and running tests effectively.

### Tips

- Always call `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS();`
- Use `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros to define your tests.
- Start by printing the test list to verify your test suites are registered.
- Use a minimal test like `EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);` to verify core functionality.

This checklist provides quick, actionable steps to validate your GoogleTest environment and ensure operational readiness before deeper testing.
