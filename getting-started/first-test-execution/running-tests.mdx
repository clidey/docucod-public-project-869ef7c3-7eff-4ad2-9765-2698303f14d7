# Running & Validating Tests with GoogleTest

This guide walks you through building and running your test executables using GoogleTest. You will learn how to launch tests from the command line, interpret the test output, and verify a passing setup that confirms your environment is correctly configured. Essential command line options and practical examples are included to get you started immediately.

---

## 1. Building Your Test Executable

Before running tests, you must build your test binary. GoogleTest provides CMake build support to compile your test code along with GoogleTest libraries.

### Step 1: Configure Your Build with CMake

If you have added GoogleTest to your project (either downloaded manually or using FetchContent), make sure your `CMakeLists.txt` includes GoogleTest and your test sources, as shown below:

```cmake
# Enable C++17 standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Include GoogleTest
find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Add your test executable
add_executable(my_tests test_example.cpp)  # Replace with your test files

# Link with gtest_main to get the default main()
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gtest_main)

# Register the test with CTest
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

### Step 2: Build the Test Executable

In your project root:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..  # Configures your project, generating native build files
cmake --build .  # Builds your test executable
```

> Tip: On Unix-like systems, you can also run `make` if Makefiles are generated.

### Step 3: Verify the Build

Confirm that your test executable (e.g., `my_tests`) exists inside the build directory.


## 2. Running Your Tests

GoogleTest test executables are ordinary programs run from the command line. Running them executes all registered tests.

### Running All Tests

Simply run your test binary:

```bash
./my_tests
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.TestCase1
[       OK ] SampleTest.TestCase1 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.TestCase2
[       OK ] SampleTest.TestCase2 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.TestCase3
[       OK ] SampleTest.TestCase3 (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from SampleTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

This confirms your tests have run successfully.

### Expected Outcomes

- `[  PASSED  ]` indicates tests succeeded.
- `[  FAILED  ]` entries list any failed tests.
- A summary with counts of tests run, passed, and failed appears at the end.

### Running Specific Tests or Suites

To run a subset, use `--gtest_filter` with a wildcard pattern:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=SampleTest.TestCase1
```

or multiple tests separated by a colon `:`:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=SampleTest.TestCase1:OtherTest.*
```

Negate tests with `-`:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=*-SampleTest.TestCase3
```

You can combine positive and negative filters as needed.

### Listing Available Tests

To list all available tests without running them:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
```

Output format:

```
SampleTest.
  TestCase1
  TestCase2
  TestCase3
OtherTest.
  FirstTest
  SecondTest
```

## 3. Understanding Test Output

### Key Output Elements

- **Test Run Start and End**: Indicates when tests start and finish.
- **Test Case Run and Status**: Each test case runs and is marked `[ RUN      ]` and either `[       OK ]` or `[  FAILED  ]`.
- **Failure Details**: For failed tests, GoogleTest prints the assertion location, values, and failure messages.
- **Summary**: Overall total tests run, passed, and failed.

### Example of Failure Output

```
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.TestThatFails
path/to/test_file.cc:42: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  x
    Which is: 5
  y
    Which is: 6
[  FAILED  ] SampleTest.TestThatFails (0 ms)
```

This tells you exactly where and why the test failed.

### Tips for Interpreting Common Output

- If all tests are `[       OK ]`, everything passed.
- If you see `[  FAILED  ]`, check the file and line number for the failing assertion.
- Disabled tests (names prefixed with `DISABLED_`) will not run unless explicitly enabled.

## 4. Validating Your Setup

To confirm your GoogleTest environment works end-to-end:

1. Build and run the sample tests included in GoogleTest (or your simple custom tests).
2. Confirm the test output shows `[  PASSED  ]` for all tests.
3. Use `--gtest_list_tests` to see all discoverable tests.
4. Run selective tests with `--gtest_filter` to ensure filter functionality.

If all above works, your GoogleTest installation and environment are correctly configured.

## 5. Essential Command Line Flags

| Flag                         | Purpose                                    |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_list_tests`          | Lists all tests without running them.      |
| `--gtest_filter=<pattern>`    | Runs only tests that match the filter.     |
| `--gtest_repeat=<count>`      | Repeats tests multiple times.               |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`    | Stops test execution on the first failure. |
| `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` | Includes disabled tests in execution.       |
| `--gtest_color=<value>`       | Controls colored output: `yes`, `no`, `auto`. |

Use `--help` with your test executable to list all supported flags.

```bash
./my_tests --help
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Running Tests">
<Accordion title="Test Executable Fails to Run or Not Found">
Check if your executable was built successfully and is in the expected directory. Confirm permissions to execute the binary.

Verify your build setup and rebuild if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Tests are Run or Tests Not Recognized">
Ensure your tests are properly defined using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
Make sure that your executable is linked to `gtest_main` or that you provide a `main()` calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

Check if you accidentally prefixed test names with `DISABLED_`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Test Failures or Weird Output">
Verify that your test code is correct and assertions reflect expected behavior.
Run tests individually to isolate failures using `--gtest_filter`.

Consult detailed failure messages and stack traces.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

With this guide, you are equipped to build, run, filter, and verify your tests confidently using GoogleTest. Your next step is to write or import tests and watch them run smoothly under your setup.


---

<Check>
Make sure you have called `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` if you manually write it.
</Check>

<Check>
Use the `gtest_main` library if you prefer not to write a `main()` function yourself.
</Check>

<Check>
Always confirm your test executable runs and prints the expected test summary after execution.
