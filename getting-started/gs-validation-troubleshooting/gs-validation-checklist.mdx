# Validating Your Setup

This page helps you verify that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation and configuration are correct before you start writing your own tests. It provides a checklist to quickly confirm that the framework is properly installed, linked, and ready to run the provided example tests. By following these steps, you will ensure you're on the right track for a smooth testing experience.

---

## 1. Confirm Installation

Ensure that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are installed on your system and accessible to your project.

### Steps:

- **Check Include Paths:** Verify that your build system includes the paths to the GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers (`<gtest/gtest.h>`, `<gmock/gmock.h>`).

- **Check Libraries:** Confirm that you are linking against the correct GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries (for example, `gtest`, `gmock`, `gtest_main`, or `gmock_main`).

- **Verify Build Tools:** Confirm that your compiler supports C++17 or later, as GoogleTest requires this.

<Tip>
Using `find` or IDE search can help you quickly locate header files and library binaries.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Run Provided Example Tests

GoogleTest includes sample tests that serve as a baseline to confirm a working setup. Running these tests verifies everything from compilation through execution.

### How to Run Example Tests:

1. **Locate the Sample Test Binaries:** Examples are typically included in your installation or repository under `googletest/samples`.

2. **Compile the Sample Tests:** Using your build system (CMake, Bazel, or Make), compile the sample test binaries. An example compilation with `g++` might be:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include \
    -pthread sample1.cc -o sample1 \
    /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgmock.a -lgtest_main -lgmock_main
```

3. **Run the Tests:** Execute the binary:

```bash
./sample1
```

4. **Check Output:** Confirm that all tests pass. The expected output ends with something like:

```text
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesBlah
[       OK ] SampleTest.DoesBlah (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesFoo
[       OK ] SampleTest.DoesFoo (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesBaz
[       OK ] SampleTest.DoesBaz (0 ms)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

<Tip>
If any tests fail, carefully review the build and link configuration to ensure the correct libraries and headers are used.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Interpreting a Successful Output

A successful test run indicates your setup is working. Tests will report each test name with `[       OK ]`. The total summary shows `[  PASSED  ]` with the number of tests.

**Key success indicators:**

- Tests complete without crashes or abnormal termination.
- No `undefined reference` or linking errors during compilation.
- No warnings about missing expectations or uninteresting calls for the samples.

<Tip>
Running with `--gtest_verbose=info` can help you debug or understand the test flow if issues arise.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Run the Provided Examples in Your Environment

To fully confirm your setup:

- Add the provided example test cases from the GoogleTest samples to your build.
- Run them in your normal workflow.
- Review outputs to ensure they match expected test results.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Compilation Errors
- Ensure compiler supports C++17.
- Verify include paths and library link flags.
- Check for missing or misnamed files.

### Issue: Linking Errors
- Confirm linking against `gtest`, `gmock`, and optionally `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`.
- Verify library paths.

### Issue: Runtime Errors or Failures
- Run with `--gtest_break_on_failure` to catch where errors occur.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to view detailed mock call tracing.

### Issue: Unexpected Test Failures
- Confirm no test code is executed before setting expectations.
- Check mocking expectations vs actual calls.

## 6. Next Steps

Once you have validated your setup:

- Proceed to [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/gs-configuration-first-test/gs-first-test.md) to create simple tests.
- Learn about [Using Mocks in Tests](/getting-started/gs-configuration-first-test/gs-mock-first-steps.md) for introducing GoogleMock mocks.
- Explore the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) to understand verification macros.
- Visit [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/gs-validation-troubleshooting/gs-troubleshooting-common-issues.md) if you encounter problems.
