# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure that your GoogleTest setup is working correctly before diving into writing and running your own tests. This checklist helps you verify includes, linkages, environment setup, and confirms that a known-good test runs successfully to rule out local issues.

---

## 1. Verify Include Paths and Linking

- **Check that you include GoogleTest headers correctly:**

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

- **Ensure your project is linked against GoogleTest libraries.**

  - If you use CMake, confirm that your target links with `GTest::gtest` or `gtest`.
  - If manually building, verify that GoogleTest static or shared libraries are linked properly.

- **Confirm that the compiler can find GoogleTest headers and libraries.**

  - Use your compiler's verbose mode to check include and link paths.

<Tip>
Missed includes or linkage errors can cause compilation or runtime failures. Fix these first to enable test execution.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Verify Environment and Initialization

- **Confirm you initialize GoogleTest properly in your `main()` function:**

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- **Ensure command-line flags (like `--gtest_filter`, `--gtest_output`) are parsed by `InitGoogleTest`.**

- **Check for environment variables affecting test runs:**

  - `GTEST_FILTER` for test selection
  - `GTEST_REPEAT` for repeating tests
  - `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` and `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` for sharding

- **Ensure you are not unintentionally filtering out all tests.**

<Warning>
If no tests are linked in your binary or none match the filter, GoogleTest will print an error and exit. Double-check your test definitions and filter settings.
</Warning>

## 3. Run a Known-Good Minimal Test

Create and run a minimal test to verify your GoogleTest installation and environment.

Create a file named `basic_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(BasicTest, AlwaysPasses) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

Build your test binary and run it:

```shell
./basic_test
```

Expected output snippet when successful:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from BasicTest
[ RUN      ] BasicTest.AlwaysPasses
[       OK ] BasicTest.AlwaysPasses
[----------] 1 test from BasicTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
A successful run above confirms your includes, linking, and basic setup are correct.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If the test executable runs but finds no tests, verify that you have defined tests correctly and they are not disabled (with `DISABLED_` prefix or filters).
</Warning>

---

## 4. Validate Test Discovery and Filtering

- Run your tests with `--gtest_list_tests` to see discovered tests without running them:

```shell
./basic_test --gtest_list_tests
```

- Output example:

```
BasicTest.
  AlwaysPasses
```

- Use `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests. For example, to run only `BasicTest.AlwaysPasses`:

```shell
./basic_test --gtest_filter=BasicTest.AlwaysPasses
```

- Make sure your filters are correctly specified to avoid unintentionally skipping tests.

---

## 5. Enable Diagnostic Output for Failures

- By default, GoogleTest provides detailed failure output.

- You can control output verbosity with flags:
  - `--gtest_brief=1` shows only failures.
  - `--gtest_print_time=0` disables time measurement printing.
  - `--gtest_color=yes|no|auto` enables or disables colored output.

- Run your tests with `--help` to see available options.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="No Tests Discovered">

- Check that your test functions are correctly defined with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names, as per GoogleTest guidelines.
- Confirm the test files are compiled and linked into your executable.
- Verify that test filters do not exclude everything.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Runs but Prints ‘No Tests Found’ or Exits Immediately">

- Verify that you called `InitGoogleTest()` in `main()` before calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Check for conflicting command-line flags or environment variables.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Related to GoogleTest">

- Confirm that you link your test binary against GoogleTest libraries.
- If using CMake, ensure `target_link_libraries(your_test PRIVATE GTest::gtest)` is set.
- Make sure compiler and linker paths include GoogleTest's output build directory or installed location.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Assertion Failures Not Triggering Test Failure">

- Check that you never ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Avoid returning from your test function early unless using `ASSERT_*` macros.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Confirming Success Metrics

After running tests:

- GoogleTest summary prints how many tests ran, passed, skipped, or failed.
- Example:

```
[==========] 10 tests from 2 test suites ran. (2 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 10 tests.
```

- Passing all tests without failures confirms your setup and environment.

- Review skipped/disabled tests count to identify tests that may need attention.
