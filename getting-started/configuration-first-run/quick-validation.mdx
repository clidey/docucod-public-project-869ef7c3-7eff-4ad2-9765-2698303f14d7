# Quick Setup Validation

Ensure your GoogleTest installation and configuration are correct before diving into writing extensive tests. This guide helps you run a simple test, verify the output, and troubleshoot early issues to confirm readiness.

---

## 1. Write a Sample Test

Create a minimal test file to verify your GoogleTest setup. This will help you confirm that integration and linking have been performed correctly.

```cpp
// Filename: sample_test.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Define a simple test case.
TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Expect equality between 1 and 1
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);

  // Expect string equality
  EXPECT_STREQ("hello", "hello");
}
```

### Tips
- Ensure you include `gtest/gtest.h` in your test source file.
- Use the `TEST` macro to define a test case and test name.

---

## 2. Build the Test Program

Make sure to properly link against GoogleTest libraries (`gtest` and `gtest_main` if you use the provided main).

### Example (using g++ on Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Compile the test source
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include \
    -pthread sample_test.cpp /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a -o sample_test
```

### CMake Example

Add this to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
enable_testing()

add_executable(sample_test sample_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(sample_test gtest gtest_main pthread)
add_test(NAME sample_test COMMAND sample_test)
```

---

## 3. Run the Test Executable

Run the executable in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
./sample_test
```

### Expected Output

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This output confirms that GoogleTest is working correctly.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you get linker errors regarding `gtest` symbols, verify the library paths and linking flags.
- If `gtest` headers cannot be found, confirm include paths.
- On Windows, ensure runtime libraries (e.g., MSVC redistributables) are installed.

---

## 4. Verify Test Execution Behavior

GoogleTest executions can be customized and controlled via flags.

### Common Flags

- `--gtest_list_tests`: List all available tests without running them.
- `--gtest_filter=SampleTest.BasicAssertions`: Run only the specified test(s).
- `--gtest_color=yes|no|auto`: Force colored output on or off.
- `--gtest_repeat=N`: Run tests N times; use -1 for infinite repetition.

### Example Running with Filter and Color

```bash
./sample_test --gtest_filter=SampleTest.* --gtest_color=yes
```

---

## 5. Early Troubleshooting Guide

If running your sample test fails, consider the following checks:

### Common Issues

- **Missing or incorrect include paths**: Make sure your compile command includes the path to `gtest/include`.
- **Linker errors with gtest**: Confirm you are linking `libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a` or their shared versions.
- **Runtime errors or crashes**: Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to break on assertions.
- **Tests not running or no output**: Verify usage of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your main or use `gtest_main` library.

### Verifying Installation

Run `ldconfig -p | grep gtest` (Linux/macOS) or equivalent to check that the `gtest` libraries are installed and accessible.

## 6. Next Steps

Once your sample test runs successfully and outputs the expected result, continue your GoogleTest journey with:

- Writing your first custom test cases and test fixtures.
- Exploring [Writing & Running Your First Test](../getting-started/configuration-first-run/first-test.md).
- Advanced assertions and matchers for expressive testing.
- Integration with your build system and CI pipelines.

<Tip>
For complex build environments, start with a standalone sample test and incrementally add your project's source and dependencies.
</Tip>

<Note>
Running with `--gtest_list_tests` can confirm that your tests are discovered correctly.
</Note>

<Warning>
Avoid mixing different versions of GoogleTest libraries and headers as this may cause runtime failures or confusing build errors.
</Warning>
