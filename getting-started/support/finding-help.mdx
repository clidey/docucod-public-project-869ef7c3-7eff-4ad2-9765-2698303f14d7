# Getting Help & Further Resources

GoogleTest is designed to be a comprehensive C++ testing and mocking framework. While this guide gets you started with installing, configuring, and running your first tests, there may be times when you need additional information or encounter challenging issues. This page directs you to the key resources for deepening your understanding, troubleshooting problems, and engaging with the community.
