# Quick Validation Steps for Your GoogleTest/GoogleMock Setup

This page guides you through essential checks to confirm that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup works correctly. It provides practical example invocations, outlines expected outputs, and helps you interpret results to quickly identify and resolve common misconfigurations.

---

## 1. Why Validate Your Setup?

Before writing extensive tests, it's critical to verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly installed, configured, and operational in your environment. Quick validation steps help catch configuration or build errors early, ensuring your development efforts build on a reliable foundation.

## 2. Prerequisites

- You must have successfully installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock, following your platform-specific instructions (e.g., via CMake or Bazel).
- Your test executable must be compiled and linked against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Have access to your build system's command line to run the test binaries.

If you haven't installed yet, please refer to [Installation with CMake](../../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake) or [Installation with Bazel](../../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-bazel) guides.

## 3. Running the Quick Setup Verification Tests

GoogleTest includes supplied tests to confirm your setup behaves as expected, notably tests that validate `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` lifecycle behavior.

### 3.1. Locate Test Executable

After building GoogleTest, find the `googletest-setuptestsuite-test_` executable, typically under the `googletest/test/` directory or your build output folder.

### 3.2. Run the Test Executable

Execute the test binary:

```bash
./googletest-setuptestsuite-test_
```

### 3.3. Expected Output

You should see output indicating test failures on specific test suites named `SetupFailTest` and `TearDownFailTest`. Example snippet:

```none
[  FAILED  ] SetupFailTest: SetUpTestSuite or TearDownTestSuite
[  FAILED  ] TearDownFailTest: SetUpTestSuite or TearDownTestSuite

  2 FAILED TEST SUITES
```

These failures are intentional and confirm that GoogleTest properly reports failures in test suite setup and teardown phases.

<Tip>
If you do not see these failures or the output differs significantly, it may indicate your GoogleTest build or runtime environment has issues that need addressing.
</Tip>

## 4. Interpreting Results and Common Issues

| Symptom                     | Explanation                                                        | Action/Evernote                                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No test executable found     | GoogleTest was not built or built output path unknown             | Verify build success and locate test binaries per your build system guidelines |
| Test runs with no failures    | Setup/teardown test may be missing or not linked                   | Check that the test sources are included and linked. Alternatively, write your own validation test as described below |
| Test binary crashes or hangs | Build or environment misconfiguration, missing dependencies       | Ensure linked libraries match your compiler and platform; check for runtime environment issues |

## 5. Writing Your Own Minimal Validation Test

If for any reason the supplied test is unavailable, you can create a simple test source to verify GoogleTest correctly runs tests and reports setup failures.

Example test file `simple-validation-test.cc`:

```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class FailSetupTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    ASSERT_EQ(1, 2) << "Intentional setup failure";
  }
};

TEST_F(FailSetupTest, DummyTest) {
  SUCCEED();  // This test will not run because setup fails.
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Build and Run

Compile with:

```bash
# Example with g++ and pkg-config for GoogleTest
g++ -std=c++17 simple-validation-test.cc -o simple-validation-test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtest_main) -pthread
```

Run the test:

```bash
./simple-validation-test
```

Expected to see a failure caused by `SetUpTestSuite()` asserting false.

<Tip>
Use this minimal validation when debugging your GoogleTest integration or verifying environment correctness.
</Tip>

## 6. Understanding Test Output Details

GoogleTest summarizes test execution in a human-readable format showing:

- Total tests run, passed, failed, or skipped.
- Detailed messages for failures including file, line number, and failure reason.
- Stack traces if enabled.

Review the console for the following markers:

- `[  PASSED  ]` indicates successful tests.
- `[  FAILED  ]` indicates failed tests.
- `[  SKIPPED ]` indicates tests skipped intentionally (e.g., via `GTEST_SKIP()`).

Failures in `SetUpTestSuite()` or `TearDownTestSuite()` will be reported with clear markers specifying the test suite name.

## 7. Tips for Reliable Validation

- Ensure that test names' suites and fixtures follow GoogleTest naming restrictions (avoid underscores in test suite and test names) to prevent runtime issues.
- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your test executable's `main()`.
- Use `ASSERT_*` in `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to catch setup errors.
- Keep your GoogleTest libraries and header files in sync, especially when upgrading versions.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Test Executable Runs but No Tests Execute">
Make sure your test cases are properly linked and registered. Check for typos or mismatches in test declarations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Passes for Failing Setup">
Verify that your setup function (`SetUpTestSuite`) uses fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) rather than non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`). Fatal assertions cause test abort and proper failure reporting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Involving GoogleTest Symbols">
Check your build configuration, ensure GoogleTest libraries are linked. Confirm compiler and linker flags for threading support (e.g., `-pthread`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing or Outdated GoogleTest Binaries">
Rebuild GoogleTest and your tests from scratch to avoid stale or incompatible artifacts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 9. Next Steps

After successful validation, proceed to write your own tests following the guide:

- [Write and Run Your First Test](../../getting-started/configuration-first-run/write-first-test)
- [Quick Start: Using GoogleMock](../../getting-started/configuration-first-run/quick-start-mocking)

Enhance test suites by organizing fixtures aptly and leveraging advanced GoogleTest functionalities.
