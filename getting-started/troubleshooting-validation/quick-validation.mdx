# Validating Your GoogleTest Setup

Use sample tests or provided validation steps to confirm your environment and configuration. Learn how to quickly check that GoogleTest is working before deepening your investment.

---

## 1. Introduction

Before fully integrating GoogleTest into your C++ project, it's crucial to validate that your setup is functional. This page guides you through quick verification steps, including running sample tests and interpreting test output, to ensure your environment and configuration are correct.

Validating early saves time and prevents debugging complex integration issues later.

---

## 2. Quick Validation Workflow

Follow these practical, step-by-step instructions to confirm GoogleTest operates correctly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Build or Download a Sample Test">
Obtain a minimal GoogleTest sample test either by downloading from the repository or creating a simple test file as shown below.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile this with your configured build system ensuring GoogleTest libraries and headers are properly linked.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Sample Test">
Execute the compiled binary.

Expected output on success:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

Confirm that the tests pass without failures.
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Results and Logs">
- If all tests pass, your GoogleTest installation and configuration are validated.
- If tests fail or the binary does not run, see the troubleshooting section below.
</Step>

</Steps>

## 3. Sample Test Details

You can create a simple test file named `sample_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(ValidationTest, IntEquality) {
  EXPECT_EQ(42, 42);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Compilation Example

Using `g++` with C++17 standard for Linux/macOS:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o sample_test
```

For CMake or Bazel, ensure GoogleTest target is linked properly (refer to [Installing GoogleTest](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-methods)).

### Running the Test

```bash
./sample_test
```

Check for test pass confirmation as shown above.

## 4. Common Validation Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Test Fails to Compile or Link">
- Ensure GoogleTest headers and libraries are correctly installed and accessible.
- Verify your compile commands include necessary flags and library paths.
- Check C++ standard compatibility (e.g., C++17) with GoogleTest.
- When using Bazel or CMake, verify that the GoogleTest dependency is properly declared.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Runs But Produces Errors or Crashes">
- Confirm all test files include `#include <gtest/gtest.h>`.
- Make sure to call `::testing::InitGoogleTest()` in your main function.
- Verify that no conflicting versions of GoogleTest exist in your environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests Run But Do Not Detect Failures Correctly">
- Confirm that all mock objects or test fixtures are properly destroyed to trigger verification.
- For mock tests, ensure expectations are set before exercising code.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get detailed logs for debugging.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Uninteresting Mock Function Call Warnings">
- These warnings mean mock methods were called without explicit `EXPECT_CALL` set.
- Add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method).Times(AnyNumber())` if you want to suppress warnings.
- Use `NiceMock<MockClass>` to suppress warnings for a whole mock object.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag at different levels (`info`, `warning`, `error`) to control the verbosity of mock warnings and information messages while running tests.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Verifying Mock Objects

To force verification of mock expectations before destruction (useful if your mock object has complex ownership):

```cpp
using ::testing::Mock;

Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

This will check if all expectations were satisfied and report failures immediately.


## 6. Next Steps & References

- After validation, proceed with [Configuring Your Project for GoogleTest](/getting-started/configuration-first-test/project-setup) to integrate tests into your build.
- Explore [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/configuration-first-test/first-successful-run) to start authoring practical tests.
- If you use mocks extensively, consult the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for advanced mocking techniques.
- For deeper understanding of expectations and matchers, see the [Mocking Reference](/docs/reference/mocking.md) and [Matchers Reference](/api-reference/advanced-behaviors/argument-matchers.html).

---

## 7. Additional Tips

- Always set expectations before exercising the code under test.
- Use small, focused validation tests to narrow down problems quickly.
- Catch and read error messages closely; they point to specific setup problems.

## Appendix: Sample Validation Command Flags

```bash
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=info  # Enables detailed info logs
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=warning  # Warnings only
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=error  # Errors only
```
