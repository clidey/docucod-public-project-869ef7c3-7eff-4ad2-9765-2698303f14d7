# Validating Your Installation

Quick steps to confirm that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly installed and your test environment is reliable—ensuring a smooth foundation for all future test development.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before validating your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Compiler Support:** Confirm your C++ compiler supports at least the C++17 standard.
- **Dependencies:** Make sure GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and libraries are correctly included or linked in your environment (via CMake, Bazel, or other build systems).
- **Build Setup:** Verify that your build system is configured to find the GoogleTest and GoogleMock sources or installed paths.

<Check>
If you are unsure about your environment setup, please review the following before proceeding:
- [System Requirements](../getting-started/installation-prerequisites/system-requirements)
- [Installation Methods](../getting-started/installation-prerequisites/installation-methods)
- [Basic Configuration](../getting-started/installation-prerequisites/basic-configuration)
</Check>

## 2. Compile and Link a Minimal Test

The most straightforward way to validate your installation is by compiling a minimal test program that includes GoogleTest and GoogleMock and runs successfully.

### Step-by-step instructions:

1. Create a test file named `validate_install_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A trivial test case that always passes.
TEST(ValidateInstallTest, Basic) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

2. Compile this test program using your build system. For example, using `g++` (adjust paths accordingly):

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 validate_install_test.cc -I/path/to/googletest/include -I/path/to/googlemock/include \
    -L/path/to/lib -lgmock_main -lgmock -lgtest -lpthread -o validate_install_test
```

3. Run the test executable:

```sh
./validate_install_test
```

4. Expected output:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from ValidateInstallTest
[ RUN      ] ValidateInstallTest.Basic
[       OK ] ValidateInstallTest.Basic (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from ValidateInstallTest

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

<Tip>
If the above test passes without errors, your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation is working correctly.
Ensure that you linked against both `gmock_main` and `gmock`, which link to GoogleTest.
</Tip>

## 3. Run Existing GoogleMock Self-Tests

GoogleMock ships with its own test suite. Running these tests in your environment further assures you that the mocking framework functions correctly.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to your GoogleMock source directory.
2. Build the tests (using CMake):

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

3. Run GoogleMock tests:

```sh
ctest  # or 'make test'
```

4. Look for all tests to pass. For example, test names like `gmock-matchers-arithmetic_test` or `gmock-nice-strict_test` should complete without failures.

<Note>
By default, the GoogleMock tests are not built. To build them, make sure to run CMake with the option `-Dgmock_build_tests=ON` set.
Example:

```sh
cmake -Dgmock_build_tests=ON ..
```
</Note>

## 4. Common Verification Points

- **Compile-time verification:** Ensure that the compiler finds the GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and libraries without unresolved references.
- **Run-time verification:** Tests should run and complete successfully without errors or warnings related to missing expectations or linkage.
- **Mock behavior:** If you write a simple mock class and test it with `EXPECT_CALL`, the expectations should be enforced.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- If the compiler complains about missing headers, confirm your include path is correctly set.
- Linking errors often signal missing libraries (`-lgmock_main`, `-lgmock`, or `-lgtest`), wrong library order, or missing `-lpthread`.
- If tests fail unexpectedly, enable verbose output by running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed diagnostics.
- Ensure CMake or your build system is generating the correct targets and linking them properly.

See the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/common-setup-issues) page for more detailed fixes.

## 6. Next Steps

After validating your installation:

- Begin writing your own tests, see: [Writing Your First Test](../getting-started/first-test-workflow/writing-your-first-test)
- Learn how to add mocks: [Introducing GoogleMock: First Mock Test](../getting-started/first-test-workflow/basic-mocking-intro)
- Explore expectation setting and matchers from:
  - [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md)
  - [Matchers Reference](../docs/reference/matchers.md)
