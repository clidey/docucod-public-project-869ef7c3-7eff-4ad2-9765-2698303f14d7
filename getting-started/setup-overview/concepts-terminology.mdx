# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide on the core concepts and terminology of GoogleTest. Whether you are just starting or seeking to solidify your understanding, this page will equip you with the essential vocabulary and ideas to confidently read, write, and reason about tests using GoogleTest.

## Understanding GoogleTest Terminology

GoogleTest provides a structured yet flexible framework for writing tests in C++. To grasp it fully, familiarize yourself with the following main concepts:

- **Test Case / Test Suite**: A logical grouping of related tests. These groupings help organize tests into manageable units.

- **Test**: An individual test function that verifies a specific behavior or functionality.

- **Assertions**: Statements used within tests to verify expected conditions. Assertions express the expected outcome and can abort the test or just flag a failure.

- **Test Fixtures**: Classes that allow you to write a series of tests which share the same common setup and teardown code, avoiding repetition.

- **Parameterized Tests**: Tests that run the same logic with multiple input values.

- **Mock Objects**: Special test doubles created via GoogleMock, used to simulate and verify interactions with dependencies.

Understanding these terms is critical as they form the building blocks of your testing workflow.


## Test Cases and Tests

A **Test Case** (often called Test Suite) wraps multiple related tests, grouping them under a common name. Each **Test** implements a specific verification scenario:

```cpp
TEST(TestCaseName, TestName) {
  // Test logic here
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);  // Sample assertion
}
```

If your tests require shared resources or preparation, consider using test fixtures.


## Test Fixtures: Reuse Setup and Cleanup Code

Test fixtures let you define a class that all your tests inherit from, where you place common setup and teardown routines:

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup code
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup code
  }
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test1) {
  // Test code here
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test2) {
  // Another test using fixture
}
```

Use `TEST_F` macro for tests leveraging fixtures.


## Assertions: Validating Expected Conditions

Assertions lie at the heart of tests. GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions to
check conditions, for example:

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`: Checks if two values are equal; test continues if it fails.
- `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`: Fails the test immediately if `condition` is false.
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`: Checks that two values are not equal.

Choose assertion types based on whether you want to continue running the test after a failure.


## Parameterized Testing

To efficiently test code against multiple input values without duplication, use parameterized tests:

```cpp
class ParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(ParamTest, WorksWithVariousValues) {
  int input = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(input, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyTests, ParamTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This runs `WorksWithVariousValues` test three times with values `1`, `2`, and `3`.


## Mock Objects: Simulating and Verifying Interactions

Using GoogleMock (integrated with GoogleTest), **mock objects** let you simulate dependencies to isolate the unit under test and verify its interactions.

### Defining a Mock

You define a mock class by inheriting from the interface and using macros to specify mocked methods:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual bool AddItem(int item) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, AddItem, (int item), (override));
};
```

### Mock Behavior: ON_CALL and EXPECT_CALL

- `ON_CALL` sets default behavior when a mock method is called but doesn't require the call.
- `EXPECT_CALL` both sets expected behavior and requires that the method be called with specified parameters.

Example:

```cpp
MockFoo mock;
ON_CALL(mock, GetSize()).WillByDefault(::testing::Return(3));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, AddItem(::testing::_)).Times(2);

mock.AddItem(10);
mock.AddItem(20);
```

### Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

By default, mocks warn on calls to methods without expectations (`NaggyMock`). You can suppress warnings using `NiceMock` or make any unexpected call a failure using `StrictMock`:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
```

### Cardinalities: Controlling How Many Times Methods are Called

With `EXPECT_CALL`, specify how many times a mocked method is expected to be called:

- `.Times(AnyNumber())`: any number of calls allowed.
- `.Times(Exactly(n))` or `.Times(n)`: exactly `n` calls.
- `.Times(AtLeast(n))`, `.Times(AtMost(n))`, `.Times(Between(m, n))`: flexible bounds.


## Using Matchers to Specify Argument Expectations

GoogleMock matchers let you specify argument patterns:

- `_` matches any argument.
- `Eq(value)`, `Ne(value)`, `Ge(value)`, `Le(value)`, etc.

You can combine, compose, and write custom matchers, enabling precise argument validation.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, AddItem(::testing::Ge(10))).Times(3);
```


## Summary

By mastering these core concepts — test cases and tests, assertions, fixtures, parameterized tests, and mocks — you position yourself to use GoogleTest effectively. With a solid vocabulary and understanding, reading and writing robust, maintainable tests becomes straightforward and productive.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use fixtures to reduce test duplication.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior and `EXPECT_CALL` only to enforce expectations.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warning noise during early test development.
- Specify clear cardinalities to catch unexpected call counts.
- Leverage parameterized tests for coverage with minimal code.
- Understand matcher capabilities to write expressive expectations.


## Next Steps

- Explore writing your first test case using `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros.
- Learn about GoogleMock basics to create and use mocks.
- Dive into parameterized tests for advanced coverage.
- Consult the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for detailed recipes.
