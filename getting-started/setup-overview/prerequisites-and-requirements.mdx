# System Requirements & Prerequisites

This page details the **platforms, compilers, C++ standards, and dependencies** necessary to build and use GoogleTest (and GoogleMock). Ensuring your system meets these requirements is essential before proceeding with installation and usage.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a broad range of operating systems, compilers, and toolchains, consistent with Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. This wide compatibility enables flexible development environments.

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Linux (various distributions)
  - Windows (including Visual Studio toolchains)
  - macOS

- **Compilers:**
  - GCC (with adequate standards support)
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
  - Other industry-standard C++ compilers supporting C++17

<Tip>
Ensure your platform's compiler fully supports **C++17** standard or later, as GoogleTest requires it to build and function correctly.
</Tip>

---

## 2. C++ Standard and Compiler Settings

- GoogleTest requires an environment supporting **C++17** or newer.
  - Set the compiler flag to enforce C++17. For example, in CMake you can add:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If your project is in pure C with GoogleTest usage for validation, pass the flag through `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` as needed.

- For Visual Studio users, be aware of runtime linkage differences:
  - By default, GoogleTest links the C runtimes statically.
  - If your project uses dynamic runtimes, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to align with your setup (see [Installing GoogleTest](../getting-started/setup-overview/installation) for details).

---

## 3. Dependencies and Software Prerequisites

- **CMake version 3.13 or later** is required for building GoogleTest and GoogleMock efficiently.
- For certain features and multithreaded test support, the **POSIX pthread library** is frequently utilized.
  - You can explicitly force pthread availability with compiler flags:`-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`.
- On Windows, Visual Studio or similar environment setup is necessary to build from CMake generated projects.

---

## 4. Platform-specific Notes

### Linux and macOS

- Ensure you have developer tools installed (`gcc`/`clang`, `make`, `cmake`).
- To build:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
  cd googletest
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install
  ```

- Check that `make` and `cmake` commands succeed without errors.

### Windows

- Install Visual Studio with C++ development tools.
- Run CMake GUI or command line to generate Visual Studio project files.
- Open generated `.sln` file, build GoogleTest and GoogleMock targets.

<Tip>
On Windows, mismatched runtime linkage can cause linker errors. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to resolve them by enabling dynamic CRT linkage for GoogleTest:

```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```

</Tip>

---

## 5. Access Requirements

- Ensure you have **read access** to the GoogleTest repository (public).
- For installation, **administrator or root privileges** may be necessary if installing system-wide (e.g., using `sudo make install`).

---

## 6. Network and Connectivity

- A stable internet connection is required to clone the repository.
- If your build scripts download GoogleTest automatically (e.g., using CMake `FetchContent`), allow network access during configuration.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Compiler Support:** Some older compilers may claim C++17 support but miss necessary features. Verify with your compiler documentation.
- **Build Errors:** If you encounter errors related to missing pthread or threading libraries, ensure your development environment has the required POSIX thread support.
- **Multiple Compiler Versions:** Conflicts can arise if your environment has multiple compilers installed. Explicitly specify the compiler to CMake when needed, e.g., `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++`.

---

## 8. Summary

Before building or using GoogleTest, confirm that:

- Your operating system and compiler support C++17.
- You have CMake 3.13+ installed.
- Multithread support (pthreads) is available or configured.
- Your Visual Studio projects align runtimes or adjust using `gtest_force_shared_crt`.
- Administrative permissions are in place if performing system-wide installs.

Following these prerequisites ensures a smooth setup experience.

## Next Steps

After confirming system readiness, proceed to the [Installing GoogleTest](../getting-started/setup-overview/installation) page to learn how to fetch, build, and install the framework.
