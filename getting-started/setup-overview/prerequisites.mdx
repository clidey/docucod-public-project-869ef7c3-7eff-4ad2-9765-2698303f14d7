# Prerequisites and Supported Platforms

This page helps you ensure your development environment is ready for using GoogleTest, covering the minimum required C++ standard, supported compilers and operating systems, and recommended tools for effectively working with GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires your compiler to support **at least the C++17 standard**. This modern standard brings needed language features that GoogleTest depends on to build and run correctly.

**Key actions:**

- Verify your compiler and build system are configured to use C++17.
- In CMake, specify the C++ standard with:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If not using CMake, ensure your compiler flags include the appropriate C++17 setting (`-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang, `/std:c++17` for MSVC).

<Tip>
Using a standard version earlier than C++17 will prevent GoogleTest from building and cause compilation errors.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Supported Compilers and Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and supports a broad range of environments.

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux**: Most modern distributions with GCC or Clang
- **Windows**: Microsoft Visual Studio with MSVC compiler
- **macOS**: Xcode with Clang compiler

### Supported Compilers

- GCC
- Clang/LLVM
- MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)

Make sure you are using a compiler version that fully supports C++17 features.

<Warning>
Older compilers or non-standard-compliant versions may cause unexpected build failures or runtime issues.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Recommended Tools and Dependencies

To build and use GoogleTest effectively, the following tools and dependencies are recommended:

- **CMake**: 
  - GoogleTest provides native CMake build scripts which ease building on multiple platforms.
  - Download from <https://cmake.org/> if not already installed.

- **Build systems:**
  - Make (on Unix-like systems)
  - Visual Studio project files (on Windows)

- **Git**: For obtaining the GoogleTest source (optional if you download ZIP releases)

- **Thread support:**
  - GoogleTest uses pthreads on platforms that support it.
  - If detection issues arise, use compiler flags like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`.

- **Shared vs static libs:**
  - By default, GoogleTest builds static libraries.
  - To build shared libraries on some platforms, you may need to add `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` compiler flag.

---

## 4. Environment Preparation Checklist

<Check>
- **C++17 support enabled in your build system and compiler**
- **Have CMake (3.14 or newer) installed if using CMake**
- **Use supported compilers: GCC, Clang, MSVC**
- **Ensure pthread library available or explicitly disable via definitions**
- **For Windows MSVC users, consider `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake if runtime mismatch errors occur**
- **Avoid mixing release/debug runtime libraries between GoogleTest and your project**
</Check>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Platforms and Compilers">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors Due to C++ Standard">
Ensure the C++17 standard is specified both for GoogleTest and your project. Missing this often results in errors on features like `std::variant` or structured bindings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows Runtime Libraries">
If you encounter linker errors such as `mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'`, enable the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

This makes runtime linkage consistent between GoogleTest and your project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthreads on Linux/macOS">
Verify that pthreads are available and linked. If CMake's automatic detection fails, explicitly define:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

and add linking flags for pthreads, e.g., `-lpthread`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Additional Notes

- GoogleTest works both as a standalone test framework and as part of other build systems.
- Windows users can build GoogleTest using Visual Studio solutions generated by CMake.
- Mac and Linux users usually use generated Makefiles and GNU toolchains.

<Note>
Before building or using GoogleTest, make sure your environment satisfies the compatibility and prerequisite requirements listed on this page.

## 8. Sample CMake Configuration Snippet

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add GoogleTest as a subdirectory or find_package if installed
# add_subdirectory(googletest)

# Your executable
add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)

# Link against GoogleTest
# target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)
```
