# Prerequisites for Using GoogleTest

This page outlines the essential software, environment, and system requirements you must have before installing, building, and running GoogleTest. Ensuring your setup meets these prerequisites will eliminate surprises and facilitate a smooth onboarding experience.

---

## 1. System Requirements

Before diving into GoogleTest installation or use, verify the following minimum system capabilities:

- **Operating System:**
  - Supported platforms include Linux, Windows, and macOS.
  - Specific platform notes and exceptions are covered in the [Platform-specific Notes](../installation/platform-specific-notes.md) page.

- **Hardware:**
  - A system with at least 2 GB of RAM and sufficient disk space to build and run C++ projects.
  - Standard processor compatible with your operating system.

## 2. Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler that supports the C++17 standard or later, as the framework utilizes language features introduced in C++17.

- **Supported Compilers:**
  - GCC 7.0 or higher
  - Clang 6.0 or higher
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or newer (MSVC with C++17 support)
  
- **Compiler Configuration:**
  - You must enable at least C++17 standard support explicitly in your build system.
  - For example, with CMake, specify:

    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```

- **Threading Support:**
  - GoogleTest is thread-safe when used with the pthread library or equivalent.
  - On POSIX-compliant systems, pthread support is typically required to avoid linkage errors.
  - On Windows, threading is handled differently; refer to platform notes.

## 3. Build Tools and Dependency Software

To build GoogleTest and integrate it into your projects, you must have appropriate build tools installed.

- **CMake:**
  - Version 3.13 or higher is required.
  - CMake generates build scripts for your native build system.
  - You can download it from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).

- **Build Systems Supported:**
  - Make (GNU Make) or Ninja on Linux/macOS.
  - MSBuild or Visual Studio solutions on Windows.

- **Optional:**
  - For users who prefer Bazel, ensure the Bazel build system is installed. See the installation guide specific to Bazel.


## 4. Required Access and Permissions

- Adequate permissions to install software on your machine.
- If installing GoogleTest system-wide (e.g., under `/usr/local/`), administrative or root access may be required.

## 5. Network Connectivity

- If retrieving GoogleTest source code via Git or downloading dependencies during build configuration, ensure your machine has internet access.
- Firewall or proxy settings should allow https://github.com connections.

## How to Verify Your Prerequisites

### Check Compiler Version

Run the following commands in your terminal to verify your compiler supports C++17:

```bash
# GCC
$ gcc --version
$ gcc -std=c++17 -o test test.cpp  # Should compile without errors

# Clang
$ clang --version
$ clang -std=c++17 -o test test.cpp

# MSVC
> cl
> cl /std:c++17 test.cpp
```

### Check CMake Version

```bash
$ cmake --version
```

Confirm that the output shows version 3.13 or above.

## Common Prerequisite Pitfalls and Troubleshooting Tips

- **Compiler too old:**
  - If your compiler does not support C++17, upgrade to a newer version before proceeding.

- **CMake version incompatible:**
  - Older CMake versions lack support for `FetchContent` and other modern features used by GoogleTest.
  - Upgrade CMake via your package manager or from the official website.

- **Missing pthreads or thread libraries:**
  - On Linux, ensure `pthread` development packages are installed (`libpthread` is often included by default).
  - If you encounter linker errors related to threading, verify compiler and linker flags.

- **Insufficient permissions for installation:**
  - Use `sudo` or run your terminal as Administrator if system-wide installation steps fail.

- **Network blocks GitHub:**
  - Use a VPN or adjust firewall rules if `git clone` or `FetchContent` fails during configuration.
