# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock

Ensure your development environment meets these prerequisites before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide covers compiler versions, required tools, supported language standards, and platforms for a smooth setup experience.

---

## 1. Supported Compiler Versions

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler. Ensure your compiler matches or exceeds the following minimum versions:

- **GCC:** 7.0 or later
- **Clang:** 5.0 or later
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 or later
- **Intel C++ Compiler:** Compatible with C++17 support

<Check>
If your compiler does not fully support C++17, GoogleTest will fail to build with an error on unsupported versions.
</Check>

## 2. Language Standard Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require building with the C++17 standard or later. When using CMake:

- Specify the C++ standard in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If you must override compiler flags directly, pass them using:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=c++17'
```

<Note>
GoogleTest cannot be built or run on projects that do not support at least C++17.
</Note>

## 3. Required Tools and Build Systems

To build and install GoogleTest and GoogleMock, ensure you have the following tools installed:

| Tool        | Description                                   | Minimum Version / Notes                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Git         | Cloning the source code                        | Latest stable version recommended                         |
| CMake       | For generating build scripts and projects     | Version 3.14 or later is required for FetchContent support |
| Make / Ninja / Visual Studio | Build tools for compilation            | Depends on your platform (Make for **nix, Visual Studio for Windows) |

<Info>
- CMake can build GoogleTest either as a standalone project or incorporated into your own project.
- Bazel is also supported but covered in a different guide.
</Info>

## 4. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of platforms, including but not limited to:

- Windows (Desktop editions with Visual Studio, MinGW)
- Linux distributions
- macOS (with Xcode)
- Embedded platforms with limitations (ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52, Arduino)

<Warning>
Some embedded platforms (e.g., ESP8266) may have partial support with specific entry point conventions (using setup/loop instead of main).
</Warning>

## 5. Threading and Runtime Libraries

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms that support pthreads.
- On Windows, it uses native threading primitives.

When building on MSVC, be mindful of runtime library linkage:

- By default, GoogleTest links the C runtime statically, which might cause conflicts if your project links dynamically.
- Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to force dynamic linkage of runtimes and avoid linker conflicts.

## 6. Optional Compiler Flags and Tweaks

Customize GoogleTest behavior by passing compiler macros:

- Enable or disable pthread support:

  ```
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1    # force enable
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0    # force disable
  ```

- Build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows):

  ```
  -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1  # when linking against shared gtest
  ```

- Avoid macro name clashes for GoogleTest macros like `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ` by:

  ```
  -DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
  ```

  This renames macros (for example, `TEST` becomes `GTEST_TEST`).

## 7. Summary of Minimum Environment

| Component          | Requirement / Version               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Compiler           | C++17 compliant (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 15.3+) |
| Build system       | CMake 3.14+                      |
| Platform           | Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Embedded (limited) |
| Threading          | pthreads support recommended      |

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- Confirm your compiler version with:
  ```bash
  g++ --version
  clang++ --version
  cl.exe (Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt)
  ```

- If you encounter linker errors related to the C runtime on Windows, verify the runtime linkage and use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option if necessary.

- Ensure CMake meets the minimum version, especially if using FetchContent to pull GoogleTest source in your build.

- For embedded platforms, check GoogleTest's platform-specific entry points and features like stream redirection and death tests which may be limited.

- Review build logs carefully to detect any missing dependencies or incompatible flags.

## Further Reading and Next Steps

- After confirming your environment, proceed to the [Installing with CMake](getting-started/installation-and-configuration/install-cmake) guide for build instructions.

- For Bazel users, see [Installing with Bazel](getting-started/installation-and-configuration/install-bazel).

- Understand core concepts and terminology to effectively write tests in [Core Concepts & Terminology](overview/core-concepts-and-architecture/core-terminology).
