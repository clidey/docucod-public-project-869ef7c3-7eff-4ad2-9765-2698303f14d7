# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Prepare your development environment for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock by ensuring your system and tools meet the necessary requirements. This page guides you through the supported operating systems, compilers, build tools, and C++ standard requirements so you can set up smoothly and avoid common compatibility pitfalls.

---

## 1. System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems
GoogleTest is designed for portability and supports a wide range of operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (including desktop versions and MinGW)
- **macOS** (including Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Other Unix-like OSes supported implicitly via POSIX compliance

While GoogleTest can be compiled on many platforms, official support centers on these mainstream systems where comprehensive testing and compatibility are ensured.

### Compiler Support

GoogleTest requires a **C++ compiler with C++17 support** as a minimum. Supported compilers include:

- **GCC 7.0 or newer**
- **Clang 5.0 or newer**
- **MSVC 2017 Update 3 or newer**
- **Intel compiler variants with compatible C++17 support**

To verify your compiler version, use:

```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version

# Clang example
clang --version

# MSVC example
cl  # run from Developer Command Prompt
```

GoogleTest leverages modern C++17 features to provide its rich API, so older compilers will fail to build.

### Build Tools

- **CMake 3.14 or later** is recommended for configuration and building. GoogleTest's build scripts leverage CMake's FetchContent and modern capabilities.
- **Make, Ninja, MSBuild** or native IDE tools can be used to perform the build after configuration.

Ensure your build toolchain matches these requirements to avoid build failures.

## 2. Environment and Dependency Setup

### Essential Dependencies

GoogleTest itself has minimal external dependencies. However, some features depend on system capabilities:

- **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**: On Unix-like systems, pthread support enables multithreading features and thread-safe tests.
- On Windows, native threading APIs are used.

If your platform lacks pthreads, GoogleTest disables threading features accordingly.

### Environment Variables & Paths

Make sure your compiler and build tools are available on your system `PATH`. For example, add CMake and your chosen compiler binaries directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

For package managers, ensure that the pkg-config search path is set appropriately if you build or install GoogleTest into custom locations.

## 3. Supported Platforms Summary

GoogleTest's compatibility is summarized as:

| Platform          | C++ Standard | Compilers Supported                     | Build Tools               |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Linux             | C++17        | GCC 7+, Clang 5+                      | CMake 3.14+, Make, Ninja  |
| macOS (Intel & ARM) | C++17      | AppleClang (Xcode), GCC, Clang        | CMake 3.14+, Xcode, Ninja |
| Windows Desktop   | C++17        | MSVC 2017 Update 3+, MinGW GCC 7+, Clang | CMake 3.14+, MSBuild, Ninja |

<Info>
Refer to the [GoogleTest Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the [Detailed Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for the most up-to-date supported versions.

## 4. Minimum C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires your project to compile with **C++17** features enabled. This ensures access to the modern language constructs it uses.

If your build system does not already target C++17, set the appropriate compiler flags:

### GCC and Clang
```bash
-std=c++17
```

### MSVC
Set the project language standard to **ISO C++17 Standard (`/std:c++17`)** in your Visual Studio project properties.

<Tip>
Using C++17 enables GoogleTest to provide cleaner, safer, and more efficient test code including improved assertion macros and richer type support.
</Tip>

## 5. Configuring Your Environment for Smooth Setup

The following steps ensure your environment is ready:

### Step 1: Verify Operating System Compatibility

Confirm your OS matches supported platforms: Linux, Windows, or macOS.

### Step 2: Install or Update Your Compiler

Ensure your compiler is capable of targeting C++17. Update to the latest stable version if necessary.

### Step 3: Install CMake

Download and install CMake 3.14 or newer from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Make sure that paths to your compiler and CMake executables are in your system `PATH`.

### Step 5: Check Threading Support (Optional)

For Unix-like systems, confirm that pthread development headers are installed (e.g., `libpthread-devel` on RPM-based distros).

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Platform Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Too Old or Not Found">
If you encounter errors about unsupported compiler features or C++17 errors, verify:

- Your compiler version supports C++17.
- Your build scripts include the correct `-std=c++17` or `/std:c++17` flag.
- Your compiler is accessible in the system `PATH`.

For older systems, upgrade or use a containerized build environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Tool Version Incompatibility">
Ensure your CMake version is 3.14 or newer by running:

```bash
cmake --version
```

If outdated, download the latest release or use a package manager.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Threading Support">
On some platforms, you may see warnings about pthreads or threading features being disabled.

Check that pthread development libraries are installed, e.g.: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install glibc-headers glibc-devel     # RHEL/CentOS
```

If pthreads are not available/desired, GoogleTest will disable multithreading by default.

## Summary

Ensuring you meet GoogleTest's prerequisites drastically reduces setup friction. Confirm your hardware supports the target OS, your compiler fully supports C++17, and your build tools are modern and correctly configured. This guarantees a robust foundation for building, running, and maintaining tests effectively across platforms.

<Check>
For the smoothest experience:
- Use a supported OS: Linux, Windows Desktop, or macOS.
- Use GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or MSVC 2017+ with C++17 enabled.
- Use CMake 3.14 or newer for configuration.
- Verify pthread support on Unix-like systems if using multithreading.
</Check>
