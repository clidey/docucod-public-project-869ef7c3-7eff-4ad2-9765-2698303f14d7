# System Requirements

GoogleTest is designed to support modern C++ testing across a broad range of development environments. Before installing and integrating GoogleTest into your projects, it is crucial to verify that your system meets the necessary platform, compiler, and build tool requirements. This page helps you assess compatibility and prepare your environment for a seamless experience.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports multiple operating systems and platforms, aligned with Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. The framework reliably runs on:

- **Desktop Platforms:** Linux distributions, Windows Desktop (including MinGW), and macOS
- **POSIX-Compliant Systems:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX
- **Mobile and Embedded Platforms:** iOS, Windows Mobile, Android (support varies by API level)

> For detailed support information and the latest platform matrix, visit the official support matrix at [Google's OSS Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Key Notes

- GoogleTest **does not officially support some less common platforms**, such as Fuchsia and Haiku, without potential instability.
- If you operate on Windows, both native builds (Visual Studio) and MinGW environments are supported.
- Some embedded or mobile OS versions may lack full support for features like file systems or threading.

---

## 2. Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a build environment supporting the **C++17 standard** or later. This ensures usage of modern language features, compiler optimizations, and compatibility.

### Minimum C++ Standard

- **C++17**: GoogleTest mandates at least C++17 compliance for all compilation. Attempting to build with earlier versions will cause errors.

### Supported Compilers

- **GCC:** GCC 8 and higher versions are recommended
- **Clang:** Clang 7 and higher
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later

Other compilers may work if they fully support C++17, but GoogleTest's behavior on them is not guaranteed.

### Compiler Features

- Exception support should be enabled, though GoogleTest can be built with exceptions disabled if needed.
- RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) support is expected for some GoogleTest features.
- Pthread or Windows threading libraries must be available to support multi-threaded tests.

> To enforce C++17 in CMake projects, add:
>
> ```cmake
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
> ```

---

## 3. Build Tools Compatibility

GoogleTest offers flexible build options compatible with popular build systems:

- **CMake:** Primary and recommended build tool
  - Requires CMake version 3.13 or higher (FetchContent features require 3.14+)
  - Supports building GoogleTest standalone or embedded into your projects
- **Bazel:** Official build configurations and rules are provided
- **Makefiles and Other Build Systems:** Possible but requires manual setup

### Additional Tool Requirements

- **Threading libraries:** On POSIX systems, pthread must be available; on Windows, native threading is used.
- **Linker Support:** Ability to link static or shared libraries as needed

> Consult the [Integration with Build and CI Systems](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/overview/integration-adoption/integration-workflow.mdx) for detailed guidance on build tool integration.

---

## 4. Environment and Network Requirements

- Network access may be required if using CMake's `FetchContent` to download GoogleTest automatically during configuration.
- Firewall and proxy settings should allow HTTPS access to `github.com` for source retrieval.

## 5. Summary of Key Requirements

| Category              | Requirement                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating Systems     | Linux, Windows (Desktop, MinGW), macOS, POSIX variants    |
| C++ Standard          | Minimum C++17 compliant compiler                           |
| Compilers             | GCC ≥ 8, Clang ≥ 7, MSVC ≥ 19.11 (VS 2017 Update 3)       |
| Build Tools           | CMake ≥ 3.13 (recommended), Bazel, Make (manual)          |
| Threading Support     | pthread on POSIX, Windows threads                          |
| Network               | HTTPS access to github.com (for CMake downloads)           |

## 6. Verification Before Installation

To confirm your system meets these requirements, perform the following:

1. **Check Operating System and Version:** Ensure your OS is in the supported list.
2. **Check Compiler Version:**

    - For GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc --version
    ```
    Expected: 8 or newer.

    - For Clang:
    ```bash
    clang --version
    ```
    Expected: 7 or newer.

    - For MSVC, verify Visual Studio version or run:
    ```powershell
    cl.exe
    ```
    Expected: Version 19.11 or newer.

3. **Check C++ Support:**

    Compile a simple C++ file with `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

4. **Check Build Tools:**

    - CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake --version
    ```
    Expected: 3.13 or newer.

5. **Threading Support:** Confirm that `pthread` is installed on POSIX systems.
    ```bash
    ldconfig -p | grep pthread
    ```

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Too Old or Missing C++17 Support">
Ensure you are using a compiler version that supports C++17. Upgrade your compiler or install a supported version. For legacy systems, consider a newer OS or containerized build environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake Version Is Outdated">
Upgrade CMake to at least version 3.13. Some GoogleTest build options require 3.14 or later.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread or Threading Library">
On Linux and macOS, `pthread` is required. Install `libpthread` or equivalent packages. With custom build systems, ensure to link with `-pthread`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Windows Runtime Mismatch in Visual Studio">
If you encounter runtime linking errors due to different runtimes (static vs dynamic), use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to unify CRT linkage.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
