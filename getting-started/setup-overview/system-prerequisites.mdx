# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following system, compiler, language, and tooling requirements before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Meeting these prerequisites guarantees a smooth build and testing experience.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed for cross-platform compatibility. It supports the following platforms:

- Linux distributions
- macOS (Mac OS X)
- Windows (including Desktop and MinGW environments)

> For an up-to-date list of compilers, operating systems, and build tools supported, refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) matrix.


## 2. Compiler Support and C++ Language Standard

- **Minimum required C++ standard**: C++17
  - GoogleTest version 1.17.x and later require a compiler supporting at least C++17 features.
- Compatible compilers include, but are not limited to:
  - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual Studio (2017 Update 3 and later)
  - Other compilers conforming to C++17 or above

❗ Ensure your build environment explicitly enables C++17 support, as GoogleTest will not compile successfully without it.


## 3. Tooling Dependencies

The primary build tooling revolves around CMake, which simplifies cross-platform builds.

- **CMake version**: 3.14 or later is required, particularly to support the FetchContent module used for dependency management.
- **Build tools (generators)**:
  - On Unix-based systems: Make, Ninja, or others compatible with CMake
  - On Windows: Visual Studio


## 4. Optional Dependencies

- **Abseil (coming soon)**: GoogleTest plans to depend on Abseil for certain internal utilities. While this dependency is not required immediately, staying updated on GoogleTest releases is recommended.


## 5. Environment Configuration Requirements

- Ensure that environment variables and system permissions allow for filesystem operations needed during builds and test executions.
- Network access may be required for CMake to download GoogleTest source if using the FetchContent method.


## 6. Best Practices

- Verify compiler C++ standard settings by adding `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED=ON` in your CMake configuration.
- Use recent versions of your compiler and build tools to avoid compatibility issues.
- Review your platform's support for threading libraries such as pthread if planning multi-threaded tests.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">  
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">  
Make sure your compiler version supports C++17 and that your build system enables this standard explicitly. For example, in CMake use:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Upgrade or switch your compiler if your current version does not meet this requirement.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="CMake Version Too Old">  
Check your installed CMake version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

Download and install CMake 3.14 or newer from [https://cmake.org/install](https://cmake.org/install) if required.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Missing Build Tools">  
Verify that necessary build tools like Make, Ninja, or Visual Studio are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
On Linux/macOS:

```bash
make --version
```

On Windows, ensure that Visual Studio or appropriate build environments are installed.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Network Access Issues with FetchContent">  
If your build setup uses CMake’s FetchContent to download GoogleTest, ensure your machine has internet access. Otherwise, consider manually downloading and embedding GoogleTest in your project.
</Accordion>
