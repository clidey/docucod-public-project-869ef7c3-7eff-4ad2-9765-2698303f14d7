# Introduction & Prerequisites

Welcome to GoogleTest and GoogleMock, a unified C++ testing and mocking framework designed to help you write reliable and maintainable tests for your code. This guide introduces the core value of these tools, their primary use cases, and the essential prerequisites you need to start writing and running your first test.

---

## 1. Understanding the Value of GoogleTest and GoogleMock

GoogleTest and GoogleMock empower C++ developers to deliver high-quality software with confidence by enabling:

- **Automated test discovery and execution:** No manual enumeration of tests needed.
- **Rich and flexible assertions:** Verify program behavior clearly and thoroughly.
- **Test fixtures and parameterized tests:** Simplify setup and broaden test coverage.
- **Integrated mocking framework:** Easily create and manage mock objects for dependency injection and interface testing.

These features dramatically enhance test maintainability, speed up debugging, and support complex testing scenarios including unit, integration, and regression testing.

---

## 2. Primary Use Cases

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are ideal for developers aiming to:

- **Unit test complex logic** in isolated components.
- **Mock interfaces and dependencies** to simulate interactions without requiring the entire system.
- **Verify call sequences, argument expectations, and side effects** using expressive, readable syntax.
- **Boost productivity through automated feedback** that catches failures as they happen.

By using these tools, developers reduce brittle tests and external dependencies, make tests fast and reliable, and gain granular control over interaction verification.

---

## 3. Supported Platforms and Minimum Requirements

### Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of platforms and compilers, including but not limited to:

- Linux distributions
- Windows (including Visual Studio environments)
- macOS

### Compiler Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting **at least C++17** is required.
- Commonly used compilers supported include GCC, Clang, and MSVC.

### Build System Integration

- Compatible with CMake (version 3.14 or higher recommended), Bazel, and other build tools.
- Easily included via `find_package` or as subprojects.

### Thread Safety

- Thread-safe when compiled with pthread support.
- On platforms without pthreads, avoid concurrent GoogleTest assertion calls from multiple threads.

### Optional Dependencies

- GoogleMock is bundled with GoogleTest and activated by default.
- For custom setups, you can disable GoogleMock if you only want testing functionality.

## 4. Getting Ready: Checklist Before You Begin

1. **Install a C++17-compatible compiler** on your development workstation.
2. **Choose your build system:** CMake is recommended.
3. **Get the GoogleTest source code:** Clone the official repository or download a release.
4. **Confirm network access** if using CMake to fetch GoogleTest automatically.
5. **Have a basic familiarity with C++ development**—understanding compilation and linking.

## 5. Quick Start Example

To illustrate the core value immediately, here is a minimal example showing how GoogleTest and GoogleMock improve testing:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

using ::testing::AtLeast;

TEST(PaintTest, CallsPenDown) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(AtLeast(1));

  // Exercise code that uses turtle
  turtle.PenDown();  // Test will pass if PenDown is called at least once
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This example shows how GoogleMock makes it natural to verify that code under test calls the expected methods correctly.

## 6. Tips and Best Practices

- **Use GoogleMock for interface-heavy code:** It is invaluable for isolating dependencies.
- **Set expectations *before* exercising the mock:** gMock expects expectations to be declared upfront.
- **Avoid mocking classes you don’t own:** Prefer adaptor interfaces under your control to safeguard against breaking changes.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions in tests:** They report multiple failures without aborting early.
- **Leverage test fixtures (`TEST_F`) for shared setup:** This keeps related tests concise and maintainable.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Forgetting to call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` causes unexpected test behavior.
- Using `EXPECT_CALL` after calling the mock method leads to undefined behavior.
- Over-specifying argument matching may make tests brittle and hard to maintain.
- Not returning appropriate values from mocked methods can lead to test failures or crashes.
