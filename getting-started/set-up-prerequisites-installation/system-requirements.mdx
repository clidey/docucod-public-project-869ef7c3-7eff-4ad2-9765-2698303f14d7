# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

This page provides a detailed overview of the environment prerequisites you must meet to build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock successfully. It covers the minimum C++ standard version, supported compilers, operating systems, and development tools. It also offers compatibility notes and helpful guidance to confirm your platform meets these requirements before proceeding.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

- **Minimum Required C++ Standard:** C++17

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports C++17. The codebase enforces this by checking the version of the compiler’s C++ language support during compilation. If your compiler does not support C++17 or higher, the build will fail.

**How to confirm:**

- In your build system, ensure the C++ standard is explicitly set to C++17 or later. For example, with CMake, add:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```
- Alternatively, add appropriate compiler flags manually, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang.

**Why this matters:**

GoogleTest uses C++17 features and assumes their presence. Attempting to build with an older standard will result in errors and unsupported behavior.

---

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest supports the following compilers, tested and verified to work well:

- **GCC:** Version 7.0 or later
- **Clang:** Versions supporting C++17 (usually 4.x and later)
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC):** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later. Note that MSVC versions prior to 2015 are not supported.
- **Intel C++ Compiler:** Compatible with GCC flags and versions supporting C++17
- **Other compilers:** Support might vary and is not officially guaranteed. If you use less common compilers, you may need to customize GoogleTest’s macro definitions or build flags.

**Compiler feature checks:**

- Exception handling and RTTI are assumed to be enabled for normal operation. GoogleTest automatically detects and configures these features.
- Thread safety depends on compiler and platform support for threading primitives.

**Tips:**

- On MSVC, consider the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if you need to link runtimes dynamically.
- If your environment disables exceptions or RTTI, check GoogleTest macros like `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` and `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`.

## 3. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest is designed for maximum portability and supports a wide range of platforms:

| Platform                 | Availability                                         | Notes                                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux                    | Fully supported                                     | Includes most distributions and Google Android         |
| Mac OS X (macOS)         | Fully supported                                     | Includes iOS (with some feature limitations)            |
| Windows                  | Fully supported                                     | Both Desktop and MinGW environments supported          |
| FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD | Supported                                          | Community support may vary                               |
| Solaris, AIX, HP-UX      | Supported                                          | Enterprise UNIX variants, less stable in some cases     |
| Other Unix-like OSes     | Partial support                                    | May require manual configuration                        |

**Special notes:**

- Android support requires specific NDK versions due to POSIX feature availability.
- Some mobile and embedded platforms, e.g., Windows Mobile, ESP8266, QuRT, have limited or no support for features like stream redirection and threading.
- Death tests and other advanced features require a file system, limiting their availability on embedded platforms.

---

## 4. Threading and Feature Support

- **Thread Safety:** GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthreads or equivalent threading primitives.

- **Pthreads Availability:** Auto-detected on most Unix-like systems including Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and more. Can be forced via `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if detection fails.

- **Windows Threading:** Microsoft Windows native threading is supported, except certain mobile variants.

- **Exceptions:** Detected and enabled by default; you can override via compiler flags or macros.

- **RTTI:** Run-time type information support is required; dynamically detected but can be overridden.

- **Stream Redirection:** Supported on all desktop platforms except certain embedded or mobile-oriented OSes.

- **Death Tests:** Supported only on desktop platforms that have a file system and runtime process control.

---

## 5. Developer Tools and Build Environments

### Build Tools

GoogleTest supports multiple build tools and integration methods:

- **CMake:** Primary recommended build system.
  - Requires CMake 3.14 or later for seamless configuration.
- **Bazel:** Supported with official rules.
- **Pkg-config:** Available for some Unix-like environments to simplify compiling and linking.

### Linking Options

- Static libraries are the default and simplest.
- Shared libraries (DLLs on Windows) are supported. To build GoogleTest as a shared library, add the compile flag `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.
- When linking against the shared GoogleTest library, compile your tests with `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

### Runtime Library Linking (Visual Studio)

By default, GoogleTest links the C runtime statically while newer Visual Studio projects link dynamically. Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align this and avoid mismatch errors.

## 6. Compatibility Notes & Customization Macros

GoogleTest detects its environment and adapts using macros that can also be overridden:

- Environment detection includes OS platform, pthread support, exception handling, RTTI, file system, and thread safety.
- Common macros you may define yourself:
  - `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` to force pthread usage.
  - `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY` and `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` for shared library builds.
  - Exception and RTTI flags like `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` and `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`.
- For detailed macro control, refer to the file [gtest-port.h](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h).

<Tip>
If you encounter build or runtime incompatibilities, overriding these macros can help adapt GoogleTest to your specific environment.

## 7. Confirming Your Environment

Follow these steps to validate your system readiness:

1. **Check your compiler version:** Run `g++ --version`, `clang++ --version`, or check Visual Studio version.
2. **Confirm C++ standard support:** Compile a small test program with `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
3. **Validate pthread support:** On Unix, ensure `pthread` is installed and linkable.
4. **Check OS platform:** Ensure you’re on a supported OS or one compatible with GoogleTest features.
5. **Test for exceptions and RTTI:** Compile a minimal program using exceptions and RTTI or rely on GoogleTest's auto-detection.
6. **Verify your build system supports CMake or Bazel:** Gather the required versions.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Compatibility Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Build fails with C++ version errors">
Make sure your compiler supports C++17 and that your build system is set to it. See section 1 for details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors related to pthread">
Verify pthread development libraries are installed. If using CMake, confirm `find_package(Threads)` succeeds. Otherwise, add `-pthread` manually.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime errors on unsupported platforms">
Check that your platform is in the supported OS list. Embedded platforms may lack file system or thread support required by GoogleTest.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Visual Studio runtime library conflicts">
Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to unify runtime linkage types.
