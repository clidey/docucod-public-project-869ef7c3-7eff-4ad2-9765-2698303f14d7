# Prerequisites and System Requirements

This page explains the essential development tools, supported platforms, and minimum requirements you need to successfully use GoogleTest. Before diving into installation and test writing, ensure your environment is fully compatible.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is built to run on a wide variety of operating systems and compilers, enabling portable and consistent testing across environments. It supports all major desktop platforms:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW)
- **macOS**
- **Unix-like systems** (FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, etc.)

**Note:** GoogleTest has partial or experimental support on certain embedded and specialized platforms, but core development and testing focus on the above.

For detailed platform support, visit the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation.

---

## 2. Development Tools and Compiler Requirements

To build and use GoogleTest, your build environment must meet the following:

- **C++ Compiler**: Support for a compiler implementing at least the **C++17 standard** is mandatory.
  - Commonly used compilers include:
    - GCC 7.0 and above
    - Clang 5.0 and above
    - MSVC 2017 Update 3 (19.11) and above
- **Build Systems**: GoogleTest provides build support and integration for the following build systems:
  - **CMake** (recommended, minimum version 3.14 for fetchcontent support)
  - **Bazel**
  - Other build systems can incorporate GoogleTest manually via source or binary files.

- **Version Control**:
  - Git is used to retrieve the source code, e.g., via `git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git`

---

## 3. Environment Requirements

### Threading Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms where the **pthread** library is available.
- On Windows, threading primitives are provided internally.

### File System

- File system support is required for features like test output capturing and death tests.

### Network and Permissions

- No special network or firewall settings are required to run GoogleTest.
- Running the build system might require permissions to install libraries globally (e.g., `sudo make install` on Linux).

## 4. Minimum Software Requirements

| Component               | Requirement                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Operating System       | Linux, Windows, macOS, Unix-like systems |
| C++ Compiler           | Supports C++17 standard or newer           |
| Build Tool             | CMake 3.14+ for native GoogleTest builds  |
| Git                    | For source code retrieval                   |

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before starting installation, check your environment:

```bash
# Check compiler version (example with gcc)
gcc --version

# Check CMake version
cmake --version

# Check git version
git --version

# Verify C++17 support (using compiler flag)
echo "int main() { return 0; }" > test.cpp
${CXX:-g++} -std=c++17 -o test test.cpp
./test && echo "C++17 supported"
```

If any of these commands fail or show unsupported versions, upgrade the respective components.

---

## 6. Key Compatibility Notes

- GoogleTest requires **C++17 or newer**; earlier standards are not supported.
- On Windows Visual Studio, ensure your compiler version is 2017 Update 3 or later.
- When enabling multi-threaded tests, confirm pthreads (or platform equivalent) is installed and properly configured.

---

## 7. Additional Resources

- Explore the [Setup and Installation](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/setup-intro) section next for detailed installation instructions.
- For platform-specific advice, see the documentation on [Supported Platforms and Integration Ecosystem](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/overview/features-and-getting-started/supported-platforms-and-integrations).

<Tip>
Always verify your compiler and build tools before proceeding to avoid wasted effort and troubleshooting during installation.
</Tip>

<Note>
If you are new to CMake or your build environment, consider consulting the CMake official documentation at https://cmake.org/documentation/ before installing GoogleTest.
