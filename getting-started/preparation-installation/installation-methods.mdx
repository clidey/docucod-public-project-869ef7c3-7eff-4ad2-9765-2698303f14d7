# Installing GoogleTest

This guide delivers clear, step-by-step instructions to obtain, build, and install GoogleTest on your development environment. It includes multiple supported installation methods and helps you select the best workflow for your platform and toolchain.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GoogleTest, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **C++ Standard:** Minimum C++17 support is required to build and run GoogleTest successfully.
- **Build Tools:** CMake 3.13 or later is recommended for ease of building and integration.
- **Operating Systems:** Supported on Linux, Windows, macOS, and other POSIX-compatible platforms.
- **Compiler:** Compatible modern C++ compilers such as GCC, Clang, MSVC, or equivalent.
- **Network Access:** Required if using automated source downloads during build configuration.

<Tip>
Confirm that your system has a working C++17 compiler and a supported version of CMake installed. You can check CMake version by running `cmake --version` and verify your compiler version with `(gcc|clang|cl) --version`.
</Tip>

## 2. Obtaining GoogleTest

There are two primary ways to get GoogleTest source code:

### a. Clone from GitHub

This method allows you to work with the latest version directly:

```bash
# Clone GoogleTest repository
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
cd googletest
```

### b. Download Release Archive

You can download a stable release archive and extract it manually:

- Visit [https://github.com/google/googletest/releases](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases)
- Download the desired version zip or tarball
- Extract it to your desired directory

---

## 3. Building and Installing GoogleTest using CMake

GoogleTest includes a community-supported CMake build system, recommended across platforms.

### Step 1: Create a Build Directory

Create a dedicated directory to keep build files separate:

```bash
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
```

### Step 2: Configure the Build

By default, this will build both GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

```bash
cmake ..
```

If you want **only** GoogleTest without GoogleMock:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

### Step 3: Build the Libraries

On Linux/macOS (with Makefiles):

```bash
make
```

On Windows (with Visual Studio or other generators):

- Open the generated solution (`.sln`) in Visual Studio and build

### Step 4: Install GoogleTest (Optional)

Installing system-wide allows projects to find GoogleTest easily.

```bash
sudo make install
```

By default, this installs under `/usr/local/`.

### Verification

After build, the libraries `libgtest.a` and optionally `libgmock.a` should be created.

<Tip>
To verify installation, try compiling and linking a simple test executable (see step 5).
</Tip>

---

## 4. Alternative: Integrate GoogleTest into your Project with CMake

Rather than installing, you can embed GoogleTest source into your project build.

### Example snippet for `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/5376968f6948923e2411081fd9372e71a59d8e77.zip
)
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE) # For Visual Studio runtimes
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(your_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_test gtest_main)
add_test(NAME your_test COMMAND your_test)
```

This approach guarantees consistent compiler flags and simplifies continuous integration.

---

## 5. Running Your First GoogleTest

Once GoogleTest is built or linked, your test executable should have a `main` function that:

- Initializes GoogleTest with `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);`
- Runs all tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

### Minimal example of a custom main()

```c++
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

To avoid writing this yourself, link with `gtest_main` library, which provides a default main. 

### Compiling and Running a Sample Test

Create file `sample_test.cpp`:

```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

Build command using installed GoogleTest on Linux:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread sample_test.cpp -lgtest_main -lgtest -o sample_test
./sample_test
```

Expect output showing test run summary and PASS status.

## 6. Installation Using Bazel (Optional)

If your project uses Bazel, GoogleTest can be included via Bazel WORKSPACE and BUILD files.

- Add GoogleTest as an external dependency in your Bazel WORKSPACE
- Follow the Bazel-specific instructions on the official GitHub repository

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

<Tip>
If build errors occur:

- Verify CMake version meets minimum 3.13 requirement
- Ensure your compiler supports C++17
- Check installed development tools and environment variables
- On Windows, consider setting `gtest_force_shared_crt` to ON in CMake to align runtimes
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not attempt to manually modify or link against partial GoogleTest sources — always build the entire project or use the provided libraries.
</Warning>

If your tests do not run or are not discovered:

- Verify you call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`
- Make sure the test files are compiled and linked properly
