# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before integrating GoogleTest into your project, it is crucial to understand the minimum supported C++ language version, compatible platforms, required compilers, and dependencies to guarantee a smooth setup and build process.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Version

GoogleTest strictly requires an environment that supports **C++17** or later.

- Ensure your compiler is configured to use at least C++17 by setting the appropriate compiler flags.

### How to specify C++17 in your build system

- **CMake**: Add the following to your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- **Manual compiler flags**: For example, with GCC or Clang, add `-std=c++17`.

> Note: If you are in a mixed-language project or have restrictions in how you can specify flags, you can also pass the standard flag via `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` in CMake.


## 2. Supported Platforms & Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms conforming to [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). The primary platforms include:

- **Linux**
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants with considerations)
- **Mac OS X**
- Various embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52 (with Arduino)

While GoogleTest supports these platforms, some features like stream redirection or death tests may be limited on embedded or mobile platforms.

For the latest detailed compatibility, consult the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).


## 3. Compiler Requirements

To successfully build and use GoogleTest, your compiler must meet these minimum requirements:

| Compiler                          | Minimum Version                    | Notes                                                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GCC**                          | 7.0 or higher                    | Full C++17 support needed                                  |
| **Clang**                       | 3.4.1 or higher                  | Must correctly support C++17                               |
| **MS Visual C++ (MSVC)**         | Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (v19.11) or later | Requires VS 2015 or newer; VS 2017 preferred               |
| **Intel LLVM**                  | Latest versions recommended     | Compatible with C++17                                      |

> **Important:** For MSVC, GoogleMock enforces at least Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) to compile.


## 4. Multi-threading & Thread Safety

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms that support `pthread`.
- To ensure proper detection of `pthread`, GoogleTest uses the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` macro.
- If your platform or build system does not properly detect pthread support, you can manually define:

  ```bash
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # or 0 to disable
  ```

- When using CMake, pthread linkage is handled automatically.


## 5. Dependencies & Environment

- **Build tools:** GoogleTest is designed primarily for use with CMake but can be integrated into other build systems.
- **CMake:** Version 3.14 or later is recommended for best compatibility, especially if using FetchContent or the pkg-config support.
- **Pkg-config support**: GoogleTest provides `.pc` files to ease integration with pkg-config-compatible build systems. Ensure your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes the location of these files if installed manually.


## 6. Integration with Build Systems

### Using CMake

- GoogleTest ships with built-in support for CMake.
- To build and install GoogleTest:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
  cd googletest
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install
  ```

- For building only GoogleTest (no GoogleMock):

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
  make
  ```

- In an existing CMake project, you may integrate GoogleTest using `add_subdirectory()` or via `find_package()` if installed.


### Using pkg-config

- GoogleTest installs pkg-config files (`gtest.pc`, `gtest_main.pc`) with paths and flags to ease integration, including platform-specific compiler flags.
- Ensure the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes the directory where `.pc` files are installed.
- In cross-compilation scenarios, set `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` appropriately to point `.pc` flags inside the sysroot.


## 7. Compiler Flags & Runtime Library Settings

- By default, GoogleTest builds with static runtime linkage on MSVC to avoid runtime DLL dependencies.
- To align GoogleTest’s runtime linkage with your project (e.g., dynamic runtime), use the CMake option:

  ```bash
  -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

- On GCC/Clang, standard C++17 flags and `-pthread` are automatically added when using the provided CMake scripts.


## 8. Limitations and Considerations

- GoogleTest requires C++17; older standards are not supported.
- Some platform-specific features may be limited or disabled (e.g., exceptions, stream redirection, death tests) on embedded or restricted systems.
- GoogleMock requires MSVC 2015 or later on Windows for successful compilation.


## 9. Summary Checklist Before Proceeding

- [ ] Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or later.
- [ ] Verify your operating system and platform are supported.
- [ ] Ensure pthread support or define `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` appropriately.
- [ ] Install and configure build tools, preferably CMake 3.14+.
- [ ] Adjust compiler runtime library flags in alignment with your project.
- [ ] Set environment variables (pkg-config paths, sysroots) if relevant.
