# Prerequisites & System Requirements

GoogleTest is a modern C++ testing and mocking framework designed to integrate seamlessly with your development environment. To ensure successful build and execution of your tests, you need to fulfill certain system and compiler requirements. This guide outlines these prerequisites to prepare your environment for GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a compiler supporting the **C++17 standard** or newer. This ensures compatibility with modern C++ features used extensively within the framework.

- **Minimum C++ Standard**: C++17
- **Supported Compilers**:
  - GCC 7.0 or newer
  - Clang 5.0 or newer
  - MSVC 2017 (version 15.7) or newer

<Note>
Earlier compiler versions or those without full C++17 support will fail to build GoogleTest. Ensure your build system sets the appropriate standard flags such as `-std=c++17` (for GCC/Clang) or equivalent settings in MSVC.
</Note>

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and supports a wide range of operating systems out of the box:

- **Linux** distributions
- **Windows** (including desktop versions with Visual Studio)
- **Mac OS X** (Xcode environments)

<Info>
GoogleTest detects your platform automatically, providing best possible integration and support based on the environment and system capabilities.
</Info>

## 3. Development Environment Considerations

### Build System Integration

GoogleTest supports multiple build systems conveniently:

- **CMake**: Officially supported with out-of-the-box scripts. CMake version 3.14 or newer is recommended for features like `FetchContent_MakeAvailable`.
- **Manual Integration**: You can clone and manually include GoogleTest source and headers if your build system does not provide package support.

### Multi-threading Support

GoogleTest offers thread-safe execution in environments that support pthreads (POSIX threads). On Windows, this support maps to native Windows synchronization primitives.

- If your platform has pthread support, GoogleTest’s thread safety features are enabled automatically.
- You can explicitly toggle pthread support via the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` compiler option if automatic detection is incorrect.

### Shared vs. Static Libraries

GoogleTest can be built and linked as either a static or shared library:

- To build GoogleTest as a shared library, define `DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` during compilation.
- When linking your tests against the shared GoogleTest library, define `DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

<Note>
Static linking is simpler and typically recommended unless you have specific requirements to use shared libraries.
</Note>

---

## 4. Additional Dependencies

GoogleTest itself has no external dependencies other than a C++17-compliant compiler and standard libraries. However:

- When compiled with Abseil support enabled, GoogleTest depends on Abseil's string utilities and RE2 for enhanced regular expression support.
- Linkers on Linux and other Unix-like systems may require linking with `-lpthread` if pthreads support is enabled.

<Note>
Building GoogleTest within CMake projects usually takes care of dependency management automatically.
</Note>

---

## 5. Known Limitations

- **Exceptions**: GoogleTest works fine with or without C++ exception support enabled, but certain behaviors such as throwing exceptions from assertions require exceptions support.
- **Unicode Support**: Wide string printing and Unicode integration depend on platform support. On Windows, wide strings are encoded as UTF-16 internally.

## 6. Practical Preparation Steps

Follow these steps to prepare your environment for using GoogleTest:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Your Compiler">
Verify your C++ compiler supports at least C++17. For GCC and Clang, run:

```bash
$ gcc --version
$ clang --version
```

Check your MSVC version in Visual Studio to ensure it meets the minimum requirement.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Your Build Environment">
Configure your build system to use C++17 standard. For example, with CMake add:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Resolve Linker Flags">
If your platform uses pthreads, ensure your linker flags include `-lpthread`. This can be done in your CMakeLists or compiler command line.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Installation Method">
You can build GoogleTest as a standalone project and install it system-wide or embed it within your project:

- Standalone build with CMake and make (see Installation & Integration documentation).
- Incorporate with FetchContent or add_subdirectory for seamless integration.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Ignoring Return Value of RUN_ALL_TESTS()**: Always return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()` function to correctly signal test results.

- **Underscores in Test Names**: Avoid underscores in `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` to prevent internal naming collisions and reserved identifier errors.

- **Compiler Errors Related to Static Constants**: If your fixture or test classes have static constant members, ensure they are defined in a source file, not just declared in headers.

- **Dead Tests Hanging in Multi-threaded Environments**: Death tests (`ASSERT_DEATH` / `EXPECT_DEATH`) should be run in environments where multiple threads are carefully managed or avoided; see [Death Test Naming and Threading Considerations](../advanced.md#death-tests).

## 8. Where to Go Next

Now that your environment meets the GoogleTest prerequisites, proceed to **Installation & Integration** guides to build and link GoogleTest with your project:
