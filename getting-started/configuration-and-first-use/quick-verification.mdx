# Quick Verification Checklist

This page provides a concise checklist along with essential troubleshooting insights to help you quickly verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly installed and ready for development. Following these steps ensures your environment is properly configured and that your first tests and mocks will run successfully.

---

## 1. Verify Installation

Before launching into writing tests or mocks, confirm that GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are properly installed and linked:

- **Including Headers:** Check that you can include `<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>` without compilation errors.
- **Linking Libraries:** Ensure your build system links against the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries, such as `-lgtest`, `-lgmock` or equivalent.
- **Compiler Support:** Confirm your compiler supports at least C++17 which is required by GoogleTest/GoogleMock.

<Tip>
Use a simple test program that just includes GoogleTest and runs `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to verify basic setup.
</Tip>

## 2. Confirm Basic Test Execution

Make sure you can compile and run a minimal test case written with GoogleTest:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, AlwaysPasses) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- Compile and run this test binary.
- Success should report all tests passed.

<Check>
If the test fails to compile or run, review your include paths, build links, and compiler setup.
</Check>

## 3. Verify GoogleMock Functionality

To confirm that GoogleMock is working properly:

1. **Create a simple mock class:** Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to mock a basic interface method.
2. **Write a test with `EXPECT_CALL`:** Set up expectations, call the mocked method, and verify interactions.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int Bar() = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (), (override));
};

TEST(MockTest, WorksCorrectly) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar()).WillOnce(testing::Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Bar(), 42);
}
```

- Run the test and verify it passes.

<Note>
Review the [Basic Mocking with GoogleMock](../getting-started/configuration-and-first-use/using-googlemock-basics) guide for detailed explanations.
</Note>

## 4. Understanding gMock Warnings and Errors

GoogleMock emits warnings and errors to help diagnose mock interaction issues, including:

- **Uninteresting calls:** Warnings when mock functions are called without corresponding expectations.
- **Unexpected calls:** Errors when calls do not match declared expectations.
- **Excessive calls:** Errors if a mock method is called more times than expected.
- **Leaked mocks:** Errors reported if mock objects are allocated but never destructed, indicating improper cleanup.

These messages include details such as function signatures, argument matching, call counts, and stack traces to help pinpoint problems.

<Tip>
Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get comprehensive call tracing information during test runs.
</Tip>

## 5. Checklist for Common Issues

| Step                  | Checkpoint                              | Resolution Tip                                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Headers Include       | No errors when including GoogleTest/Mock headers. | Fix include paths and installation.
| Linker Setup          | Linking succeeds with GoogleTest/Mock libraries.  | Adjust your build system linking parameters.
| Simple Test Passes    | A minimal test case runs and passes.              | Confirm build and runtime environment.
| Mock Class Compiles   | `MOCK_METHOD` macros expand correctly.
              | Follow correct mock class syntax.
| Expectations Verified | `EXPECT_CALL` properly triggers verification.
              | Ensure expectations set *before* calls.
| No Leaked Mocks       | No errors about leaked mocks on test exit.         | Properly delete heap-allocated mocks or use `Mock::AllowLeak`.

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Test fails due to missing virtual deconstructor:** Make sure all mocked interfaces have a **virtual destructor**.

- **`Uninteresting mock function call` warnings:** These indicate calls without expectations. If intentional, suppress by wrapping mocks with `NiceMock` or explicitly adding catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`s.

- **Failed expectation messages:** Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace exact expectations and calls.

- **Leaked mocks detected:** Ensure mocks created with `new` are deleted, or consider using smart pointers or test fixtures for automatic cleanup.

- **Compiler errors on `MOCK_METHOD` with template or complex types:** Wrap return or argument types with parentheses or create type aliases as per the [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md#creating-mock-classes).

## 7. Useful Commands to Verify Setup

```bash
# Run your test binary with verbose logging
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info

# Verify test results for passed or failed expectations
./your_test_binary

# Check result of simple mock test
./simple_mock_test
```

## 8. Next Steps

- Dive deeper into mocking features and capabilities with the [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md).
- Learn about setting expectations, matchers, actions, and cardinalities in the [Setting Expectations](../docs/reference/mocking.md#EXPECT_CALL) section.
- Understand how to write effective mock tests in the [Basic Mocking with GoogleMock](../getting-started/configuration-and-first-use/using-googlemock-basics) guide.
- Explore common pitfalls and best practices in the [gMock Cheat Sheet](../docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md).
