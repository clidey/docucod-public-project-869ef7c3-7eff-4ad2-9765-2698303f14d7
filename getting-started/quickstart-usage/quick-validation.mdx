# Validating Your Setup

Ensure your GoogleTest environment is correctly installed and configured by building and running sample tests. This simple validation workflow confirms that your test framework is operational before you start writing complex test cases.

---

## 1. Confirm GoogleTest Installation

Before proceeding, verify that GoogleTest has been installed following the appropriate installation instructions [Installing with CMake](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake) or [Installing with Bazel](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-bazel).

### Step:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command in your build directory where GoogleTest has been configured:

```bash
cmake --build . --target gtest_main
```

This command builds the GoogleTest frameworks, including the main test runner.

<Tip>
If you are using Bazel, build your test binary with:

```bash
bazel build //:gtest_main
```

Consult your build system documentation for exact targets.
</Tip>


## 2. Build a Sample Test

To validate your setup practically, compile a simple test program.

### Sample Test Code:

Create a file named `sample_test.cpp` with the following contents:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A trivial test case.
TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

### Build Instructions:

Assuming you are using CMake, add this sample test to your build file or compile directly:

```bash
# Compile using g++ and link against gtest and pthread (Linux example)
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o sample_test
```

If using CMake, an example CMakeLists.txt snippet:

```cmake
add_executable(sample_test sample_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(sample_test gtest gtest_main pthread)
```

<Tip>
On Windows, adjust linker flags appropriately, often linking to `gtest.lib` and `gtest_main.lib`.
</Tip>

## 3. Run the Sample Test

Execute the built test binary:

```bash
./sample_test
```

Expected Output:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This output confirms that GoogleTest was successfully built and that tests run as expected.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Validation Issues">
<Accordion title="Test Binary Fails To Build">
Ensure your compiler is configured for C++17 or later, as required by GoogleTest. Check include paths and link flags. Refer to [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Binary Runs But No Tests Are Found">
Verify that you linked your test binary against `gtest_main`. Without it, test discovery and execution will not function.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Fail Unexpectedly">
Run your test binary with increased verbosity:

```bash
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=info
```

This will show detailed logging around mock calls and expectations. Correct any environment or build misconfiguration found.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Next Steps

- With your environment confirmed, proceed to writing real tests: see [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/quickstart-usage/writing-first-test).
- Configure your environment and build system integration further: see [Environment Configuration](/getting-started/quickstart-usage/configuration-overview).
- For advanced mocking techniques and examples, consult the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html).

---

## Additional Tips

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly while setting up your mock behaviors with `ON_CALL` to avoid brittle tests.
- Employ `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug mock expectations and understand call matching.
- Consider using `NiceMock` to suppress warnings about uninteresting calls during early test development.

<Tip>
Remember that validating your setup is a critical step to ensure confidence in your test results as you move to more complex cases.

### Reflecting GoogleTest Concepts

This page directly supports the user's intention to validate the installation and basic configuration of GoogleTest before progressing further. It ties neatly with other Getting Started pages by providing a user-centric, practical flow that culminates in a successful test run, including actionable troubleshooting guidance.


---

# Sample Minimal Example Test Code

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(DummyTest, TrueIsTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and run this to validate.

---

# Troubleshooting Strategy

- Ensure GoogleTest libraries are linked and up to date.
- Verify compiler and C++ standard compliance.
- Check that your test discovery mechanism is active—using `gtest_main` or providing a `main()`.

# Common Fixes

- Link explicitly against `gtest` and `gtest_main`.
- Confirm environment variables and build flags.
- Rebuild GoogleTest if corrupted or partial.

<Check>
Validation complete when `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` results in one or more test cases passing without errors and shows "[  PASSED  ]" summary.
</Check>
