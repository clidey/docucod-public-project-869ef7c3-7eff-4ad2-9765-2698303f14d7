# Prerequisite Tools & Dependencies

This page details the essential tools, libraries, and environment configurations required before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Ensuring the appropriate prerequisites are in place will help you build and run tests smoothly, taking full advantage of GoogleMock's mocking capabilities.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Support

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require support for at least the **C++17** standard. This includes compilers and build environments that meet or exceed this level of C++ language support.

### Supported Compiler Features

- Full support for C++17 language features.
- Standard library support aligned with C++17.

If your compiler does not fully support C++17, upgrade to a version that does. Without this, the build process will fail, and the framework will not function correctly.

---

## 2. Build Tools

You need one or more build tools to compile, link, and run GoogleTest/GoogleMock:

### a. CMake

- Required for CMake-based projects and installation.
- Compatible with GoogleTest's CMake build files.
- Minimum version depends on your platform and GoogleTest release; generally, CMake 3.10 or higher is recommended.

### b. Bazel

- An alternative build system supported by GoogleTest, suitable for projects using Bazel workflows.
- Ensure Bazel is installed and working.

Choose the build tool that matches your project needs and environment configuration. Both options are fully supported.

---

## 3. Optional Dependencies

GoogleTest can optionally use Google's **Abseil** library for additional utilities and abstractions.

- This dependency is optional and not required for basic use.
- If you choose to integrate with Abseil, ensure it is installed and available to your build system.

---

## 4. System Environment Configuration

### Compiler and OS Compatibility

- Supported operating systems must be compatible with C++17 and your chosen build tools.
- Verify your compiler is compatible with supported platforms by consulting the [Supported Platforms & Requirements](https://google.github.io/googletest/overview/integration-ecosystem/supported-platforms.html).

### Environment Variables and Paths

- Ensure paths to compiler executables and build tools are set in your system environment.
- If using Abseil or other optional libraries, configure your include and library paths accordingly.

| Requirement           | Description                             | Recommended Version/Notes                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| C++ Compiler         | Supports C++17 standard                | GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+, etc.          |
| Build Tool           | CMake or Bazel installed               | CMake 3.10+, Bazel latest stable            |
| Optional Dependencies| Abseil library if needed               | Latest compatible Abseil release             |
| OS                   | Linux, Windows, macOS supported        | See Supported Platforms page for details    |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Compilation Fails due to Unsupported C++ Standard

- **Cause:** Your compiler does not support C++17 or the flag enabling it is missing.
- **Solution:** Upgrade your compiler or configure your build tool to enable C++17 explicitly (e.g., `-std=c++17` flag).

### Issue: Build Tool Not Found

- **Cause:** CMake or Bazel is not installed or not in your system `PATH`.
- **Solution:** Install the build tool and add it to your environment paths.

### Issue: Missing Optional Dependencies

- **Cause:** When integrating with optional libraries like Abseil, missing headers or libraries cause build errors.
- **Solution:** Install the missing dependencies and configure your build system to locate them.

---

## Additional Tips

- Always verify your compiler and build tool versions before beginning installation.
- For cross-platform projects, check topology-specific requirements on the [Supported Platforms & Requirements](https://google.github.io/googletest/overview/integration-ecosystem/supported-platforms.html).
- Use the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/setup-foundations/system-requirements.html) page for detailed guidance on platform compatibility.
- Consider containerized environments for consistent build setups.
