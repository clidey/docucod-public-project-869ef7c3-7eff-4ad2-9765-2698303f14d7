# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the system requirements, supported platforms, compiler compatibility, and C++ standard prerequisites for running GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It serves as a vital foundation before installation and integration, ensuring your environment can support the framework reliably and efficiently.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Version Requirement

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17 or later**. Attempting to build or use GoogleTest with older C++ standards is unsupported and will result in build failures.

### Recommendations

- When using CMake, specify the C++ standard explicitly at your project’s top-level CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If you cannot specify it globally (e.g., in mixed-language projects), add the appropriate compiler flags manually:

```bash
# Example for GCC or Clang
-std=c++17

# For MSVC
/std:c++17
```

Failure to meet this minimum version will cause explicit errors, such as:

```
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
```

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports an extensive range of platforms, reflecting Google's broad development environment requirements. The detection and support are handled internally by macros defined during compilation.

## 3. Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest supports most modern C++ compilers meeting the C++17 requirement, including but not limited to:

- **GCC** (4.8+ recommended, newer versions preferred)
- **Clang/LLVM** (3.4.1+ recommended)
- **MSVC** (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 / MSVC 19.11+)
- **Intel C++ Compiler**
- **Sun Pro CC**
- **IBM XL C++**
- **Borland C++** (with some limitations)

### Version Checks and Errors

- Trying to build with MSVC versions less than 2015 will produce an error, e.g.,

```
#error "At least Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is required to compile Google Mock."
```

- Compiler flags related to RTTI and exception handling will be set or are expected to be set in typical configurations. Avoid disabling RTTI or exceptions as GoogleTest requires these features.

### Special Notes

- GoogleTest detects compiler features like exception support, RTTI availability, and threading via macros during compilation.

- It defines internal flags such as `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`, and `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` accordingly.

- You can override or tweak these configurations by manually defining macros (e.g., via `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`) in your build.


---

## 4. Threading and Synchronization

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** if pthreads or native Windows threading APIs are available.
- Thread safety detection is automatic, but can be overridden by defining `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`.
- When enabled, GoogleTest uses mutexes, thread-local storage, condition variables, and other synchronization primitives internally.

<Note>
Ensure that your build system links against the pthread library (`-pthread`) if required, as failing to do so will cause linker errors.
</Note>

---

## 5. Platform-Specific Features and Support

### POSIX Regular Expressions

- GoogleTest uses enhanced POSIX Extended Regular Expressions on supported platforms.
- On some platforms (Windows, embedded, etc.), it falls back to a simplified regex implementation.

### Stream Redirection

- GoogleTest supports redirection of stdout and stderr for death tests on most desktop platforms.
- Stream redirection is disabled on mobile and embedded platforms such as Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, Windows RT, ESP8266, and others.

### Death Tests

- Enabled on platforms with file system support and certain OS types, including Linux, macOS (not iOS), Windows Desktop editions, FreeBSD, and others.

---

## 6. Filesystem and Path Support

- GoogleTest assumes the presence of a POSIX-like file system on most platforms.
- Windows-specific support uses native Windows calls for file operations.
- Use of wide strings (UTF-16) is standard on Windows; UTF-8 paths on POSIX systems.

---

## 7. Build System Integration Tips

- **CMake** (recommended): GoogleTest requires C++17 and threading support; CMake scripts handle most platform and compiler quirks automatically.
- **Bazel**: Platform-specific configurations and macros ensure proper detection of threading and compiler features.
- **pkg-config**: Provided `.pc` files help configure compile and link flags to satisfy platform-specific requirements.

<Tip>
When integrating GoogleTest into custom build systems, ensure your compiler and linker flags include appropriate threading libraries (`-pthread` or equivalent) and define necessary macros for your platform.
</Tip>

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

| Issue                                   | Cause                                      | Resolution                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Build fails with C++ version errors     | C++ standard less than 17                   | Use `-std=c++17` or higher compiler flag     |
| Linker errors related to pthread        | Missing pthread linking flags               | Add `-pthread` to compiler and linker flags  |
| MSVC build errors about runtime library | Mismatch between static and dynamic CRT    | Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` or align runtimes |
| Undefined macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`| Build system does not correctly detect OS  | Verify compiler defines; define macros if necessary |

# Additional Tips

- Regularly verify your build environment matches the required C++17 standard level.
- For cross-compilation, explicitly confirm your toolchain supports all GoogleTest features.
- Consult the official platform matrix for the latest supported versions of compilers and OS.

For the most reliable results, build and test GoogleTest within supported environments and maintain alignment with recommended compiler versions and configurations.
