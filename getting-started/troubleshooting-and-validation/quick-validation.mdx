# Quick Installation Check

Verify your GoogleTest setup quickly by running a minimal test. This guide provides immediate commands and instructions to confirm that GoogleTest is installed, linked correctly, and able to run a simple test executable.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Check

The Quick Installation Check helps you rapidly validate that:

- GoogleTest is properly installed on your system.
- Your project can compile and link against GoogleTest libraries.
- The test executable runs and produces expected test output.

This page provides minimal sample code and commands to avoid confusion and speed up troubleshooting.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before running this check, ensure:

- You have installed GoogleTest following the steps outlined in the [Installing GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/installation.md) guide.
- Your compiler supports C++17 or later.
- Necessary build tools like CMake are installed if you are building from source.
- System environment paths are set correctly so that the compiler and linker can find GoogleTest headers and libraries.

<Tip>
If you are unsure about proper installation or encounter build errors, please first consult the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/prerequisites.md) and [Installing GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/installation.md) guides.
</Tip>

## 3. Minimal Sample Test Code

Create a minimal C++ test file named `quick_install_test.cpp` with the following content. This test verifies that GoogleTest is correctly linked and can run a basic assertion:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A trivial test.
TEST(QuickInstallTest, BasicAssertion) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Description:
- Includes the GoogleTest header.
- Defines a simple test suite `QuickInstallTest` with a single test `BasicAssertion`.
- Within the test, asserts that 1 + 1 equals 2.
- The main function initializes GoogleTest and runs all tests.

---

## 4. Build Instructions

### 4.1. Using CMake

If you have GoogleTest installed system-wide or as a submodule, create a simple `CMakeLists.txt` in the directory of `quick_install_test.cpp`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
project(QuickInstallCheck)

find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(quick_install_test quick_install_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(quick_install_test GTest::gtest_main)

include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(quick_install_test)
```

#### Steps:

1. Create a build folder:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Run CMake configuration:

```bash
cmake ..
```

3. Build the test executable:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

4. Run tests:

```bash
ctest
```

You should see output indicating the test passed.

### 4.2. Manual Compilation (Example for Linux with GCC)

If you prefer to compile manually and know the location of GoogleTest headers and libraries, use:

```bash
# Replace /path/to/gtest_include and /path/to/gtest_lib with actual paths

g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/gtest_include -pthread \
    quick_install_test.cpp -L/path/to/gtest_lib -lgtest_main -lgtest -o quick_install_test
```

Run the test:

```bash
./quick_install_test
```

### 4.3. Using Package Managers

If on Linux or MacOS with package managers like `apt`, `brew`, or `vcpkg`, you can install GoogleTest and compile against it similarly. See [Installing GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/installation.md) for platform-specific instructions.

---

## 5. Running the Quick Installation Test

After building, execute the test binary:

```bash
./quick_install_test
```

**Expected output snippet:**

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from QuickInstallTest
[ RUN      ] QuickInstallTest.BasicAssertion
[       OK ] QuickInstallTest.BasicAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from QuickInstallTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

When you observe this successful test output, your GoogleTest installation and environment are confirmed to be working.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Quick Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors: Header Files Not Found">
- Ensure that `-isystem` or `-I` points to the correct location of `gtest/gtest.h`.
- Verify GoogleTest installation and header files presence.
- Check include paths in your build system or compiler command.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors: Undefined References to GTest Symbols">
- Confirm linking against both `libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a` (or their shared library equivalents).
- Check that library paths `-L/path/to/gtest_lib` are correctly set.
- Ensure consistent build configurations (e.g., compiler, standard, threading) between your code and GoogleTest.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Execution Issues: Tests Not Running or Crashing">
- Confirm that your `main()` calls `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Ensure your test binary is not trying to load incompatible runtime libraries.
- For multithreaded or dependency-heavy projects, isolate the test to this minimal example.
- Check environment variables that may interfere with test execution such as `GTEST_FILTER`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use the verbose `--gtest_list_tests` flag:

```bash
./quick_install_test --gtest_list_tests
```

to list all detected tests. This helps verify discovery is working.
</Tip>
