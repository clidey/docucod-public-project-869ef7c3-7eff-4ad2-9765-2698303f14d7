# Common Setup Issues & Solutions

This page addresses frequently encountered installation and configuration errors encountered while setting up GoogleTest and GoogleMock, with practical, step-by-step solutions. It covers common compiler, linker, and build system problems across supported platforms such as Linux, Windows, and macOS.

---

## 1. Compiler Errors

**Issue:** Compilation fails when using `MOCK_METHOD` due to unprotected commas in template arguments or incorrect macro usage.

**Solution:**

- When mocking methods with template arguments that contain commas, wrap the argument types in extra parentheses or use type aliases.

  ```cpp
  // Incorrect - will not compile
  MOCK_METHOD(std::pair<bool, int>, GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, (std::map<int, double>, bool));

  // Correct - wrap argument with parentheses
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool));

  // Alternatively, use type aliases
  using BoolAndInt = std::pair<bool, int>;
  MOCK_METHOD(BoolAndInt, GetPair, ());
  using MapIntDouble = std::map<int, double>;
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, (MapIntDouble, bool));
  ```

- Ensure that `MOCK_METHOD` macros are placed in the **public** section of the mock class, even if the base method is private or protected.

- If mocking `const` methods, specify `(const, override)` as the 4th argument.

**Tip:** Avoid adding `const` top-level qualifiers to function parameters to prevent MSVC warnings (see legacy VC++ bugs section).


## 2. Linker Errors

**Issue:** Linker errors occur due to missing implementations or incorrect build configurations.

**Solution:**

- Verify that you are linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries properly.
- If building from source, ensure your build system (CMake or Bazel) includes the necessary targets and dependencies.
- If using pre-built libraries or package managers, confirm that library paths and names are correctly specified.

**Tip:** Check for platform-specific notes and compiler flag requirements, such as C++17 standards compliance and pthread linking on Linux.


## 3. Build System Problems

**Issue:** Build fails or tests fail to run due to misconfiguration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock in CMake or Bazel.

**Solution:**

- Follow the official configuration guides for your build system to add include directories and link to the `gtest` and `gmock` targets properly.
- Use the recommended methods to incorporate GoogleTest as a subdirectory or fetch content (in CMake).
- Specify compiler standard explicitly: `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)`.
- On Windows, ensure proper handling of calling conventions if using `Calltype` qualifiers.

**Tip:** Run the `quick-validation` tests after building to verify the configuration.


## 4. Common Runtime Errors and Warnings

### 4.1 Uninteresting Mock Function Calls Warning

Occurs when a mock method is called without a corresponding `EXPECT_CALL`.

**How to Resolve:**

- If the calls are expected but not explicitly checked, add an `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress warnings.

  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, SomeMethod(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
  ```

- Alternatively, wrap the mock object with `NiceMock` to suppress all such warnings.

### 4.2 Unexpected Mock Function Call Failure

Occurs when a mock method call does not match any active `EXPECT_CALL`.

**How to Resolve:**

- Review your test expectations. Ensure that the method call arguments match the constraints in `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to see detailed mock call traces and stack traces for diagnosing mismatches.

### 4.3 Excessive Call Failure

Occurs when a mock method is called more times than specified.

**How to Resolve:**

- Relax the call count using `Times(AtLeast(n))`, `Times(AnyNumber())`, or adjust `.WillOnce()/.WillRepeatedly()` clauses accordingly.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` when you want an expectation to become inactive after the expected calls are fulfilled.

### 4.4 Default Action Missing

If a mock function has no default action (via `ON_CALL`) and is called unexpectedly, you may see this failure.

**How to Resolve:**

- Define default actions using `ON_CALL` to prevent unexpected call failures.

### 4.5 Compiler Warnings on Const Parameters (MSVC-specific)

Related to MSVC warning C4301 or C4373 when mocking methods with `const int` parameters.

**How to Resolve:**

- Remove top-level const qualifiers from parameters of virtual functions and mocks, as these are ignored by C++ and cause MSVC bugs.


## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info`** to get detailed logs on expectations matched, uninteresting and unexpected calls, including stack traces.
- **Verify that your mocks are destroyed properly** to ensure expectations are verified. Memory leaks of mock objects cause silent test failures.
- **Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)`** to force verification if mock destruction timing is uncertain.
- **When mocking overloaded methods**, disambiguate them using `Const()` wrapper for const methods or specify exact matcher types.
- For asynchronous tests, use synchronization primitives such as `Notification` combined with actions.
- Consult the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html) for platform and common quirks.


## 6. Platform-Specific Notes

- Linux: Remember to link `pthread` for threading support.
- Windows: Use `Calltype()` qualifier in `MOCK_METHOD` if your interface uses certain calling conventions.
- macOS: Ensure Xcode command line tools are correctly installed with required C++17 support.

<Accordion title="Compiler Errors: Common Causes and Fixes">
When you encounter compilation issues with `MOCK_METHOD`, verify that:

- You wrap template or comma-containing argument types with extra parentheses or use type aliases.
- `MOCK_METHOD` declarations reside in the public section of your mock class.
- For const or noexcept methods, the correct specifiers `(const, override)`, `(noexcept, override)`, etc., are used.

Incorrect example:
```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(std::pair<bool, int>, GetPair, ()); // Fails due to comma
```
Corrected example:
```cpp
MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linker Errors">
Check:

- Linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries in your build system.
- Correct include and library paths.
- Proper C++ standard and threading libraries (e.g., pthread on Linux).

Ensure your build commands or CMakeLists.txt properly reference these.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build System Integration Issues">
- For CMake, use correct `add_subdirectory` or FetchContent method to include GoogleTest.
- Specify C++17 standard explicitly.
- Verify Bazel build files for correct targets.
- Validate the configuration by building and running minimal example tests.
</Accordion>

<AccordionGroup title="Common Runtime Issues & Solutions">
