# Quick Validation & Success Checklist

Ensure that your GoogleTest installation is functional and your environment is correctly configured by following this concise validation and success checklist. These steps provide confidence that you can now proceed to write more complex tests with a reliable setup.

---

## 1. Verify GoogleTest Setup Environment

### 1.1 Confirm Compiler and Environment Compatibility
- Make sure your compiler supports **C++17** or higher.
- Ensure that system libraries (e.g., pthreads on Linux) are installed and functional if required.
- Confirm build tools like **CMake** or **Bazel** are properly installed.

### 1.2 Validate GoogleTest and GoogleMock Include Paths
- Confirm the paths to `gtest/gtest.h` and `gmock/gmock.h` are correctly configured in your build files.

### 1.3 Check Linking Configuration
- Ensure your test target links against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Verify runtime linkage, for example the GoogleTest shared library if used, is accessible.

---

## 2. Compile and Run a Basic Test

### 2.1 Create a Minimal Sample Test Source
Write a simple test file `sample_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### 2.2 Build Sample Test
If using CMake, your `CMakeLists.txt` might contain:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
add_executable(sample_test sample_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(sample_test GTest::gtest_main GTest::gmock_main pthread)
```

Then build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### 2.3 Run the Test Executable

```bash
./build/sample_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest
[ RUN      ] SimpleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SimpleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest (1 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

Success indicates your installation and environment are functioning correctly.

## 3. Validate GoogleMock Functionality

### 3.1 Write a Simple Mock Class and Test

Create a file `mock_test.cc` with the following:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int DoBar(int x) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, DoBar, (int x), (override));
};

TEST(MockTest, SimpleMockBehavior) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoBar(42)).WillOnce(testing::Return(100));

  int result = mock.DoBar(42);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 100);
}
```

### 3.2 Compile and Run Mock Test
Build and run `mock_test.cc` similarly to the basic test and expect a successful run.

---

## 4. Verify Installation Through Command Line

Run following commands and observe expected outputs.

### 4.1 Check GoogleTest Version

```bash
gtest --version
```
Expected Output: Version info (your installed version).

### 4.2 Run Tests With Verbose Logging

Run tests with verbose output to trace mock calls and assertions:

```bash
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=info
```
Look for detailed logs of each expectation and mock invocation.

<Tip>
For troubleshooting, increase verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock function call traces.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Missing Virtual Destructors
Ensure all interfaces to be mocked have **virtual destructors**. Without this, you will encounter heap checker errors and undefined behavior.

### 5.2 Over-specifying Expectations
Avoid setting more expectations than needed, which can cause false failures. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only when verifying calls.

### 5.3 Method Overloading
When mocking overloaded methods, specify exact signatures or use techniques like `using` to disambiguate.

### 5.4 Linking Errors
Verify your build scripts correctly link both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries, and that runtime search paths are configured.

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-debugging/writing-running-first-test) for creating real test scenarios.
- Explore [Mocking Basics](/guides/core-workflows/mocking-basics) to deepen understanding of mock usage.
- Review [Build, Configure, and Validate Your Installation](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation-setup/build-configure-validate) for detailed installation guidance.
- Use [gMock Cheatsheet](docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md) and [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for advanced mocking techniques.

_By completing these validation steps, you can be confident your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup is correct, allowing you to write robust C++ unit tests with mocking as needed._
