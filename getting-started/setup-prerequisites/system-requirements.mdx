# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Learn about minimum C++ standards, supported operating systems, compilers, and environments needed to run GoogleTest. Stay up to date on what's required to ensure compatibility with the framework.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires an environment supporting **C++17** or higher. Attempting to compile with an earlier C++ standard will result in a compilation error, as GoogleTest uses modern language features unavailable in older standards.

> This requirement is strictly enforced at compile-time using a static check. Make sure your compiler and build system are configured to use at least C++17.

### How to specify C++17 in your build system

- **CMake:** Set the following in your `CMakeLists.txt`:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)  # Optional: disables GNU extensions
  ```

- **Compiler flags:** If not using CMake, ensure your compiler flags include one of the following:
  - GCC / Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - MSVC: Use `/std:c++17` or higher


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms, with stable support tested on:

- **Linux** (including variants such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Windows Store/WinRT)
- **macOS** (and iOS to some extent)

While GoogleTest attempts to detect the platform automatically, here are key points:

- The platform macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC` are defined internally and should not be manually overridden.
- GoogleTest supports additional Unix-like platforms such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and others, but these may have less stable support due to limited testing.
- Embedded or mobile platforms (e.g., ESP8266, Windows Phone) have limited or no support for some features such as streaming or death tests.


## 3. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest supports modern C++ compilers that correctly handle C++17. Supported compilers include:

- **GCC** (version 7.0.0 and later recommended)
- **Clang** (version 3.4.1 and later recommended)
- **MSVC** (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 and later)
- **Intel C++ Compiler (IntelLLVM)**
- **SunPro, VisualAge/XL, HP aCC** compilers are recognized but may have limited or custom support


## 4. Threading Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** when the pthreads library is available and enabled.
- On Windows, native threading primitives are used.
- If pthreads is not available or disabled (e.g., for embedded platforms), GoogleTest falls back to a non-thread-safe implementation. In these environments:
  - Use of multiple threads in tests may lead to undefined behavior.
  - Some features, such as death tests and test parallelization, might be unavailable.

You can explicitly control pthread usage with:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Force enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Force disable
```


## 5. Exception and RTTI Support

- GoogleTest detects whether **exceptions** and **RTTI** are enabled in your compiler and configures itself accordingly.
- You **can** use GoogleTest in environments without exceptions or RTTI, but certain features may be limited.

Important macros:

- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`: Set to 1 if exceptions are enabled, 0 otherwise.
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`: Set to 1 if RTTI is enabled, 0 otherwise.


## 6. Regular Expression Support

GoogleTest uses regular expressions internally for matching and filtering tests. It selects the available regex implementation among:

- **RE2** (when compiled with Abseil, RE2 is required)
- **POSIX Extended Regular Expressions** (on UNIX-like platforms)
- **GoogleTest's own simple regex** otherwise


## 7. File System and Stream Redirection

- GoogleTest requires a file system to support many features, like death tests.
- Most platforms support this; some embedded or mobile platforms do not.
- Stream redirection (to capture stdout/stderr for assertions) is supported on most desktop and server platforms, but disabled on certain mobile or embedded systems by default.


## 8. Using GoogleTest on Your Platform

### Quick Verification

- Check that your platform supports C++17 and has a compatible compiler.
- Build GoogleTest using CMake with recommended options.
- Review build logs for detected threading, exception, and RTTI support.

### Common Pitfalls

- Not specifying the C++17 standard causes build errors.
- Mixing runtime libraries on Windows (Static vs Dynamic CRT) may cause linking issues.
- Lack of pthreads may disable thread safety.
- Building GoogleTest as a shared library requires additional compiler flags.


## 9. Additional Notes

- GoogleTest automatically defines platform and feature macros internally; manual overrides should be rare and only for advanced use cases.
- Customization points are available via `gtest/internal/custom/` headers if you need to provide platform-specific tweaks.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Issues with Platform Compatibility">

### Build Fails Due to Incorrect C++ Standard

Ensure your compiler is set to use C++17 or later. For CMake, configure:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED=ON
```

### Linking Errors on Windows Due to CRT Mismatch

If you see runtime library mismatch errors on Windows (e.g., MTd vs MDd), enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake:
```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

### Threading Support Not Detected

If your platform supports pthread but GoogleTest does not detect it, try to force enable with:
```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

### Features Disabled on Embedded Platforms

GoogleTest disables some features on embedded/mobile targets (e.g., no file system or no stream redirection).
Consider if your environment requires custom platform tuning or disabling GoogleTest features.

By knowing your system meets these requirements, you ensure a smooth GoogleTest setup and reliable testing experience.
