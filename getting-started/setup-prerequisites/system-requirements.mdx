# System Requirements for GoogleTest

GoogleTest is a powerful, open-source C++ testing framework designed to support robust and portable testing across diverse platforms. To successfully build and run GoogleTest, your development environment must meet specific compiler, platform, and build tool requirements outlined in this guide.

---

## 1. Minimum Compiler and Language Standards

- **C++ Standard**: GoogleTest requires a compiler that fully supports **C++17** or a higher standard. Attempting to compile with standards lower than C++17 will result in errors.

- **Compiler Versions**:
  - Official support aligns with the [Google Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).
  - A comprehensive compatibility matrix of supported compilers and versions is maintained and updated on the [oss-policies-info repository](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

- **Supported Compilers Include**:
  - GCC (supporting C++17 and above)
  - Clang (supporting C++17 and above)
  - MSVC 2017 Update 3 and later
  - Intel LLVM (compatible versions)


## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is compatible with a wide range of operating systems and environments:

- **Desktop OS**:
  - Linux
  - Windows Desktop (including MinGW)
  - Mac OS X

- **Unix-like OS**:
  - FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
  - Solaris
  - AIX, HP-UX
  - Others with POSIX support

- **Mobile & Embedded**:
  - Windows Mobile (limited)
  - Android (as supported by compatible compilers)
  - iOS

GoogleTest automatically detects the target platform and configures itself accordingly. If your platform is unusual or embedded, verify support using the platform macros as described in the GoogleTest source.

## 3. Required Build Tools and Environment

- **Build Systems Supported**:
  - CMake (recommended for cross-platform builds)
  - Bazel (optional, separate guidance available)
  - Other build systems utilizing pkg-config can integrate GoogleTest using the `.pc` configuration files.

- **Threading Support**: 
  GoogleTest is thread-safe on systems where the `pthreads` library is available. Thread support is automatically detected based on platform capabilities.

- **Shared Library Considerations**:
  - To build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows), compile with the flag `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.
  - Tests using the shared GoogleTest library should compile with `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

- **Exception and RTTI Support**:
  - GoogleTest detects and adapts to whether C++ exceptions and RTTI are enabled on your compiler.

## 4. Platform and Compiler Feature Macros

GoogleTest leverages internal macros to finely tune compilation:

- **Feature Detection Macros** (auto-detected unless overridden):
  - `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`
  - `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`
  - `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`
  - `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`
  - `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`
  - `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` (platform dependent)

- **Platform Macros** (defined automatically):
  - `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and more for specific OS variants.

If your build tool or environment disables certain features (e.g., exceptions or pthreads), you may need to explicitly define these macros in your build configuration.

## 5. Links to Compatibility and Platform Information

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Set C++ Standard to C++17**: Ensure your build system is configured to compile with at least C++17. For CMake, use:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- **Verify Compiler Compatibility**: Check your compiler version and platform support before integration.

- **Threading Flags**: When using your own build scripts, link against pthreads if on POSIX systems.

- **Shared Library Flags**: Use recommended flags for building/using shared versions to avoid linkage issues.

- **Override Macros with Caution**: Only explicitly define internal macros (starting with `GTEST_`) if you have a specific need and understand the impact.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

- Compilation fails due to unsupported C++ standard:
  - Confirm and set your compiler to use C++17 or above.

- Linker errors related to pthreads on Linux:
  - Add `-pthread` to both compiler and linker flags.

- Issues on Windows related to runtime mismatch:
  - Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option when building with CMake to align runtime libraries.

- Missing definitions for platform macros:
  - Ensure your build is targeting a supported platform with proper compiler support.

## 8. Example: Setting C++ Standard in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(MyGoogleTestProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(runTests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(runTests PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main pthread)

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME runTests COMMAND runTests)
```

<CalloutNote>
**Note:** GoogleTest requires C++17 as a minimum. Building with earlier standards is unsupported and will fail compilation.
</CalloutNote>

<CalloutTip>
**Tip:** Use the official compatibility matrix to verify support for your target OS and compiler version for a smooth integration.
</CalloutTip>

<CalloutWarning>
**Warning:** Defining internal GoogleTest macros without thorough knowledge can break your build and is not recommended unless advised.
