# Obtaining GoogleTest

This guide provides clear, actionable steps to acquire GoogleTest, the widely-used C++ testing framework. Whether you prefer cloning the repository directly, downloading release archives, or including GoogleTest as a dependency using your build system, this document clarifies the recommended methods tailored to your project and build environment.

---

## 1. Choose Your Acquisition Method

Depending on your project setup and preferences, you can obtain GoogleTest in one of the following ways:

- **Cloning the GitHub repository**: Appropriate if you want the latest development version or to contribute.
- **Downloading release archives**: Best for stable, tested versions.
- **Including as a dependency via build systems like CMake**: Ideal for automated and repeatable builds.


## 2. Cloning the Repository

This method is well suited if you want to **work directly with the source**—for example, to explore the latest updates or contribute.

### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your terminal">
Ensure you have Git installed. You can verify by running:

```bash
git --version
```
If Git is missing, install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
</Step>

<Step title="Clone the googletest repository">
Run the following command to clone the main branch of GoogleTest:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
```

This downloads the entire project into a local folder named `googletest`.
</Step>

<Step title="Checkout specific release tag (optional)">
If you want a stable release, switch to a released version tag. For example, for version v1.17.0:

```bash
cd googletest

git checkout v1.17.0
```

This ensures you’re using a tested version.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Cloning provides full access to sources and history.
When working with multiple contributors or CI systems, pin your version explicitly using tags or commit hashes.
</Check>

## 3. Downloading Release Archives

If your priority is stability and simplicity, **download a release archive** from the GitHub releases page.

### Steps:

1. Go to the GoogleTest GitHub releases page: 

   https://github.com/google/googletest/releases

2. Select the release version you want (e.g., v1.17.0).
3. Download the source code archive in `.zip` or `.tar.gz` format.
4. Extract the archive to a suitable directory in your project or workspace.

<Note>
Using release archives simplifies dependency management in environments that do not support Git or prefer standalone source snapshots.
</Note>

## 4. Including GoogleTest as a Dependency in Your Build

Modern C++ projects often use build tools like CMake to **automatically fetch and include GoogleTest** in your builds, facilitating easier dependency management.

### Using CMake's FetchContent

If your project uses CMake (version 3.14+), you can add GoogleTest as a dependency as follows:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.zip
)
# For Windows: Prevent overriding the parent project's compiler/linker settings
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

- Replace `v1.17.0` with the release version you need.
- `gtest_force_shared_crt` sets runtime library linking policy particularly for Visual Studio.

### Tips

- This approach keeps your test dependencies up to date easily.
- It ensures the same compiler and linker settings between your tests and GoogleTest.

## 5. Choosing the Best Method for Your Project

| Method                          | When to Use                                                      | Pros                               | Cons                            |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Git clone**                  | You want latest code or to contribute.                          | Full source and history access.   | Requires Git; manual updates.  |
| **Release download**           | Stable, tested versions preferred; no Git.                      | Stable snapshots; easy offline use| Updates must be manual.        |
| **Build system dependency**   | Automated builds; CI/CD integration; modern CMake projects.     | Automatic fetch and integration.  | Requires CMake 3.14+; some setup needed. |

## 6. Verifying Your Acquisition

After obtaining the source:

1. Ensure the expected files exist (e.g., `googletest/include/gtest` directory and sources like `googletest/src/gtest-all.cc`).
2. Follow your preferred installation and build method (see "Installing with CMake and Bazel" in the documentation).
3. Run sample or test code to confirm proper integration.

<Check>
On cloning or download, the main directory contains README files and subdirectories like `googletest` and `googlemock` (if included).
</Check>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Acquisition Issues">
<Accordion title="Git Clone Fails or Is Slow">
- Verify internet connectivity.
- Use shallow clone for faster download: 

  ```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  ```
- Check firewall or proxy settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extraction of Release Archives Errors">
- Check that your archive tool supports `.zip` or `.tar.gz` properly.
- Ensure you have write permissions in the extraction directory.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake FetchContent Issues">
- Confirm you have CMake 3.14 or newer.
- Check that your network allows HTTPS downloads.
- Ensure `gtest_force_shared_crt` is correctly set on Windows if you see linker errors.
</Accordion>
