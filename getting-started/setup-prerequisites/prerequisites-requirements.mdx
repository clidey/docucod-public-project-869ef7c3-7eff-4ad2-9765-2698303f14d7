# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before you begin using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, itâ€™s essential to understand the environments and tools supported, and prepare your system accordingly. This page details the supported platforms, compilers, and dependencies you need to install to ensure smooth operation and integration.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock officially support a broad range of operating systems tailored for C++ development:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (including MSVC-based environments)

<Info>
Support for these platforms ensures compatibility with the latest language standards, debugging tools, and build systems commonly used in professional C++ development.
</Info>

## 2. Compiler Standards and Versions

To build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively, your compiler must support C++11 or later:

- GCC version 4.8 or newer
- Clang version 3.3 or newer
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 (MSVC 14.0) or newer

<Warning>
Older compiler versions may lack support for necessary C++11 constructs and cause compilation errors.
</Warning>

## 3. Required Tools and Dependencies

### Build Tools

Your environment must have one or more of the following build tools installed and configured:

- **Bazel**: strongly recommended for seamless integration
- **CMake**: supported for users preferring traditional build processes
- **GNU Make** or others when integrating manually

### Core Libraries

- Standard C++ libraries compatible with the compiler version
- For GoogleMock features, GoogleTest source is bundled but needs to be included properly

### Optional Tools

- Debugger (e.g., `gdb`, `lldb`, or Visual Studio Debugger) for test failure investigation
- Code coverage tools if you wish to measure test coverage

## 4. Access and Permissions

- Basic user privileges to install and configure the development environment
- File system permissions to add and compile source files
- Network access, if fetching dependencies or updates from remote repositories

## 5. Network and Environment Settings

- No special firewall or port settings required
- If behind restrictive proxies or corporate firewalls, configure build tools accordingly

# Preparing Your Environment: Step-by-Step

Follow these practical instructions to set up prerequisites before installing or building GoogleTest/GoogleMock:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Your Operating System">
Check your OS is listed among supported platforms: Linux, macOS, or Windows.
</Step>
<Step title="Install a Supported Compiler">
- Linux/macOS: Ensure GCC >= 4.8 or Clang >= 3.3 is installed. Use `gcc --version` or `clang --version` to verify.
- Windows: Install Visual Studio 2015 or later.
</Step>
<Step title="Set Up Build System">
- Install Bazel (recommended) from https://bazel.build/
- Alternatively, install CMake and make tools.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Standard C++ Library Availability">
Ensure your compiler's standard C++ library is accessible and compatible with C++11 or newer.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Development Environment for GoogleTest/GoogleMock">
Download or clone the GoogleTest repository from GitHub:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
```

Refer to installation guides on the installation page to continue.
</Step>
</Steps>

# Best Practices and Compatibility Notes

- **Use Recommended Compiler Versions**: Stay with officially supported compiler versions to leverage bug fixes and full C++11/14 compliance.
- **Avoid Modifying Source Internals**: Mock classes generated by `MOCK_METHOD` macros rely on standard C++ features supported across compilers. Avoid hacks that break compilation.
- **Virtual Destructors are Required**: When mocking classes, they must have virtual destructors to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup.

<Tip>
Ensure your test fixtures, mock classes, and abstract interfaces all declare virtual destructors.
</Tip>

- **Name Test Suites and Test Names Carefully**: Avoid underscores `_` at the start or end of test suite and test names to prevent internal compiler or GoogleTest naming conflicts.

# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Setup">
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors During Build">
Check:
- Compiler version meets minimum requirements.
- Your environment variables like `PATH` include compiler binaries.
- Build system configuration matches your OS and compiler.
- For MSVC, remove unnecessary `const` qualifiers on function parameters in mocks to avoid warning C4301/C4373.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing C++11 Features">
- Verify your compiler flag includes `-std=c++11` or better.
- Upgrade compiler if out-of-date.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Verification Fails Unexpectedly">
- Confirm that your mock classes have virtual destructors.
- Use correct `MOCK_METHOD` syntax and qualifiers.
- Avoid interleaving `EXPECT_CALL()` and invocation; set expectations beforehand.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Issues When Fetching Dependencies">
- Configure proxy environment variables if behind corporate firewall.
- Temporarily disable firewalls to test.
</Accordion>
