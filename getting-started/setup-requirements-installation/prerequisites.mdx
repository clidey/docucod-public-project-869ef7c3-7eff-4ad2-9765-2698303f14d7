# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GoogleTest & GoogleMock

This page outlines the minimal system requirements, supported operating systems, compiler versions, dependencies, and policy considerations necessary before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Ensuring these prerequisites are met guarantees a smooth setup and reliable build process.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms & Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are highly portable and support a wide range of platforms. Supported platforms include, but are not limited to:

- Linux (various distributions)
- Windows (e.g., with Visual Studio)
- macOS

Support across other Unix-like systems is generally possible, but community contributions maintain the CMake support.

<Note>
If you encounter platform-specific build issues, check the community support or submit an issue on the GitHub repository.
</Note>

## 2. C++ Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler that supports **C++17** or later.

- Ensure your compiler supports at least C++17. This includes:
  - GCC version 7.0 or higher
  - Clang version 5.0 or higher
  - MSVC with Visual Studio 2017 (15.7) or later

### Configuring C++ Standard

If your build system requires explicit specification of the C++ standard, set the standard accordingly:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Or pass compiler flags manually if not using CMake.

<Warning>
Using compilers lacking C++17 support will result in build failures or undefined behavior.
</Warning>

## 3. Required Software & Build Tools

### CMake

- Minimum required version: **3.13** for GoogleMock build scripts, **3.16** or higher recommended for complete GoogleTest distribution.

- CMake serves to generate native build files and projects across platforms.

- Download CMake from [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/).

### Make or Equivalent

- On Linux and Unix-based systems, GNU Make or alternatives are required.

- On Windows, Visual Studio MSBuild is used with generated project files.

### Compiler Toolchains

- Compatible C++ compilers matching above requirement.

- Thread support (e.g., pthreads) is important and typically required; GoogleTest detects this.

### Optional Tools

- Python may be needed for running some tests or scripts but is not strictly mandatory.

## 4. Dependencies

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock have minimal external dependencies.

- Abseil and RE2 integration is optional and controlled via build flags.

- GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest internally, but the build scripts handle this transparently.

- POSIX thread (pthreads) support is conditionally enabled based on platform detection.

<Info>
If you want to enable advanced string matching features, you may need to install Abseil and RE2 separately and enable the `GTEST_HAS_ABSL` option during build.
</Info>

## 5. System Resources

- Disk Space: Minimal â€” Source code and build files generally require less than 100 MB.

- RAM: Adequate RAM for compiling C++ projects is recommended. Actual usage depends on your project and build parallelism.

- Storage and permissions: You need write permissions in your build and installation directories.

## 6. Network Requirements

- Only required if using build system to fetch GoogleTest sources (e.g., CMake FetchContent).

- Internet access is necessary if your build downloads GoogleTest or GoogleMock during configuration.

## 7. Access and Permissions

- On Unix-based systems, you may require administrative access (`sudo`) to install GoogleTest system-wide (default is `/usr/local`).

- For development-only usage, you can build and use GoogleTest without administrative rights by configuring an out-of-source build in user space.

## 8. Policies on C++ Standard Support

The GoogleTest project maintains support for the C++ standards as follows:

- Actively supports C++17 environments.
- Future releases may deprecate older standards and enable more modern features.

Ensure your toolchain complies with these requirements to avoid compatibility issues.

## 9. Summary Checklist

Before proceeding with installation, verify the following:

- [ ] Platform is supported (Linux, Windows, macOS, or compatible POSIX system).
- [ ] Compiler supports at least C++17.
- [ ] CMake version 3.13 or higher is installed.
- [ ] Build tools like Make, MSBuild, or Ninja are available.
- [ ] Pthread support on Unix platforms is functioning or manually configured.
- [ ] Adequate disk space and permissions for build and install.
- [ ] Internet access if using remote source fetching.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<Tip>
If you see errors related to missing pthreads or thread support during build, verify the `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro is set correctly. You may need to specify `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if thread support is present but not automatically detected.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not attempt to build GoogleTest with compilers that do not fully support C++17. Although some builds may appear to succeed, runtime errors or subtle bugs can occur.
</Warning>

<Note>
If your project uses an older compiler, consider upgrading or using a compatible container or VM environment that meets these prerequisites.
