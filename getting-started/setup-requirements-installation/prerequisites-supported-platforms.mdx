# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Prepare your development environment effectively by understanding the compilers, operating systems, and C++ standards required to build and run GoogleTest successfully. This guide ensures you have the needed tools and compatible environment to avoid common setup pitfalls.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest runs on a broad range of operating systems, thanks to its extensive portability support. Officially supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (desktop, including MinGW and Visual Studio environments)
- **macOS**
- **Cygwin and MinGW** environments on Windows

Additionally, GoogleTest supports several Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, and embedded OS variants with varying degrees of support.


<Tip>
For embedded or less common platforms, verify compatibility as some features might be limited or require manual tweaks.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Compilers and C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires a compiler with complete support for **C++17** or a later standard. This ensures access to modern language features essential for GoogleTest's implementation and your tests.

### Supported Compilers:

- **GCC** version 7.0 or later
- **Clang** version 3.4.1 or later
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** starting from Visual Studio 2015 (version 14.0)+
- **Intel LLVM Compiler** (compatible versions)

> Note: MSVC compilers earlier than Visual Studio 2015 are not supported and will result in build errors.


### C++ Standard Enforcement

When configuring your build system (e.g., CMake), you must explicitly set the C++ standard to at least C++17:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Alternatively, provide the appropriate standard flags if your build system does not support these directives directly.


## 3. Multi-Threading Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe when integrated with platforms that support the POSIX pthreads library. It automatically detects pthreads availability for enabling concurrency features like parallel test execution.

### Platforms with pthread Support Enabled by Default:

- Linux and most Unix-like platforms
- macOS
- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD

### Windows and Others

Windows platforms use native threading facilities instead of pthreads. MinGW does **not** support pthreads fully and uses Windows threading primitives.

If automatic detection fails, you can manually control pthread support with compile-time flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1   # force enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0   # force disable
```


## 4. Platform-Dependent Features and Limitations

Certain features have platform-specific behaviors or availability:

- **Death Tests:** Supported on most desktop OSes with a file system (Linux, macOS, Windows desktops).
- **Stream Redirection:** Not supported on embedded platforms or mobile Windows variants.
- **RTTI and Exceptions:** Availability depends on compiler and build flags; GoogleTest requires RTTI for full functionality and supports exception-enabled builds.


## 5. Visual Studio Specific Notes

- Minimum Visual Studio version supported is 2015.
- By default, GoogleTest links against the static CRT. To avoid runtime conflicts, you may enable dynamic CRT linkage using the CMake option:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

This ensures your test binaries and GoogleTest use consistent runtime libraries.


## 6. Build System Compatibility

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with most build systems, but the recommended approach is using **CMake** (minimum version 3.14) for cross-platform compatibility.

### CMake Integration Tips:

- Use `FetchContent` to automatically download and integrate GoogleTest.
- Use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` if GoogleTest is pre-installed on your system.


## 7. Summary Checklist Before Building GoogleTest

<Steps>
<Step title="Operating System Compatibility">
Verify your development machine runs a supported OS such as Linux, Windows (desktop), or macOS.
</Step>
<Step title="Compiler Supports C++17">
Ensure you have a compiler version supporting C++17:
- GCC >= 7.0
- Clang >= 3.4.1
- MSVC (Visual Studio) >= 2015
</Step>
<Step title="Threading Library Availability">
Confirm that pthreads is available on Unix-like systems or that Windows threading support is functional.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Build System">
Set C++ standard explicitly in your build configuration. For CMake, set:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Visual Studio Runtime">
For Visual Studio users, decide between static or dynamic runtime linkage and configure `gtest_force_shared_crt` accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 8. Troubleshooting Platform Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors About C++ Versions">
If you see errors stating C++ standards less than 17 are not supported, verify compiler version and your build system's C++ standard flag settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Failure Due to Missing pthreads">
On some Unix-like systems, pthreads might not be detected automatically. You can force detection with:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

Or disable on unsupported platforms with:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows Related to Runtime Libraries">
Mismatch between static and dynamic CRT linkage is a common cause. Use the CMake flag `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` or ensure your project settings and GoogleTest build settings match.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Platform or Embedded System">
GoogleTest may work with manual porting, but automatic detection for some features could fail or be disabled. Review platform limitations and consider custom configurations.
</Accordion>

## Quick Reference Sample: Minimal CMakeLists.txt for GoogleTest

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject CXX)

# Enable C++17
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Download and add GoogleTest
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_test COMMAND my_test)
```

This ensures building and linking against GoogleTest with proper standards and platform support.
