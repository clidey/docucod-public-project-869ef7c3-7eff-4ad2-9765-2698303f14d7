# Quick Validation and Troubleshooting

This guide helps you confirm your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup is working correctly by running a simple example test suite. It also walks through common integration issues such as linker errors, misconfigurations, and incompatible toolchains, pointing to diagnostic outputs and practical resolution steps.

---

## 1. Confirming a Successful Setup

The quickest way to verify if your GoogleTest environment is properly installed and integrated is to build and run a sample test suite.

### Step 1: Write a Simple Test
Create a file named `sample_test.cpp` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Expect two strings to be equal.
  EXPECT_STREQ("hello", "hello");
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This minimal test verifies the basic functioning of GoogleTest.

### Step 2: Build the Test
Depending on your build system and platform, compile the test as follows:

**Using g++ command line:**

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include \
    -pthread sample_test.cpp /path/to/libgtest.a -o sample_test
```

Replace `/path/to/googletest/include` and `/path/to/libgtest.a` with the actual paths where GoogleTest was installed or built.

**Using CMake:**

- Ensure your `CMakeLists.txt` includes GoogleTest as per installation docs.
- Configure and build with `cmake` and `make`.

### Step 3: Run the Test

Execute:

```bash
./sample_test
```

**Expected output:**

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms the framework is correctly installed and runnable.

## 2. Common Early Integration Issues

Integration issues often manifest as linker errors, misconfigurations, or failures caused by incompatible compiler or build toolchain versions.

### 2.1 Linker Errors

Typical errors include:

- `undefined reference to` symbols from GoogleTest or GoogleMock
- Multiple definition errors

**Causes and Solutions:**

- **GoogleTest/GoogleMock library not linked correctly:**
  - Ensure `-lgtest -lgmock` or the full static libraries `libgtest.a` and `libgmock.a` are included in the linker command.
  - If using CMake, verify `target_link_libraries(target gtest gmock)` is added.

- **Order of linking:**
  - Library order can matter; link GoogleTest libraries _after_ your source/object files.

- **Multiple conflicting versions:**
  - Remove duplicate or old installations.
  - Clean build directories and rebuild.

### 2.2 Misconfiguration

Some build settings affecting GoogleTest include:

- **C++ standard version:**
  - GoogleTest requires at least C++17 support. Use `-std=c++17` or later.

- **Threading:**
  - GoogleTest uses POSIX threads on Linux/macOS and supported Windows APIs. Ensure `-pthread` or appropriate threading flags are used.

- **Macro definitions:**
  - Avoid conflicting macros that may alter GoogleTest behavior unintentionally.

- **Include paths:**
  - Verify your include path points to the correct GoogleTest install location.

### 2.3 Toolchain Incompatibility

- Confirm your compiler version supports C++17.
- Use supported versions of CMake, Bazel, or other build tools.
- Check platform compatibility, especially on less common OSes.

## 3. Diagnosing Failures

When the test suite fails to compile or run, use the following steps:

### 3.1 Review Compiler and Linker Output

Carefully inspect errors for missing symbols or file not found messages.

### 3.2 Enable Verbose Logging

You can run tests with increased verbosity to get detailed diagnostic output:

```bash
./sample_test --gtest_verbose=info
```

For GoogleMock, use:

```bash
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=info
```

Verbose logging helps detect unexpected calls and unmet expectations.

### 3.3 Check GoogleTest Version

A version mismatch between your installed GoogleTest headers and libraries can cause obscure issues.

- Verify you are compiling against the same version as linked.

### 3.4 Clean and Rebuild

Remove all cached builds and generated files and rebuild from scratch.

---

## 4. Resolution Workflows

Follow these targeted workflows to resolve common issues:

### 4.1 Fixing Linker Issues

1. Confirm that GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries are built:

```bash
cd /path/to/googletest
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

2. Add the resulting static libraries (`libgtest.a`, `libgmock.a`) to your link command.
3. In CMake, include GoogleTest via `add_subdirectory()` and link with `target_link_libraries()`.
4. Verify order: your objects first, then libraries.

### 4.2 Adjust Compiler Settings

- Add `-std=c++17`.
- Add `-pthread` on POSIX systems.

### 4.3 Address Incompatible Toolchains

- Update compiler and build tools to compatible versions detailed in [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup/prerequisites).

### 4.4 Suppress Uninteresting Call Warnings

If you see `Uninteresting mock function call` warnings but they are benign:

- Use `NiceMock<T>` for mocks to suppress these warnings.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
```

- Or specify catch-all expectations:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, SomeMethod(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

---

## 5. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Always define virtual destructors in interfaces you mock.
- Set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) before exercising the mock objects.
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors without setting expectations.
- Run your tests with the `--gmock_verbose` flag to diagnose mock call mismatches.
- For complex errors, refer to the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/docs/gmock_faq.html).

## 6. Getting Help and Next Steps

- For detailed usage, refer to the [Quickstart Workflow](/overview/features-workflows/quickstart-workflow) to learn how to write and run tested mocks.
- Consult the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for advanced mocking usage.
- Visit the [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html) for API details.
- Explore the [Troubleshooting & Performance FAQ](/faq/troubleshooting-optimization/test-failure-diagnostics) for diverse failure cases.

<Tip>
If stuck, verifying expectations early using `testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object)` can help detect unmet expectations before object destruction.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Keep your mock objects' lifetimes clear. If a mock object is leaked, verification may not occur, causing silent test passes.
</Tip>
