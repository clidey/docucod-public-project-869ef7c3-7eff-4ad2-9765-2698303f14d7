# Quick Validation & Sample Projects

This page guides you through the simple steps to verify your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation by running the provided sample tests. This validation confirms that your setup is working correctly and introduces you to the location and purpose of sample test files included in the source.

---

## 1. Locate Sample Tests

GoogleTest includes sample test files to help you verify that the framework works in your environment. These samples cover foundational use cases like simple unit tests and mocking behavior.

- The primary sample test source files are located in the `googletest/samples/` directory within your cloned or installed GoogleTest repository.
- Common files include:
  - `sample1_unittest.cc`
  - `sample5_unittest.cc`
  - Additional samples showcasing typed tests, parameterized tests, and mocks.

These files contain runnable tests demonstrating core GoogleTest and GoogleMock features.

## 2. Build and Link Sample Projects

### Using CMake

If you built GoogleTest with CMake as a standalone project or as part of a larger project, use your existing build setup to compile the samples:

```bash
cd googletest
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This builds the test libraries and typically sample executables.

### Using Bazel

If using Bazel, build sample targets as defined in the workspace. For example:

```bash
bazel test //googletest/samples:sample1_unittest
```

### Manual Compilation

You can also manually compile samples by linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries:

```bash
c++ -std=c++17 -isystem <path_to_googletest>/googletest/include \
    -pthread sample1_unittest.cc \
    <built_gtest_libs> -o sample1_test
```

Replace `<path_to_googletest>` and `<built_gtest_libs>` accordingly.

## 3. Run Sample Tests

Once built, run the sample test executable. For example:

```bash
./sample1_test
```

### Expected Output

- The run should report all tests passing or indicate the number of tests executed.
- Sample output snippet:

```
[==========] Running 4 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 4 tests from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesThis
[       OK ] SampleTest.DoesThis (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesThat
[       OK ] SampleTest.DoesThat (1 ms)
[----------] 4 tests from SampleTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 4 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 4 tests.
```

If your tests pass, your GoogleTest setup is correctly installed and working.

## 4. Understanding the Samples

These sample tests cover common scenarios:

- **Simple test assertions** to verify expected behaviors using `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*` macros.
- **Test fixtures** that demonstrate sharing setup and teardown logic for multiple tests.
- **Mock objects** illustrating how to use GoogleMock to simulate dependencies.
- **Typed and parameterized tests** showing how to run tests with varying data or types.

Review these samples to understand how to structure your tests and apply GoogleTest features.

## 5. Troubleshooting Failed Tests

### Common Issues

- **Build Failures:** Ensure you compiled samples with the correct C++ standard (C++17 or higher) and linked to GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- **Runtime Failures:** Test output will include detailed failure messages. Check if libraries mismatch or environment variables affect execution.
- **Test Discovery Problems:** Verify that the test executable runs without filters that exclude all tests (`--gtest_filter`).

### Diagnostic Steps

- Confirm your environment meets [system requirements](../set-up-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.md).
- Rebuild samples ensuring no build warnings or errors.
- Run tests with verbose output: `./sample1_test --gtest_verbose=1` for more details.

### Ask for Help

If problems persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Errors](../troubleshooting-common-issues/troubleshooting-setup-errors.md) guide or reach out to community resources as described in [Getting Help & Community Resources](../troubleshooting-common-issues/getting-help-community.md).

## Additional Tips

- Run samples first before integrating GoogleTest into your own projects.
- Use samples as templates for your tests to get familiar with API usage.
- Explore the [Writing and Running Your First Test](../configuration-first-run-validation/first-test.md) page next for guidance on authoring your own tests.
