# Validating Your Setup

This guide helps you quickly verify that your GoogleTest installation is correctly set up by running simple diagnostic tests and understanding expected outputs. It also provides troubleshooting tips focused on common misconfigurations and offers guidance on verifying compatibility with your toolchain.

---

## 1. Why Validate Your Setup?

After installing GoogleTest, it is crucial to confirm that everything works as expected before writing your tests. This prevents wasted time debugging environment problems later, and ensures your test framework will handle assertions, test discovery, and execution reliably.

Common issues caught early include:
- Improper linkage or missing libraries
- Compiler incompatibility
- Runtime errors due to mismatched runtime or threading support

Validating your setup early will accelerate development and testing confidence.

---

## 2. Running a Basic Diagnostic Test

### Step 1: Write a Minimal Test

Create a minimal test file named `validate_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test case that always passes.
TEST(ValidateSetup, BasicTruth) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

### Step 2: Compile the Test

Compile your test using your standard build system or command line. Here's an example using g++ and CMake configurations that link GoogleTest properly:

```bash
# Using g++ (adjust paths and flags as needed)
g++ -std=c++17 validate_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o validate_test
```

**Tip:** Use `-std=c++17` or higher since GoogleTest requires C++17 or later.


### Step 3: Run the Test Binary

Execute the test binary:

```bash
./validate_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```shell
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from ValidateSetup
[ RUN      ] ValidateSetup.BasicTruth
[       OK ] ValidateSetup.BasicTruth (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from ValidateSetup (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This output indicates GoogleTest is correctly installed and operational.

## 3. Checking GoogleMock Integration

To verify GoogleMock works alongside GoogleTest, write a simple mock test:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::Return;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), ());
};

TEST(ValidateMock, ReturnsExpectedValue) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(), 42);
}
```

Build and run this test similar to the previous example. Successful execution confirms GoogleMock is integrated correctly.

---

## 4. Understanding Common Outputs

When running tests, GoogleTest with GoogleMock produces clear, structured output such as:

- `[ RUN      ]`: Marks the start of a test.
- `[       OK ]`: Indicates the test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ]`: Indicates failure with detailed messages.

Warnings from GoogleMock such as "Uninteresting mock function call" occur when a mock method is called without matching expectations. These warnings are safe to ignore unless they indicate unintended calls. Adjust verbosity with `--gmock_verbose` flag if needed.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Checkpoints

### Problem: Test binary fails to compile or link

- Verify that the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are correctly linked.
- Confirm you are using a compatible C++ compiler version supporting C++17.
- Make sure to include `-pthread` (or platform equivalent) for threading support.

### Problem: Tests compile but fail unexpectedly

- Ensure no multiple or conflicting GoogleTest versions exist.
- Check for mismatched runtime libraries between your build and GoogleTest binaries.
- Verify that all mock expectations are correctly specified and all mock objects are properly destroyed.

### Problem: Mock warnings on uninteresting calls

- These warnings occur when a mock method is called without an `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL`.
- Suppress by using `NiceMock`, or by adding `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- Avoid suppressing by ignoring or suppressing warnings without understanding the cause.

### Problem: Leaked mock objects detected

- GoogleMock detects mocks not deleted at program exit.
- Make sure all mocks have deterministic lifetimes and are deleted appropriately.
- Use `testing::Mock::AllowLeak(mock_object)` cautiously to suppress leaks when intentional (e.g., for long-running mocks).

---

## 6. Verifying Toolchain Compatibility

GoogleTest auto-detects supported platforms and adjusts features accordingly. To explicitly verify:

- Confirm your compiler supports exceptions, RTTI, threading, and filesystem features.
- GoogleTest documentation recommends GCC, Clang, or MSVC with C++17.
- Run the diagnostic tests above on target platforms to verify expected behavior.

See the [Supported Platforms & Ecosystem](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/overview/introduction-and-value/supported-platforms-and-ecosystem.md) for more details.

## 7. Summary Checklist for Setup Validation

- [x] Compile at least one basic `EXPECT_TRUE(true)` test successfully.
- [x] Link with GoogleTest and GoogleMock without errors.
- [x] Run the test binary and observe at least one passing test.
- [x] Run a mock method test with `EXPECT_CALL` and verify correct mock behavior.
- [x] Confirm no unexpected warnings or errors in test output.
- [x] If you receive warnings, diagnose example calls, adjust expectations or mock policies.

---

## 8. Next Steps

Once your validation tests succeed:

- Proceed to write your first detailed test using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. See [Writing Your First Test](../initial-setup-usage/writing-your-first-test.md).
- Configure your project fully following the instructions at [Project Configuration](../initial-setup-usage/project-configuration.md).
- Explore Continuous Integration integration scenarios detailed in [Integration Story](../../getting-started-and-integration/integration-story.md).
- Consult troubleshooting resources if encountering further issues in [Common Troubleshooting](../../troubleshooting-support/common-troubleshooting.md).

<Tip>
Regularly validating your setup as you configure new environments or platforms saves time and reduces frustration by catching issues early.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleMock warnings on uninteresting calls indicate no explicit expectation; this is not necessarily a test failure but often a sign to review test coverage.
</Note>

<Warning>
Leaked mock objects mean expectations aren't verified - ensure proper deletion or use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional.
</Warning>
