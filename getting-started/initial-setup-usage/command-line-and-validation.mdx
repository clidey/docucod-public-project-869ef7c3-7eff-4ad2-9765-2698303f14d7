# Running Tests & Validating Your Setup

Learn how to invoke your tests from the command line, interpret test output, and validate your setup is correct. This guide provides you with actionable steps to run your compiled GoogleTest tests, understand the console results, and confirm that your environment is properly configured.

---

## 1. Invoking Your Tests from the Command Line

Once your test executable is built (usually by linking to `gtest_main` or providing your own `main()`), you can run it directly from a command prompt or terminal.

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate Your Test Executable">
Your compiled test binary is typically located in your build output directory. Example names might include `my_tests`, `runTests.exe`, or similar.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Executable">
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the test executable by typing its path:

```bash
./my_tests  # Linux/macOS
my_tests.exe  # Windows
```
</Step>
<Step title="Pass Optional Flags">
GoogleTest supports a variety of command line flags (prefixed by `--gtest_`) for controlling test execution.

Example:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*  # Run only tests in the FactorialTest suite
```

You can list all supported flags by running your test executable with `--help`.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You usually don't need to specify all tests manually. GoogleTest auto-discovers and registers all tests linked into your executable.
</Tip>

## 2. Interpreting Test Output

When you run your tests, GoogleTest prints structured output describing each test run, including passing and failing tests.

### Output Format Highlights

- `[ RUN      ] TestSuiteName.TestName`: Test start notification.
- `[       OK ] TestSuiteName.TestName (time ms)`: Test passed along with execution time.
- `[  FAILED  ] TestSuiteName.TestName (time ms)`: Test failed, including key failure reasons.
- `[  SKIPPED ] TestSuiteName.TestName`: Test was skipped.

### Example Output

```text
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
/path/to/test.cc:25: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(2)
    Which is: 1
  2
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

<Tip>
If the output is not colored, you can use the `--gtest_color=yes` flag to enable colors for better readability where supported.
</Tip>

## 3. Validating Your Setup

After running your tests, you want to ensure that your GoogleTest setup is correct and reliable.

### Quick Checks

- **All tests run:** Verify that the number of tests run matches what you expect.
- **No unexpected failures:** Any failures should be intentional or understood.
- **No tests skipped inadvertently:** Check if there are unexpected skipped tests.

### Flags for Verification

- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to see all discovered tests without running them:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
```

- Use `--gtest_filter="PositiveFilter*-NegativeFilter*"` to run or exclude specific tests.
- Use `--gtest_brief` to print failures only, omitting passes for quicker scanning.

<Tip>
If no tests run, confirm your build links correctly to GoogleTest test suites and that your tests are not disabled or filtered out.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Understanding the Exit Code

Your test executable returns exit code `0` on success (all tests pass), and non-zero (typically `1`) if any tests fail. This is important for CI systems or build scripts that rely on exit codes.

### Best Practice

Always check the exit code in your build or CI system to detect test failures.

Example in bash:

```bash
./my_tests
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed!"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

## 5. Common Shortcuts to Verify Setup

- **Run tests with minimal output:**

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_brief
```

- **Repeat tests multiple times to catch flaky tests:**

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_repeat=10
```

- **Run a single test:**

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest
```

- **Show all discovered tests:**

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No Tests Are Found or Executed">

- Ensure your test executable links against `gtest_main` or provides a valid `main()` with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Verify that your test source files are compiled and linked.
- Check filters (`--gtest_filter`) are not excluding all tests.
- Disabled tests matching `DISABLED_` prefix run only if `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` is set.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Test Failures">

- Review assertion failure messages carefully for clues.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to trigger debugger breaks on failures.
- Run failing tests in isolation with `--gtest_filter=TestSuite.TestName`.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output Lacks Color or Formatting">

- Confirm your terminal supports colors.
- Use `--gtest_color=yes` to force-enable colored output.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Exit Code Is Always Zero Even on Failures">

- Check that your `main()` returns the value from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- If manually writing `main()`, ensure `return RUN_ALL_TESTS();` is present.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Running tests in GoogleTest involves executing your test binaries, optionally passing flags to control which tests run and how results are displayed. Examining the results and exit codes enables you to confirm correct integration. Frequently used flags to streamline verification include test listing, filtering, and repeated execution to catch flaky tests. When issues arise, test isolation, appropriate fixture usage, and flag configuration are key focus areas for troubleshooting.
