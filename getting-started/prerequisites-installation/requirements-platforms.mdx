# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Ensure your environment meets GoogleTest's essential system, compiler, and platform requirements to guarantee smooth installation and operation. This page helps you quickly verify compatibility and avoid common issues arising from unsupported setups.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standard and Compiler Versions

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ environment with the following minimum standards and compilers:

- **C++17 Standard:** GoogleTest mandates support for C++17 or later. Ensure your compiler is configured to compile with the `-std=c++17` flag or an equivalent.

- **Compiler Support:**

  - GCC 7.0 or newer
  - Clang 6.0 or newer
  - MSVC Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) or newer
  - Apple Clang Xcode 10.0 or newer

> <Note>Please confirm your compiler version supports C++17. Attempting to compile GoogleTest with earlier standards results in errors.</Note>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest is tested and maintained for broad platform compatibility, including:

- **Linux:** Supported on most modern distributions.
- **Windows:** Desktop versions using Visual Studio 2017 or later.
- **macOS:** macOS Catalina (10.15) and newer.
- **Other Unix-like OS:** BSD variants, Solaris, AIX, and others have partial support and may require additional configuration.

Certain embedded and mobile platforms (Windows Mobile, Windows RT, some embedded Linux variants) are not officially supported.

### Platform-Specific Notes

- GoogleTest requirements align with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).
- For detailed platform compatibility and supported compiler versions, refer to the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## 3. Build Environment & Build Tools

- **CMake:** Version 3.14 or newer is recommended, as it supports convenient build features required by GoogleTest.
- **Make/Build tools:** Compatible with native build tools on the supported platforms, such as GNU Make, Ninja, or MSBuild.

## 4. Compiler and Platform Feature Detection

GoogleTest internally checks and adapts based on environment features, including:

- POSIX compliance and availability of pthreads for thread safety.
- Presence of exceptions and RTTI support.
- Availability of platform-specific features like SEH on Windows.

If your environment lacks some features (e.g., pthreads), GoogleTest will either adapt or require manual override through macros.

## 5. Minimum Compiler Version Checks

- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2015 or later is required for GoogleMock, a component included by default with GoogleTest. Older versions will trigger a compilation error.

- **GCC & Clang:** Versions older than GCC 7 or equivalent Clang versions may fail due to lacking C++17 support.

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Failure to Compile Due to C++ Standard:** If your build fails citing missing C++17 support, verify your build system sets `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

- **Threading Support Issues:** On platforms without `pthread` support, multi-threaded tests wonâ€™t work correctly. You can enable or disable pthread usage via compile flags (`-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`).

- **Linking Errors on Windows:** For Visual Studio builds, mismatched runtime libraries between your project and GoogleTest can cause linker errors. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to unify runtime linkage.

- **Shared Library Complications:** If you build GoogleTest or GoogleMock as shared libraries, ensure you add the necessary compiler and linker flags like `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

<Tip>
Always check your compiler version and ensure it is configured to use C++17 before attempting to build. This prevents the most common source of build failures.

<Tip>
Refer to the [System Architecture Overview](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/overview/architecture-core-concepts/arch-mermaid) page to understand how platform and environment support impacts GoogleTest's components.
</Tip>

## 7. Customization and Overrides

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide customization points to accommodate particular environments or compilers. Examples include:

- Defining macros through compiler flags to override default feature detection.
- Custom implementations of threading, environment variables, or logging.

See the customization documentation in [gtest-port.h](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) and [gmock-port.h](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/include/gmock/internal/gmock-port.h) for more details.

## Summary

This page outlines the essential system, compiler, platform, and C++ features required by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Verifying these requirements before building will ensure a smooth setup and avoid common errors.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Supporting C++17">
Verify your compiler flags explicitly enable C++17. For example, add `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or select C++17 in MSVC project properties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Related to Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows">
Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to ensure all parts of your build use the same runtime linkage to fix runtime library mismatch errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread Library Not Found or Link Errors on Unix/Linux">
Ensure your build system links against pthread. When using custom build scripts, add `-pthread` to compile and link flags.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Platform or Embedded Environment Unsupported">
Some embedded or mobile platforms may lack required system features. Consider disabling features via macros or using compatible alternatives.

# Appendix: GoogleTest Platform Macro Detection

GoogleTest auto-detects platforms and sets internal macros such as:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` for Windows desktop
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX` for Linux
- `GTEST_OS_MAC` for macOS

These macros drive platform-specific compilation and feature enablement.
