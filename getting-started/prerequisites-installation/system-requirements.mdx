# System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following essential system requirements before building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock (gMock). Proper setup guarantees a smooth experience across supported platforms.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are cross-platform and support an extensive range of environments. Supported OS families include:

- **Linux** (including common distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop and MinGW flavors)
- **Mac OS X**
- Other UNIX-like systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and AIX

While some niche platforms are detected, the core support is strongest for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

> GoogleTest automatically detects the platform at compile time. Implementations on embedded and mobile platforms are limited or unavailable.


## 2. Compiler Requirements

### Minimum Compiler Versions

The build system and codebase strictly require **C++17** or newer. Verify your compiler supports this standard to avoid build failures.

Supported compilers and minimal versions include:

| Compiler                  | Minimum Version          | Notes                                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GCC                       | 7.0+                    | Full C++17 support required                |
| Clang                     | 5.0+                    | Full C++17 support required                |
| Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)| Visual Studio 2017 (v15) | At least MSVC 2015 Update 3 (_MSC_VER >= 1911) with C++17 enables|


### C++ Language Standard Enforcement

The build system enforces compilation with at least C++17 via compiler flags. For example, when using CMake, specify:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

or pass appropriate flags manually:

```shell
-std=c++17
```

GoogleTest will **not** build or function with earlier standards due to usage of modern language features.


## 3. Required Build Tools

To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock, the following tools are recommended or required:

- **CMake** (version 3.14 or later recommended) for cross-platform build generation.
- Platform-specific compilers supporting C++17 as listed above.
- On Linux and UNIX-like platforms, a typical build toolchain including `make`.
- On Windows, Visual Studio 2017 or above with C++17 support enabled.


### Additional Notes:

- Building GoogleMock requires GoogleTest; they are integrated in the same build.
- When compiling with MSVC, make sure to use the compiler version that supports structured exception handling and required C++17 features.


## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

- Visual C++ 2015 or newer is mandatory.
- Pay special attention to runtime linkage (static/dynamic). The build option `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake controls static/dynamic CRT linkage.

### Linux & Mac

- GCC and Clang both support GoogleTest builds with proper C++17 flags.
- When using pthreads, ensure linking with `-pthread` to avoid linker errors.

### Embedded and Mobile Platforms

- GoogleTest support on embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, or NRF52 is limited and requires custom integration.


## 5. Common Build Flags and Macros

Several macros can be set to tweak GoogleTest and GoogleMock behavior:

- `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` to force pthread support on/off.
- `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to build as shared library.
- `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when linking tests with shared GoogleTest libraries.
- `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` and similar macros to avoid macro clashes.

A comprehensive list of platform macros and feature toggles is maintained in `gtest-port.h` and `gmock-port.h`.


## 6. Verification Checklist

After setting up your system:

1. Verify your compiler supports C++17 by checking its version and attempting a small C++17 code snippet.
2. Confirm CMake (if used) is version 3.14 or newer.
3. Ensure all build tools like `make` or VS build tools are installed.
4. Run a dry build of GoogleTest to verify that compilation proceeds without errors.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common System Issues

- **Compiler version too low:** Upgrade your compiler to a version supporting C++17.

- **Missing pthread support:** On Linux/macOS, ensure development headers and libraries (e.g., libpthread) are installed and your build links with pthread.

- **Build failures on Windows:** Confirm Visual Studio is at least 2017 and you have correctly set the runtime linkage.

- **CMake version outdated:** Upgrade CMake to a supported version to avoid generator issues.

<Check>
Confirm your system meets the following before proceeding:
- Supported OS: Linux, Windows, or Mac OS
- Compiler with full C++17 support (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- CMake 3.14+ (recommended)
- Threading support as needed (pthread on Unix-like systems)
- Proper linkage of runtimes and threading libraries
</Check>
