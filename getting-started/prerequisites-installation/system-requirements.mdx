# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment is fully compatible before proceeding to install and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page details the supported operating systems, compiler and toolchain versions, and C++ standard requirements necessary to build and run these frameworks successfully.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have been rigorously tested and are officially supported on the following platforms:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions, including MSVC and MinGW builds)
- **macOS**

Additionally, support extends to a variety of UNIX-like and BSD systems, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and more, though these might see less frequent testing.

### Detailed Platform Details

| Platform            | Notes                                                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux               | Full support, including Android (API level 9 or higher)           |
| Windows Desktop     | Supported with MSVC 2017 Update 3 (and later) and MinGW           |
| macOS               | Fully supported with Apple toolchains                             |
| BSD Variants        | Support available but testing is less frequent                    |
| Embedded/Mobile     | Limited or no support (e.g., Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, RT)   |


## Compiler and Toolchain Requirements

### Minimum C++ Compiler Versions

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a modern C++17 compatible compiler. Confirm your toolchain version meets or exceeds the following:

- **GCC:** Version 7.0 or later
- **Clang:** Version 3.4 or later
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (v19.11) or later

> <Tip> Make sure your compilerâ€™s C++ standard mode is set to C++17 or above. Setting this explicitly during build helps avoid compatibility issues. </Tip>

### C++ Standard

Your build environment must support at least **C++17**. GoogleTest verifies this requirement at compile time:

```cpp
#if !defined(__cplusplus) || __cplusplus < 201703L
#error "C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported."
#endif
```

If your project is using CMake, set this requirement with:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Or pass appropriate flags to your compiler if not using CMake.

### Threading Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe on systems where pthreads are available. If your environment does not support pthreads, or automatic detection fails, you may need to manually enable or disable pthread usage by setting the macro `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`:

- Enable pthread support explicitly:

  ```
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
  ```

- Disable pthread support explicitly:

  ```
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
  ```

If your build system uses CMake targets, linking with pthreads is usually handled automatically.

### Exception and RTTI Support

GoogleTest checks for the availability of exceptions and RTTI (Run-Time Type Information). While exceptions are optional, some features or user code may rely on them.

Recommended to compile with exceptions enabled. RTTI usage depends on your compiler and build flags but is detected automatically.

---

## File System and Stream Redirection

GoogleTest requires file system support and the ability to redirect streams for some advanced features like death tests and output verification.

- Most desktop and server OSes provide the required file system support.
- On embedded or mobile platforms (e.g., Windows Mobile, some RT environments), these features may be limited.

If file system features are missing, certain GoogleTest features will be disabled.

---

## Operating System Macros Used Internally

GoogleTest automatically defines macros indicating the detected operating system, such as:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`
- `GTEST_OS_MAC`

Users generally do not need to set these manually but can rely on them for conditional compilation.

---

## Practical Tips for Environment Preparation

- **Verify your compiler version:** Run `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or check Visual Studio version before building.
- **Ensure your build flags enable C++17:** Explicitly set your compiler to `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
- **Use CMake for easy environment checks:** GoogleTest's CMake scripts handle many compatibility issues automatically.
- **Check pthreads availability:** On Linux/macOS, pthreads is generally available; Windows uses native threading support.
- **On Windows:** Pay attention to whether you need dynamic (DLL) or static runtime linkage and set `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake if needed.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Using an older compiler version without C++17 support causes immediate compilation failure.
- Not setting the C++ standard mode explicitly, leading to subtle build errors.
- Missing pthreads support or wrong `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` setting causes linking or runtime threading issues.
- Building on unsupported or exotic platforms may disable some features (e.g., death tests).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Requirements Issues">
<Accordion title="C++17 Compliance Error">
If you see a compile-time error about unsupported C++ versions, verify your compiler and build flags support C++17.

- Confirm compiler version.
- Set `-std=c++17` or equivalent in your build.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread Not Detected">
If you encounter linker errors related to pthread functions or thread safety issues:

- Verify pthreads is installed.
- Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to force enable.
- Link with pthreads (`-lpthread`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Platform Features">
Features like death tests may be disabled if file system or stream redirection support is absent.

- Check platform compatibility.
- Consider alternative testing strategies if platform limitations exist.
</Accordion>
