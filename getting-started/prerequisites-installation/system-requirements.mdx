# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment supports GoogleTest by meeting the following system requirements and dependencies. Proper alignment with these requirements guarantees a smooth build and testing experience.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide range of operating systems to enable cross-platform testing:

- **Linux:** Various distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and others
- **Windows:** Desktop Windows, including MSVC toolchain support; MinGW
- **Mac OS X:** Including support for development with Xcode
- **BSD Variants:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- **Others:** Solaris, AIX, Android, Windows Mobile, embedded platforms like ESP32 and ESP8266

> Note: Some platforms may have limited support or may require additional setup for threading and file system capabilities.

## 2. Compiler and Toolchain Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler capable of supporting modern standards and features:

- Must support **C++17** or later (required for core library functionality).
- Officially tested with:
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) 2017 Update 3 and newer
  - GCC 7.0.0 and later
  - Clang (including Apple Clang) with C++17 support
  - Intel LLVM Compiler supporting C++17
- CMake support is required for build configuration. Minimum recommended version is **CMake 3.13** for building standalone, **3.14+** if you use `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`.

### Compiler Flags Handling

GoogleTest’s build system includes logic to adjust compiler flags depending on:

- Compiler type (MSVC, GCC, Clang, IntelLLVM, etc.)
- Build type (static vs shared libraries)
- Threading model (pthreads detection and flags)

This ensures safer behavior like stricter warnings and correct runtime library linkage.


## 3. Required Dependencies

### Core Dependencies:

- **CMake:** For generating build scripts.
- **Threads library:** Supports pthreads on *nix platforms for thread safety in tests.
  - Disabled on MinGW where pthreads support is partial or unreliable.
- **Python 3:** Required only if building GoogleTest’s own Python-based tests.

### Recommended:

- An environment that supports or has configured thread support improves test stability.
  Adjust the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` manually if required.

## 4. C++ Standard and Toolchain Settings

- GoogleTest **requires C++17**.
- To ensure compatibility, specify in your project's top-level CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- When compiling, GoogleTest configures appropriate compiler flags for exception support, RTTI, warnings, and other platform-specific tweaks.

## 5. Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Windows:**
  - Visual Studio users may encounter runtime library conflicts when linking GoogleTest; use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align runtime linkage.
  - GoogleTest ensures UTF-8 encoding for sources.

- **MinGW:**
  - pthreads support is disabled by default.
  - Ninja builds might incorrectly specify some compiler flags, which GoogleTest corrects internally.

- **Mac OS X:**
  - Xcode project files are generated for easy native building.

- **Embedded Platforms:**
  - Platforms like ESP8266 and ESP32 have limited file system and threading support; some GoogleTest features may be restricted or disabled.

## 6. Threading and Concurrency Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe **if pthreads are available and enabled**.
- Detection of pthreads support happens automatically during build configuration.
- You can override thread support with compiler definitions:

  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to force enable
  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to disable

- Without threading support, GoogleTest implements dummy synchronization primitives, limiting safe concurrent test execution.

## 7. File System and I/O

- GoogleTest requires a functional file system for some test features (such as death tests and output capture).
- Most supported platforms have file system support enabled by default.
- Embedded or restricted platforms might disable these features.

## 8. Recommended Environment Setup

### Using CMake to Build GoogleTest Standalone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

- For building **only GoogleTest** without GoogleMock:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

### Incorporating GoogleTest into Existing Projects

- Use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` if GoogleTest is installed.
- Or, embed GoogleTest sources via `add_subdirectory(googletest)`.
- Make sure your project also meets or enforces the C++17 standard.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- If your compiler fails due to missing C++17 support, upgrade your compiler.
- On Windows, if you encounter runtime library mismatch errors, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt`.
- If tests using threads fail to link, ensure pthread libraries are correctly linked or disable pthread support.
- For cross-compilation environments, review pkg-config usage and sysroot settings to ensure correct include and library paths.
