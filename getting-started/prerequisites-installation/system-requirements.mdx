# System Requirements

GoogleTest requires specific platforms, compilers, and standards to build and function correctly. This document details the minimum system prerequisites, supported operating systems, recommended compilers, and C++ standards required for building GoogleTest from source.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be portable and supports major operating systems. Your development environment should align with one of these supported platforms:

- **Linux** (x86, ARM architectures)
- **Windows** (including Visual Studio environment)
- **macOS**

### Notes:
- MinGW builds are supported but note that pthreads support on MinGW is _not_ available; instead, Windows threading primitives are used.
- Other platforms may work but are not officially supported.

## 2. Minimum Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler that supports the C++17 standard. Below are recommended minimum versions:

| Compiler           | Minimum Version | Notes                               |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| GCC (g++)          | 7.0             | Preferably latest stable           |
| Clang              | 6.0             | Latest is recommended              |
| MSVC               | Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later | Supports full C++17 standard     |
| Intel C++ Compiler  | Version 19 or later | Compatible with C++17 features    |

### Compiler Tips:
- GoogleTest's CMake configuration adjusts compiler flags per compiler to ensure strict warnings and proper runtime linkage.
- On MSVC, the runtime library flags are tuned to prefer static CRT linkage when building static GoogleTest libraries, preventing runtime conflicts.
- Ninja generator with Clang on Windows is handled specifically due to incorrect default flags.

## 3. C++ Standard: C++17

The project requires C++17. Your compiler must be invoked with the appropriate flag to enable this standard:

- GCC/Clang: `-std=c++17`
- MSVC: default in supported versions or `/std:c++17`

GoogleTest enforces this via its CMake build using `target_compile_features(... PUBLIC cxx_std_17)`.

## 4. Required Libraries and Dependencies

- **Threads:** If pthreads are available (Linux, macOS except MinGW on Windows), GoogleTest will use them for thread-related features.
- Otherwise, Windows threading API primitives are utilized.
- No other external dependencies are required.

## 5. Build System Requirements

- CMake >= 3.7 is used to configure the build.
- Ninja, Make, or MSBuild can be used as generators.

## 6. Compiler Settings Recommended by GoogleTest

GoogleTest adjusts compiler flags internally for warnings, exceptions, and runtime mismatch prevention:

- Enables warnings at stricter levels (`-Wall -Wextra` for GCC/Clang, `/W4` for MSVC).
- On MSVC, disables deprecated exception handling flags and ensures UTF-8 source encoding.
- Prevents conflicts by forcing static CRT linkage when building static libraries.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<Tip>
**Issue:** Compilation errors due to missing C++17 support.
- **Solution:** Verify your compiler version meets or exceeds the minimum requirements and that C++17 is enabled explicitly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Issue:** Pthreads not detected or failing on MinGW.
- **Solution:** GoogleTest disables POSIX threads support on MinGW and uses Windows threading.
Ensure your build environment reflects this.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Issue:** Runtime crashes due to mismatched CRT libraries on Windows.
- **Solution:** Build GoogleTest with consistent runtime flags. Prefer static linking of CRT when compiling static libraries by letting CMake handle flags through GoogleTest's internal macros.
</Tip>

## 9. Summary

To successfully build GoogleTest,

- Use a supported platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) with a compatible compiler version.
- Ensure your compiler supports C++17 and configure builds accordingly.
- Use CMake 3.7 or newer for configuration.
- Dependencies are minimal; pthreads support is preferred but optional on Windows.

Follow the official [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) documentation and build instructions for detailed guidance on installation and usage.

## Example: Setting Compiler Flags with CMake 

If you are configuring your own CMake project that depends on GoogleTest, ensure you request C++17:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7)
project(MyProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add GoogleTest and link
add_subdirectory(googletest)
add_executable(my_test test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest_main)
```

## Appendix: Compiler Flags Overview from internal_utils.cmake

The build system internally applies the following checks and flags per compiler:
- **MSVC:** `/W4` warnings, static CRT linkage with `-MT`, UTF-8 source encoding.
- **Clang/IntelLLVM:** `-Wall -Wshadow -Wconversion -Wundef`, options to suppress specific warnings.
- **GCC:** `-Wall -Wshadow -Wundef -Wextra`, with version checks to control error warnings.

The settings are automatically applied by GoogleTest's internal CMake macros.
