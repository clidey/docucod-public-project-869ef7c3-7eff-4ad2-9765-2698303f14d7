# System Requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock

This page details the minimum required C++ standards, supported compilers, platforms, and dependencies necessary for installing and building GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Understanding these system requirements will help you ensure your development environment is compatible and prevent common build or runtime issues.

---

## 1. C++ Standards

- **Minimum C++ Standard:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a compiler and environment supporting **C++17** or later.
- To enforce this in your build, use `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` along with `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)` in your `CMakeLists.txt`.
- If integrating in a C project or other build system, specify the C++17 standard via compiler flags, e.g., using `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

<Note>
Compilers that do not meet C++17 support will result in errors, as features utilized by GoogleTest/Mock depend on this standard.
</Note>


## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest follows the [Google Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), supporting commonly used compilers with native C++17 support.

### Compiler Requirements:

- **Microsoft Visual C++:**
  - Minimum: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSC version 19.11) or later.
  - For GoogleMock specifically, minimum Visual C++ 2015 (version _MSC_VER >= 1900_) is required.
  - Static vs Dynamic CRT linking can cause build errors; GoogleTest has a CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to help align CRT usage.

- **GCC:** Version 7.0 or later is recommended.

- **Clang:** 3.4 or later.

- **IntelLLVM and other supported compilers:** Refer to [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

<Warning>
Ensure your compiler toolchain matches these requirements; older compilers may not build GoogleTest/Mock or may produce runtime errors.
</Warning>

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of platforms, summarized below. For detailed and updated platform support, consult the [Supported Platforms document](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Common Supported Platforms:

- Linux (including Android NDK targeting API 9 or higher)
- Windows Desktop (including MinGW)
- macOS
- BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
- Solaris, AIX, HP-UX

### Platform Notes:

- GoogleTest detects platform specifics automatically and adapts.
- Some embedded or mobile platforms may lack features and have partial support.
- File system and threading support are essential for full GoogleTest functionality.

## 4. Dependencies

### Core Dependencies:

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock have minimal external dependencies but rely on:
  - **Standard C++17 libraries.**
  - **PThreads library:** On non-Windows platforms where multithreaded tests are enabled.
  - **Abseil (optional):** Certain integrations may use Abseil macros, but this is optional.

### Threading Support:

- GoogleTest is thread-safe when the platform supports pthreads.
- To explicitly enable or disable pthread support, use compiler flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable pthread explicitly
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable pthread
```

- If pthread is unavailable or disabled, GoogleTest runs without thread safety.

### Shared Library (DLL) Usage:

- To build as a shared library, define:

```bash
-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

- When linking tests against a shared GoogleTest library, define:

```bash
-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

## 5. Environmental Assumptions and Macros

- GoogleTest auto-detects environment features such as exceptions support, RTTI, file system availability, stream redirection, and OS specifics via predefined macros.
- You can override detection or configure environment assumptions via build flags/macros if necessary (often not required).

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

<Accordion title="Common Pitfall: Incompatible Compiler Version">
  <p>
  Trying to build GoogleMock on MSVC compilers older than Visual Studio 2015 will produce an error:

  <code>#error "At least Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is required to compile Google Mock."</code>

  Ensure your MSVC version meets this minimum requirement.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tip: Ensuring Correct CRT Linking on Windows">
  <p>
  Use the CMake option <code>-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON</code> to align runtime library linkage with your project settings and avoid linker errors.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pitfall: Missing pthread Linker Flags on Linux/macOS">
  <p>
  If you manage builds manually (without CMake), remember to link with pthread (e.g., add <code>-pthread</code>) to avoid runtime faults when multithreading is enabled.
  </p>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tip: Using CMake's CXX Standard Enforcement">
  <p>
  Set the following in your top-level CMakeLists to enforce compiler standard compliance:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```
  </p>
</Accordion>

## 7. Verification of System Compatibility

To verify your environment:

1. Run your compiler with `--version` or equivalent to check version.
2. Attempt to configure GoogleTest with CMake; cmake will error if C++17 is unsupported.
3. Confirm pthread library availability where applicable.
