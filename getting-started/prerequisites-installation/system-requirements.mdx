# System Requirements

Review the supported compilers, platforms, and minimum C++ standard requirements to ensure your development environment is ready for GoogleTest. This page covers the essential prerequisites needed before building and using the framework.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of platforms, reflecting its commitment to broad compatibility. Ensure your target development or execution platform is within the supported list to guarantee optimal functionality:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (including MinGW)
- Cygwin
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
- iOS
- Android
- Embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, QNX, Haiku, and others

> The framework automatically detects the platform during compilation. If you are working on a less common or embedded platform, check the official compatibility and consider any known limitations.

## Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler to build successfully:

- **Minimum C++ Standard:** C++17 or later is required. Your build system should specify this explicitly, for example using CMake's `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`.
- Supported compilers include but are not limited to:
  - GCC (version supporting C++17)
  - Clang
  - MS Visual C++ 2015 or later
  - Intel Compiler

> Note that certain features in GoogleTest leverage advanced compiler capabilities such as template support, exception handling, and thread local storage.

### Special Notes on Compiler Features

- GoogleTest detects the availability of exception support and RTTI (run-time type information) and adjusts accordingly. If exceptions or RTTI are disabled in your compiler, verify compatibility.
- Multi-threading support requiring pthreads is automatically detected on supported POSIX systems.
- Windows builds support Structured Exception Handling (SEH).

## Dependencies and Build Tools

To use GoogleTest effectively, ensure the following tools and libraries are present:

- **Build System:** CMake 3.14 or later is recommended, especially for modern features like `FetchContent`.
- **Threading Library:** Pthread library on POSIX platforms. On Windows, native threading APIs are used.
- **Additional Tools:** For cross-platform builds, having the appropriate toolchain for your platform is necessary (e.g., Visual Studio for Windows, GNU toolchains for Linux).

## Environment and System Resources

- Sufficient disk space and memory are required to build GoogleTest and your test projects.
- Network access may be necessary if you use CMake's FetchContent modules to pull dependencies automatically.

## Platform Detection and Tweaks

GoogleTest uses internal macros to identify and adapt to the compilation environment, including OS, threading support, and exception handling capabilities. Occasionally, these may require manual overrides via compiler flags if auto-detection fails.

## Reference to Key Internal Macros

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, etc. indicate platform detection.
- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` controls the availability of POSIX thread support.
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` and `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` indicate support for exceptions and RTTI respectively.

Administrators or build engineers can define these macros explicitly if the auto-detection does not reflect the environment correctly.

## Summary

Ensure your system meets the following before starting to build or use GoogleTest:

- Supported and detected platform
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Required build tools (CMake 3.14+)
- Threading library support where applicable

Confirm these preconditions to avoid build or runtime issues.

## Additional Resources

For more detailed information about installation, configuration, and advanced platform considerations, please consult the following pages:

- [Installation: Linux, macOS, and Windows](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md#build-with-cmake)
- [Project Setup & Configuration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/)
- [Integration & Ecosystem](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/integration.md)

For platform-specific details such as Windows MingW nuances or embedded platforms, also refer to the source header files relevant for environment detection:

- `gtest-port-arch.h`
- `gtest-port.h`

These files contain platform macro definitions and can inform manual configuration adjustments.

<Tip>
If your build environment fails to detect key platform or compiler features properly, manually define the expected macros in your build or compiler settings, as documented in `gtest-port.h`.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Unsupported Compiler Version:** Ensure your compiler supports at least C++17. Older compilers will fail to compile GoogleTest.
- **Missing pthreads on Linux/macOS:** Confirm pthread development libraries are installed and accessible.
- **Windows Build Errors:** Use Visual Studio 2015 or later and ensure build flags are correctly set for the MSVC environment.
- **Platform Detection Failures:** If GoogleTest misdetects OS or features, override relevant macros via compiler definitions.

Use the `-D` option with your compiler or CMake to set these. Example:

```bash
cmake -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1 ..
```

---

## Verification

You can verify if your environment meets these requirements by running the CMake configuration step:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Observe messages regarding platform detection, compiler version, and features. If all checks pass without warnings, your environment is ready.
