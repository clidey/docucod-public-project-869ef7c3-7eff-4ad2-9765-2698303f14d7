# System Requirements for GoogleTest

Ensure your development environment meets the necessary criteria to build and use GoogleTest effectively. This page details the minimum C++ standard required, supported compilers, operating systems, and other dependencies critical for success.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17** or later. This ensures compatibility with modern language features GoogleTest relies on.

- To enforce this in your build system, specify the C++ standard explicitly. For example, in CMake projects, add the following lines to your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If your project is a C project that incorporates GoogleTest only for validation, you can provide the flag directly when invoking `cmake`:

  ```bash
  cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17" ..
  ```

> Ensuring the C++17 standard is set prevents subtle compilation or linking errors related to language incompatibilities.


## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest is designed to be compatible with popular C++ compilers that fully support C++17, including but not limited to:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Clang**
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual Studio C++), Visual Studio 2015 or newer

### Visual Studio Specific Notes

- Visual Studio 2015 (version 14.0) or later is required.

- GoogleTest defaults to linking the C runtime library statically. To avoid runtime library conflicts in your projects (especially when mixing dynamic and static runtimes), GoogleTest provides a CMake option:

  ```bash
  -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

  This forces GoogleTest to use the dynamic runtime, matching most Visual Studio projects.


## 3. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is **cross-platform** and works on all major operating systems where the above compilers are supported:

- **Linux**
- **Windows** (including Windows Mobile with some caveats)
- **macOS**

Additionally, GoogleTest supports certain embedded platforms (ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52 with Arduino), although the usage model differs slightly.


## 4. Dependencies

- **Build Tools**: 
  - The recommended build tool is **CMake** version 3.14 or later. It handles generating native build files compatible with your compiler and platform.
  - Download CMake from [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/).

- **Threading Support**:
  - GoogleTest is thread-safe on systems with the **pthread** library available.
  - If pthread is not detected automatically, you may need to provide compiler/linker flags manually or instruct GoogleTest to explicitly enable or disable pthread support with the following compiler flags:

  ```cpp
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1   // Enable
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0   // Disable
  ```

- **Standard Libraries**: 
  - No additional third-party dependencies are required to use GoogleTest.


## 5. Summary of Requirements

| Requirement                 | Notes                                           |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum C++ standard         | C++17                                           |
| Supported compilers          | GCC, Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio 2015+)          |
| Supported platforms          | Linux, Windows, macOS, Embedded platforms (limited) |
| Build tools                 | CMake 3.14+                                     |
| Threading                   | pthread support highly recommended               |


## 6. Additional Compatibility Resources

For the most up-to-date information on platform and compiler compatibility, consult the following resources:

- GoogleTest GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Official CMakeLists.txt for detailed build-script guidance [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)


## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="C++ Standard Not Set Correctly">
If you experience compilation failures related to modern C++ syntax, verify your build explicitly enables C++17 or later. Modify your `CMakeLists.txt` as described above or pass the appropriate compiler flags.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Failures or Link Errors on *nix">
Ensure that the pthread library is linked properly. Using CMake typically handles this automatically. If you use custom build scripts, add `-pthread` to your compiler and linker flags.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows">
If you see linker errors about mismatched runtime libraries, use the `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` CMake flag to align GoogleTest with your project's runtime.
