# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment is prepared before building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page details the minimum compiler standards, supported operating systems, and required tools for a smooth setup.

---

## 1. Minimum Compiler Standards

GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports **C++17** or later. This is essential for successful compilation and optimal performance.

- **C++ Standard**: Use `-std=c++17` or equivalent in your build configuration.
  - For example, in CMake:
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```
  - If not using CMake, add compiler flags like `-std=c++17` manually.

- **Supported Compiler Versions**:
  - **GCC**: Version supporting C++17
  - **Clang**: Version supporting C++17
  - **MSVC**: Visual Studio 2015 (14.0) or later for GoogleMock compatibility

**Important:**
- Compilers earlier than these versions will cause build failures or undefined behavior.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Environments

GoogleTest is designed to be portable across many platforms. Below is the list of **officially supported** operating systems.

| Operating System                  | Notes                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Linux (including Android)        | Requires pthread library support       |
| macOS                           | Full support with Clang or GCC          |
| Windows Desktop                 | MSVC and MinGW support                   |
| Cygwin and MinGW                | Supported                               |
| FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD | Supported                       |
| Solaris, AIX, HP-UX            | Supported with caveats                   |
| Embedded platforms (ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52) | Limited support, requires tweaks |

**Note:** Some embedded or mobile platforms have limitations, including missing file system features or reduced threading support.

## 3. Required Tools and Libraries

To build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively, ensure the following tools and dependencies are installed:

- **Build System:**
  - Recommended: [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.14 or later for FetchContent support).
  - Alternative build systems supported via custom integration.

- **Compiler:**
  - Compatible C++17 compiler as noted above.

- **Threading Library:**
  - `pthread` library is required on most Unix-like platforms to enable thread safety and parallel testing features.

- **Optional:**
  - For building shared libraries (DLLs), linkers that support shared objects are needed.

---

## 4. Environment Compatibility Considerations

- **Thread Safety:**
  - GoogleTest is thread-safe if your environment supports pthreads.
  - For Windows, the native threading model is used.

- **Exception Support:**
  - Compiler must have exceptions enabled for full feature support.

- **Runtime Linking on Windows:**
  - By default, Visual Studio links C runtimes statically for GoogleTest.
  - Enable dynamic linkage with:
    ```cmake
    set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    ```

- **Macro Name Conflicts:**
  - GoogleTest uses macros like `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`, which might clash with other libraries.
  - If conflicts occur, define macros such as `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` and use prefixed macros (`GTEST_TEST`) instead.

---

## 5. Verifying Your Setup

Before proceeding to installation or test writing, confirm your environment matches these requirements:

1. **C++17 Compiler Check:**
    ```bash
    g++ --version
    clang++ --version
    cl.exe
    ```
    Verify version supports C++17.

2. **CMake Version Check:**
    ```bash
    cmake --version
    ```
    Version 3.14 or greater is recommended.

3. **pthread Availability:**
    - On Unix-like systems, `pthread.h` should be available.
    - You can test with:
      ```cpp
      #include <pthread.h>
      int main() { pthread_t t; return 0; }
      ```

4. **Operating System Recognition:**
    - Confirm you are on a supported OS (Linux, Windows Desktop, macOS, etc.).

5. **Network Access (Optional):**
    - If using CMake's `FetchContent` feature to download GoogleTest sources automatically, verify outbound network access to `github.com`.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Missing or Unsupported Compiler">
Ensure your compiler supports C++17. If your system default compiler is too old, consider installing a newer version or configuring the build to use an alternative compiler.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake Version Too Low">
Update CMake to 3.14 or higher to use features like `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`. Older versions can build GoogleTest but might require manual source downloads.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread Library">
On Unix-like systems, install development packages that provide pthread, e.g., `libpthread-stubs0-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Visual Studio Runtime Mismatch on Windows">
If you encounter linker errors about runtime libraries, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake or adjust your Visual Studio project settings to match runtime linkage.

## Summary

This page ensures you verify all system requirements and prerequisites before building or integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Confirm the compiler supports C++17, that your OS is supported, and that all necessary tools like CMake and pthread are installed. Addressing these foundational steps will save time and prevent common build and runtime issues.
