# System Requirements

This page defines the minimum compiler versions, required C++ standards, and supported platforms for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It guides you to verify whether your development environment is compatible with GoogleTest, highlighting platform-specific considerations and common caveats.

---

## 1. Minimum Compiler and C++ Version Requirements

GoogleTest mandates a compiler with support for at least **C++17** standards. This ensures modern language features and guarantees stable functionality of the framework.

### Key Requirements:

- **C++ Standard:** ISO C++17 or newer
- **Compiler Compatibility:**
  - GCC 7 and later
  - Clang 5 and later
  - MSVC 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) and later
  - Other popular compilers with compatible C++17 support

> If your compiler does not support C++17, attempting to build GoogleTest will result in a compilation error. You must upgrade your compiler or toolchain.

### How to check:

Use your compiler's version command and verify C++17 support. For example:
```bash
# GCC
gcc --version
# Clang
clang --version
# MSVC
cl.exe  # Check version in Visual Studio IDE
```

For build scripts using CMake, set the C++ standard explicitly to enforce compatibility:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

<Note>
The GoogleTest core will fail early if the C++ standard is below C++17. This is enforced at compile time.
</Note>

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be **cross-platform** and supports a wide range of operating systems, including:

- **Windows:** Desktop, MinGW, and Mobile variants
- **Linux:** Various distros, including Android
- **macOS & iOS:** Mac OSX and iOS platforms
- **BSD Variants:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD
- **Others:** Solaris, AIX, QNX, GNU Hurd, Haiku, Fuchsia, Embedded platforms like ESP32, ESP8266

### Platform-specific Notes:

- Some embedded and mobile platforms disable features such as stream redirection or multi-threading.
- Windows variants differ by desktop and mobile editions; ensure correct platform macros are detected.
- Android support starts from API level 9 with some function availability considerations.

GoogleTest uses internal platform macros to detect the environment automatically.

> For the complete, up-to-date list of supported platforms and related tooling versions, please consult the [Google Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## 3. Checking Environment Compatibility

### Step 1: Detect Platform Macros

GoogleTest internally defines macros for your platform, such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, etc.

When building, these macros are set automatically by the compiler environment.

### Step 2: Confirm Threading and Exception Support

- GoogleTest requires threading support where available, typically via pthreads on *nix systems or native Windows synchronization primitives.
- Exception handling is recommended but can be disabled with limited functionality.

You can verify threading and exception support by examining the following macros:
- `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` (1 if threading support enabled)
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` (1 if compiler supports exceptions)

### Step 3: Verify File System and Stream Redirection Availability

Some GoogleTest features need file system access and stream redirection support.

- `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` should be 1 for platform to be fully supported
- `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` enables capturing of stdout/stderr, used in some assertions and death tests

### Typical Pitfalls

- Embedded platforms or specialized mobile OS variants might lack full file system or threading support.
- Windows runtime library mismatches can cause build issues (see `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option).

## 4. Common Platform Compatibility Caveats

| Platform            | Notes                                                                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows             | Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option if linking errors about runtime libraries occur.   |
| Android             | Requires NDK API level 9 or higher for POSIX regex support; older NDK versions may limit capabilities. |
| Embedded Systems    | Some features like death tests, file system access, and stream redirection may be disabled. |
| macOS/iOS           | Death tests not supported on iOS.                                                     |

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

You can manually verify your environment's compatibility by following these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Compiler Version and C++ Standard">
Run your compiler's version command and attempt a minimal C++17 program build.

Example C++ code `test.cpp`:

```cpp
int main() { return 0; }
```

Compile with C++17 flag:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test
./test
```

</Step>
<Step title="Build GoogleTest on Your System">
Clone the latest version of GoogleTest and run a simple build (example using CMake):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Confirm no errors appear and GoogleTest compiles successfully.

</Step>
<Step title="Run GoogleTest's Built-in Tests">
After build, run GoogleTest's own test suite via:

```bash
ctest
# or
./googletest-build/gtest/gtest
```

Passing tests indicate the platform and compiler meet all Windows/Linux/macOS requirements.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Summary and Next Steps

You have verified that your environment supports:

- C++17 or newer compiler
- Support for threading and exceptions (optional but recommended)
- Supported platform OS
- Access to a conventional file system

With these in place, you are ready to proceed to **Installation** and **Configuration** steps. For more detailed platform-specific considerations, see the [Platform and Portability Configuration](/api-reference/integration-and-configuration/platform-and-portability) documentation.
