# System Requirements

This page outlines the minimum requirements to successfully build, configure, and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock, ensuring compatibility and smooth integration in your C++ environment. It covers the required C++ standard, supported platforms, compiler prerequisites, and necessary third-party dependencies.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17** or higher. This includes:

- Compiler support for the C++17 standard.
- Appropriate build flags to enforce or enable C++17 features.

> **Important:** If your project does not specify C++17, you must configure your build system accordingly. For example, with CMake:
>
> ```cmake
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
> ```
>
> Alternatively, pass compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` or use `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` for projects that can't modify the standard directly.

Failure to meet the C++17 requirement will prevent successful compilation.


## 2. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest officially supports major desktop platforms:

- **Linux**
- **Windows (Desktop, MinGW)**
- **Mac OS X**

It also targets cross-platform compatibility, but specific embedded or mobile platforms may have limited or no support.

> For detailed platform support updates and compiler compatibility, please check the policy at
> [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).


## 3. Compiler Support and Compiler Flags

GoogleTest relies on modern C++ compilers that fully or partially support C++17. Supported compilers include, but are not limited to:

- GCC (at least GCC 7 or newer recommended)
- Clang (at least Clang 5 or newer)
- MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or newer)

### Compiler Flags and Macros

- Enable threading support explicitly if required: Use `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` when your environment supports pthreads.
- For threading-disabled environments, use `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`.
- To build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows):

  ```
  -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  ```

- When building your tests linking to the shared GoogleTest library, add:

  ```
  -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  ```

- To resolve issues with macro conflicts, define `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` and use `GTEST_TEST` in your code.


## 4. Hardware and System Requirements

While GoogleTest is compact and not resource-intensive, minimal system requirements include:

- Sufficient memory and disk space to compile C++17 code
- Access to standard system headers and libraries (e.g., pthread on Linux)

> GoogleTest builds fast and does not impose heavy hardware demands.


## 5. Third-Party Dependencies

- **Threading Library**: GoogleTest uses pthreads where available for thread-safe execution. On Windows, native threading is used.
- **Standard C++ Libraries**: Must support C++17 features including `std::string_view`, `std::variant`, and others.
- **Optional**: Abseil (`absl`) and RE2 integration can be enabled for enhanced regular expression and flag handling, but they are not mandatory.


## 6. Additional Platform-Specific Notes

- On Windows, C++ runtime linkage can cause linker errors if mismatched between your project and GoogleTest. Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align runtime linkage.
- On systems without pthreads or restricted threading support, GoogleTest disables thread safety which may restrict some features.


## 7. Verification Check

After building or integrating GoogleTest, verify your environment meets requirements by:

- Ensuring no C++17 or compiler errors during build.
- Running a sample test binary to confirm correct execution.
- Checking that GoogleTest detects threading support by inspecting `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` if necessary.


## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Unsupported C++ Standard">
Ensure your compiler version targets C++17. Update your compiler or set the appropriate standard flag to enable C++17.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows with Runtime Library Mismatches">
Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` in your CMake configuration to align runtime linkage between GoogleTest and your application.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread on Linux or Failure to Link Threads">
Check that `-pthread` is included in both compiler and linker options. When using CMake, enabling `FindThreads` and linking against `Threads::Threads` is recommended.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pkg-config Fails to Find GoogleTest">
Set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to the directory containing `.pc` files after installation, e.g.,

```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
