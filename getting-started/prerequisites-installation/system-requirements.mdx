# System Requirements for GoogleTest

Before installing and building GoogleTest, it is crucial to verify that your development environment meets the necessary system requirements. This ensures compatibility and minimizes potential setup issues during installation or integration.

---

## 1. Required C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires support for the C++17 standard or later:

- Ensure your compiler supports **C++17** features.
- You can enforce the C++17 standard in your CMake project by adding:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If your project cannot update globally to C++17 (e.g., due to legacy code in C), pass the flag `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17"` explicitly during CMake invocation.

> Note: Attempts to build GoogleTest with C++ standards earlier than C++17 will fail.

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest officially supports the following operating systems and architectures:

- **Linux** (including popular distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions and variants such as MinGW)
- **macOS** (including Xcode build environments)

Additionally, GoogleTest has been tested and known to work on various BSD variants, and some embedded platforms (e.g., ESP32), though without full mainstream support.

---

## 3. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest is compatible with modern C++ compilers that support C++17. The tested and recommended compilers include:

| Compiler              | Minimum Version / Notes                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **GCC**               | 7.0 and newer                                   |
| **Clang**             | 5.0 and newer                                   |
| **Microsoft Visual C++** | Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 14.1) and newer        |
| **Apple Clang**       | Comes with Xcode matching Clang 5.0+            |

For Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC), a minimum version equivalent to Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 is required to compile GoogleMock (which is part of GoogleTest).

## 4. Threading and Exception Handling Requirements

- GoogleTest is fully **thread-safe** on platforms with pthread support.
- It detects pthread availability and configures itself accordingly.
- If your platform does not correctly detect pthread support, or you want to force-enable or disable it, define the compile-time flags:

  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to enable pthread support
  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to disable pthread support

- GoogleTest requires support for exception handling:
  - It detects whether exceptions are enabled.
  - Compilation will fail or be unsupported if exceptions are disabled.

---

## 5. File System and Stream Redirection

- GoogleTest expects a functional file system to operate correctly.
- Stream redirection (capturing stdout and stderr) is supported on most desktop OS platforms.
- Some embedded or mobile platforms may have limited or no support for stream redirection.

---

## 6. Visual Studio Runtime Compatibility

- By default, GoogleTest links with the **static C runtime** on Windows.
- New Visual Studio projects default to linking the **dynamic C runtime**, which may cause linker errors.
- To avoid runtime mismatch errors, use the CMake option:

```
-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

This switches GoogleTest to link with the dynamic runtime to match your project.

---

## 7. Development Tools

- **CMake**: Required for build scripts generation. Recommended minimum version is **3.14** to fully leverage modern features such as ``FetchContent``.
- **Git**: To clone the repository and optionally work with submodules.

Download and install these tools if unavailable:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## 8. Common Environment Checks

Before you begin the installation:

- Verify your compiler version and C++ support.
- Confirm operating system version and architecture compatibility.
- Ensure `cmake` and `git` are installed and in your system PATH.
- On Linux/macOS, ensure pthread libraries are installed (`libpthread`).
- On Windows, ensure Visual Studio Build Tools and SDKs are installed.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
If C++17 support appears missing, check your compiler's documentation and update to a supported version.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For Windows users experiencing runtime linkage errors, explicitly set `gtest_force_shared_crt` to ON as described above.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If GoogleTest does not detect pthread support correctly, add the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` flag manually during build configuration.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Attempting to build on unsupported platforms or with unsupported compilers will lead to compile-time errors or undefined behaviors.
</Warning>
