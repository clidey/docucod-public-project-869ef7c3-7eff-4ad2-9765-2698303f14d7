# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

This page outlines the essential system requirements and supported platforms to ensure a smooth setup and successful build environment for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It is critical to verify that your development environment meets these prerequisites before proceeding with installation and usage.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be highly portable and support the following major operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (including Windows Mobile and Windows CE variants)
- **macOS**
- **Embedded platforms:** ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52 when using Arduino

<Tip>
The majority of users on desktop platforms will work within Linux, Windows, or macOS environments. Support for embedded platforms like ESP8266 or NRF52 is available but requires specialized setup involving Arduino environments.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Required Compilers and Language Standards

To build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively, the following compiler and language standards are mandatory:

- **C++17 Support:** The compiler must support the C++17 standard or newer.

  - You can enforce this by setting appropriate compiler flags, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang.
  - When using CMake, specify this with:

    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```

- **Microsoft Visual C++:** Version 2015 (14.0) or later is required.

<Tip>
Ensure your chosen compiler fully supports C++17 features as they are essential for GoogleTest internals and modern test writing.
</Tip>

## 3. Important Dependencies

- **Thread Library:** For thread-safe tests, support for the pthread library is necessary on Unix-like systems.
  - If building on platforms without native pthread support, alternative threading may be used internally.
  - When using CMake, `find_package(Threads)` is automatically checked, and GoogleTest adapts accordingly.

- **CMake (recommended build system):**
  - Minimum supported version: 3.13
  - Used for generating native build files on all platforms.

- **Abseil Flags (optional):**
  - When available, Abseil is used to manage command-line flags for GoogleMock.

## 4. Platform Specific Considerations

### Windows

- The project supports desktop Windows and Windows Mobile.
- Visual Studio users must use at least VS2015.
- Visual Studio projects typically link C runtimes dynamically by default, but GoogleTest links statically by default. To resolve potential linker conflicts, the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option can be enabled.

### Mac OS

- Builds require Xcode command-line tools.
- Supported through CMake with Xcode project generation.

### Linux

- Supports GCC 7.0.0 and newer, Clang, and Intel compilers supporting C++17.
- Libraries linked dynamically or statically.

### Embedded Systems

- Platforms like ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52 with Arduino are supported.
- Entry points differ (using `setup()` and `loop()` instead of `main`).

## 5. Verification of Environment

Before building GoogleTest, verify your environment using these steps:

### On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS):

1. Check compiler and version:

   ```bash
   g++ --version
   clang++ --version
   ```

2. Check cmake version:

   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```

3. Confirm C++17 support by compiling a minimal test file.

### On Windows:

1. Open Developer Command Prompt and run:

   ```cmd
   cl
   cmake --version
   ```

2. Confirm Visual Studio version is 2015 or newer.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting Tips

- **Compiler too old or lacking C++17 support:** Upgrade your compiler or adjust the C++ standard flag.
- **Mismatched runtimes on Windows:** Ensure that your project and GoogleTest use compatible runtime libraries (static vs dynamic).
- **Missing pthreads:** On Unix-like systems, verify that pthreads is installed and properly linked.
- **CMake version too old:** Upgrade to at least version 3.13 to support GoogleTest build scripts.

## 7. Next Steps

After confirming that your system meets these requirements, proceed to the [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-instructions) page to start building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

For detailed platform-specific integration, consult the [Supported Platforms & Integration](/overview/architecture-features-integration/platforms-and-integration) page.
