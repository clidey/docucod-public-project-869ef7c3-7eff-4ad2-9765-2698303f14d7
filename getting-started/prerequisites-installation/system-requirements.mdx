# System Requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock

This page outlines the fundamental system requirements necessary to build and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock successfully. Before proceeding with installation and configuration, ensure your development environment meets the following conditions.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be cross-platform and officially support the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop editions, with Visual Studio support)
- **macOS** (including integration with Xcode)

These platforms are actively maintained and tested to ensure compatibility and stable operation.

---

## 2. Compiler Requirements

To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock, your compiler must support C++17 or later standards. The following compilers and versions are recognized as suitable:

- GCC with support for C++17
- Clang with C++17 support
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer

Make sure your compiler is configured to use at least C++17. This can be enforced in CMake or your build system by specifying the C++ standard explicitly, for example:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

If your project does not use CMake or you want to pass compiler flags directly, you can add:

```bash
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17"
```

Ensure your build environment respects these requirements to avoid compilation errors.

---

## 3. Threading and Libraries

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where the `pthread` library is available and supported.

- On **Unix-like systems** (Linux, macOS), pthread support is assumed and enabled.
- On **Windows**, native threading primitives are used.

If your environment fails to detect pthread support automatically, you can manually enable or disable it by passing the following compiler flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1    # to enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0    # to disable
```

When using your own build scripts, remember to link against pthread (`-pthread`) and add any necessary compiler flags for threading support.

---

## 4. Minimum C++ Language Standard

GoogleTest mandates the use of C++17 features. If your compiler or environment uses an older standard, GoogleTest will not compile. Since this is enforced inside `gtest-port.h`, attempting to compile with C++14 or earlier will result in an error similar to:

```
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
```

To fix this, explicitly set C++17 or newer standard support.

---

## 5. Build Tooling

To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock efficiently, the following tooling is recommended:

- **CMake (version 3.14 or newer)**: The primary build system used by GoogleTest.
- For Windows, having **Visual Studio** installed enables building via `.sln` files generated by CMake.
- On macOS, having **Xcode** installed enables building via `.xcodeproj` files generated by CMake.

If you prefer other build tools or package managers, ensure they support linking to C++17 projects and integration with pthread (or equivalent threading).

---

## 6. Additional Notes

- **Dynamic vs Static Runtimes on Windows:**
  Visual Studio by default links C runtimes dynamically, but GoogleTest links statically. This may cause linker errors such as
  `error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'`.

  You can fix this by enabling the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` which will link GoogleTest's runtimes dynamically:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

- **Optional Macros for Tweaking:**
  GoogleTest can be customized via compiler flags starting with `-DGTEST_`, for example, to control thread-safety, macro name clashes, or shared library usage.


---

## Quick Verification Checklist Before Installation

1. Confirm your OS is Linux, Windows, or macOS.
2. Verify your compiler supports C++17.
3. Check that pthread is available or appropriately configured.
4. Confirm CMake (â‰¥3.14) is installed if using CMake builds.
5. On Windows, have Visual Studio ready for generated solution files.


## Troubleshooting Tips

- **C++17 Support Error:**
  Ensure your build system or compiler flags indicate `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

- **Threading Link Errors:**
  If link errors about pthread occur, confirm your linker flags include `-pthread` on Unix-like systems.

- **Visual Studio Runtime Mismatch:**
  Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align runtime linkage.

- **Unsupported OS or Compiler:**
  Check the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for compatible versions.
