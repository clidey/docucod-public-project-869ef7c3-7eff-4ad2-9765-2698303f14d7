# System Requirements for GoogleTest

This page outlines the minimum requirements you need to meet before installing and using GoogleTest. Ensuring your system aligns with these requirements helps avoid compatibility issues and guarantees a smooth setup.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler. This means:

- Your compiler must support **at least C++17** features.
- Ensure your build environment enables C++17 or higher standards explicitly.

**Tip:** You can enable C++17 in your build system using these common flags:

- GCC/Clang: `-std=c++17`
- MSVC: Use the Visual Studio project setting for C++ language standard or `/std:c++17`

GoogleTest will refuse to compile if the C++ version is below C++17, as indicated inside `gtest-port.h` with an error for versions below 201703L.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide array of modern operating systems, including but not limited to:

- **Linux** distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants are mostly unsupported for some features)
- **macOS** and **iOS**
- BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD)
- Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and other Unix-like systems

The library detects the platform automatically via macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC` as defined in `gtest-port-arch.h`.

**Note:** Some embedded or specialized operating systems (e.g., Xtensa, QURT, ESP platforms) are supported with caveats or limited functionality.

**Important:** If you encounter platform-specific issues, please refer to GoogleTest's support channels or consider applying platform-specific tweaks as suggested in the [Platform-Specific Guidance](guides/advanced-practices/platform-specific-scenarios) documentation.

---

## 3. Build Tools and Compilers

GoogleTest relies on your build environment to:

- Provide a **C++17-capable compiler** (GCC 7.0+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017 Update 3+ or equivalent)
- Support standard build systems like **CMake** and **Make**

### CMake

GoogleTest ships with an official CMake build script (`CMakeLists.txt`) which supports:

- Generating platform-native build files
- Handling compiler flags, including thread support and C++ standard enforcement

**Requirement:** Minimum CMake version **3.13** is needed to build GoogleTest.

> To note: CMake support is community-maintained, so platform-specific issues in CMake may require community help.

### Compiler Conformance

- GoogleTest defines and expects feature detection macros internally to check availability of threads, exceptions, RTTI, etc.
- MSVC versions prior to Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 are not supported due to C++17 limitations.

### Thread Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** if your environment supports `pthread` (POSIX Threads) or a compatible threading library.
- You can verify or control this with the `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro.

---

## 4. System Resources

GoogleTest itself is lightweight and does not require substantial resources.

However, practical considerations include:

- **Disk space:** Minimal, mostly for source files and build artifacts.
- **Memory:** Dependent on your tests, but GoogleTest does not impose heavy memory demands.

Ensure the build system and environment have enough privileges and space for temporary files and compiled binaries.

---

## 5. Additional Dependencies and Environment Settings

GoogleTest does not rely on external dependencies beyond the standard C++ library and system threading support.

If you want to build GoogleMock together with GoogleTest, additional dependencies may apply (Abseil, RE2) but that is optional.

Environment variables affecting GoogleTest behavior:

- `TEST_TMPDIR` and `TEST_SRCDIR` can be set to customize temporary directories, but defaults work in typical systems.

---

## 6. Common Prerequisites Before Installing

1. Ensure your compiler supports C++17 by running a simple C++ program with the appropriate `-std=c++17` flag.
2. Install CMake (version 3.13 or later) if you plan to build using CMake.
3. Confirm platform compatibility and presence of necessary system headers (`pthread.h` on POSIX).
4. For Windows, verify your build environment aligns with the Microsoft toolchain supported versions.

## Summary Table

| Requirement           | Details                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C++ Standard**      | Minimum C++17 support, verified in source via macro check    |
| **OS Platforms**      | Linux, Windows (Desktop), macOS, BSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX    |
| **Build Tools**       | CMake â‰¥ 3.13, Make, compatible C++17 compiler                |
| **Threading Support** | pthreads library or compatible threading support             |
| **Memory & Disk**     | Minimal, sufficient resources for build and test runs        |

## Troubleshooting Common System Requirement Issues

### Problem: Compiler reports C++ version too low

- Confirm compiler version supports C++17.
- Ensure build flags enable C++17 (e.g., `-std=c++17`).

### Problem: Build fails due to missing pthread or threading support

- Ensure `pthread` development package is installed (commonly `libpthread-dev` on Linux).
- Disable pthread with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if unsupported but expect limited thread safety.

### Problem: CMake version too old

- Upgrade CMake to at least version 3.13.

## Next Steps

Now that your environment meets the system requirements:

- Proceed to the [Installing with CMake](getting-started/prerequisites-installation/install-via-cmake) guide to build and install GoogleTest.
- Explore [Configuring GoogleTest in Your Project](getting-started/initial-configuration/add-to-project) to integrate testing into your workflow.

<Tip>
If you plan to use GoogleTest in continuous integration pipelines or cross-compilation environments, consult the [Integration with Development Pipelines](overview/integration-and-ecosystem/integration-overview) page and [Pkg-config usage](docs/pkgconfig.md) for advanced setup.
