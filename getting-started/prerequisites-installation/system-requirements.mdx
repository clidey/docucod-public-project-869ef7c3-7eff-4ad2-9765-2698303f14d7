# System Requirements & Prerequisites

This document outlines the essential system requirements, compiler versions, language standards, and dependencies to prepare your environment for successfully building and using **GoogleTest**.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest strictly adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring broad and stable support across commonly used platforms and compilers. For detailed information and up-to-date lists of supported platforms and compiler versions, review the [official supported versions table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

> **Key Supported Platforms Include:**
> - Linux
> - Windows (including MinGW)
> - macOS (including iOS)
> - Other UNIX-like operating systems (FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.)

GoogleTest detects the platform automatically and supports a range of environments, but it is primarily tested and stable on mainstream desktop and server platforms.


## 2. Minimum Compiler Versions & Language Standards

Building GoogleTest requires a **C++17-compliant compiler** as a minimum. GoogleTest tests and uses features that demand at least this C++ standard.

- **Minimum required C++ standard:** C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017)

GoogleTest enforces this requirement and will **not compile** if the compiler version or C++ standard is older:

- Attempts to build with a C++ standard older than C++17 will produce an error, e.g.,
  ```
  #error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
  ```

- **Examples of supported compiler minimum versions:**
  - GCC 7.0 or newer
  - Clang 5.0 or newer
  - MSVC 2017 (version 19.11) or newer

The build system and official CMake scripts automatically set the flag `cxx_std_17` to enforce the minimum standard.

## 3. Dependencies

GoogleTest has minimal external dependencies, making it easy to integrate.

- **Abseil (absl) dependencies:**
  - When configured to use Abseil libraries (through `GTEST_HAS_ABSL` flag), GoogleTest requires Abseil's components like `absl/flags` and `re2` for regex support.
  - If Abseil dependencies are not present or disabled, GoogleTest falls back to using system POSIX-style regex or its own simple regex implementation.

- **POSIX and pthreads:**
  - On POSIX-compliant systems (Linux, macOS, BSD variants), GoogleTest uses pthreads for threading and synchronization.
  - On Windows, native Windows threading primitives are used instead.

- **Filesystem availability:**
  - A working file system is required for some features like death tests.

## 4. Environment & Compiler Flags

### Required Compiler Flags (automatically set by CMake)

- `-std=c++17` or equivalent flag to enable C++17 support
- Appropriate flags for threading support,
  - For example, `-pthread` on Linux
- On MSVC:
  - Minimum Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC compiler version >= 19.11)
  - Recommended `/utf-8` flag for UTF-8 source file handling

### Common Build System Settings

When using CMake (recommended):
- GoogleTestâ€™s CMakeLists.txt automatically configures flags to meet minimum requirements.
- Optionally, you can control thread safety and linking with flags like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

### Compiler Checks

GoogleTest performs environment detection at compile-time to configure itself correctly:
- Detects available threading library
- Detects exception support
- Detects RTTI support
- Defines macros indicating platform and compiler capabilities

This ensures that users do not generally have to tweak these settings manually unless in exotic or unsupported environments.

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- Always use a modern C++17-capable compiler to avoid compilation errors.
- Use supported platforms advertised by the Foundational C++ Support Policy to minimize integration issues.
- Prefer building GoogleTest with CMake to leverage automatic environment detection and compiler flag management.
- If you encounter build issues, verify your compiler version and C++ standard settings.
- When using GoogleTest with Abseil, ensure Abseil libraries and headers are available and properly configured.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues">
<Accordion title="Compilation Error: Unsupported C++ Standard">
If you see errors complaining about C++ versions less than C++17 being unsupported:

- Check that your compiler command includes the `-std=c++17` or appropriate flag.
- Verify that your compiler version supports C++17.
- With CMake, ensure `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)` are set.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Library Issues">
Errors linking pthreads or threading support:

- On Linux/macOS, confirm that `-pthread` is passed to the compiler and linker.
- On Windows, ensure native threading support without pthreads.
- For custom builds, define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` as suitable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Abseil or RE2 Dependencies">
If building with Abseil support enabled but dependencies are missing:

- Ensure Abseil and RE2 libraries are installed or included in your build.
- Disable Abseil support if you do not want to depend on these.
</Accordion>
