# System Requirements

An essential step before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock is ensuring your development environment meets the necessary system, compiler, platform, and language standards. This page outlines the supported compilers, operating systems, and C++ language standards compatibility required to build and run GoogleTest successfully.

---

## Supported C++ Standard

- GoogleTest requires a compiler environment with **C++17 support or higher**.
- To ensure compatibility, build systems should explicitly enforce this standard.

<Check>
Make sure your build configuration specifies C++17 or later. For example, in CMake, use:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Alternatively, add compiler flags manually if your project does not use C++.
</Check>

> Attempting to compile GoogleTest in environments with older C++ standards will result in errors and is unsupported.

---

## Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be portable and supports the following platforms:

- **Linux** (including Linux variants such as Android with appropriate API levels)
- **Windows** (Desktop and MinGW)
- **Mac OS X**

<Info>
GoogleTest's platform support aligns with the [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) maintained by Google. For details on tested compiler versions and platforms, consult their support matrix here: [Supported Platforms Table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).
</Info>

> Note: While GoogleTest compiles and runs on these platforms, certain platform-specific features (e.g., structured exception handling on Windows) are enabled conditionally based on the detected environment.

---

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest supports any C++17-capable compiler, including but not limited to:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) 7.0 and above**
- **Clang**
- **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC) 2017 (version 15.3) and later**
- **Intel LLVM compiler supporting C++17**

The build scripts included with GoogleTest provide fine-tuned compiler and linker settings for these environments:

- Compiler warnings are set rigorously (`-Wall`, `-Wshadow`, `-Wundef`, `/W4` for MSVC).
- Exceptions and RTTI support are detected and used where available.

<Tip>
If you encounter linker errors related to runtime libraries on Windows (such as mismatches between static vs dynamic CRT), use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtimes:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

This ensures GoogleTest links its C runtime libraries similarly to your project.
</Tip>

---

## Multithreading Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms where the POSIX pthread library is available and on Windows desktop environments (excluding some mobile or embedded variants).
- The build automatically detects pthread availability and defines `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` accordingly.

<Note>
If your environment misdetects pthread support, you can force it:

- To enable pthread support: `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`
- To disable pthread support: `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`

Make sure to link against the pthread library (`-pthread`) when using pthread support outside CMake.
</Note>

---

## Filesystem and I/O Stream Redirection

GoogleTest requires basic file system and stream redirection features to function fully, especially for:

- Test output capturing
- Death tests

Platforms with restricted or no filesystem support (some embedded targets) may not support all GoogleTest features.

---

## Shared Library (DLL) Usage on Windows

- GoogleTest can be built as a static or shared library.
- To build as a shared library, add the compiler flag:

  ```
  -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  ```

- To link your tests against the shared GoogleTest library, add:

  ```
  -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  ```

Hosting your tests on shared libraries requires extra linker setup; consult your compiler documentation for creating shared libraries properly.

---

## Preconditions Checklist

Before proceeding to installation and test writing:

- Confirm your compiler supports **C++17 or newer**.
- Verify your platform is Linux, Windows Desktop, or Mac OS X.
- Understand if pthreads are available and enabled for your environment.
- If on Windows, decide between static or shared linking and prepare any runtime library flags accordingly.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Requirement Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Make sure your compiler version supports C++17. Upgrade your compiler or adjust your build system to specify the required standard.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows">
Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to resolve conflicts between static and dynamic CRT linkage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread Link Errors on Linux">
Ensure you add `-pthread` to your compiler and linker flags if not using CMake or if CMake misconfigures threading support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Platform Not Supported">
GoogleTest currently does not support embedded platforms with limited or no filesystem or stream redirection support. Check platform compatibility before attempting installation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

After confirming your environment meets these requirements, proceed to the following steps:

- [Installation Methods](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-methods) - Learn how to download and build GoogleTest.
- [Initial Configuration](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/initial-configuration) - Set up compiler flags and linking instructions.
- [Write and Build Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-run/create-first-test) - Begin writing your test cases.
