# System Requirements

An overview of required compilers, build tools, C++ standards, and supported platforms for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page ensures your environment is compatible before you start.

---

## 1. Overview

Before setting up GoogleTest and GoogleMock in your development environment, ensure your system meets the necessary requirements. Compatibility and correct versions of compilers, C++ standards, and build tools are essential for a smooth installation and reliable operation.

This guide covers:
- Supported operating systems and platforms
- Compatible C++ compiler versions
- Required C++ language standard
- Recommended build tools

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). It supports the major operating systems where C++ development typically occurs.

### Supported Operating Systems
- **Linux**
- **Windows** (Desktop editions)
- **macOS**

For platform-specific details and version compatibility, visit our [Supported Platforms](platforms.md) page.

---

## 3. Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler with support for at least **C++17**. This is a hard requirement to ensure compatibility with modern C++ features used within GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

### Minimum Compiler Requirements
- **GCC**: version 7.0 or higher
- **Clang**: version 5.0 or higher
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio)**: 2017 Update 3 or higher

Make sure your compiler is configured to use the C++17 standard or newer.

### How to Verify Your Compiler Version
Run the following in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
# GCC
gcc --version

# Clang
clang --version

# MSVC
cl
```

Consult your compiler's documentation for how to enable C++17 support. For example, with GCC or Clang, use the flag `-std=c++17` when compiling.

---

## 4. C++ Standard Requirements

Since GoogleTest is implemented using modern C++ features, your project must be compiled with **C++17** or later.

### Enabling C++17
- **CMake projects:** Set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 and enforce it by setting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED`.

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- **Manual compiler flags:** Add `-std=c++17` (GCC/Clang) or the appropriate MSVC flag.

> <Note>
> Compiling with earlier C++ versions will cause compilation errors or undefined behavior.
> </Note>

---

## 5. Build Tools

GoogleTest supports a variety of build systems to accommodate diverse user preferences.

### Commonly Supported Build Tools
- **CMake** (recommended): Provides cross-platform generation of native build files.
- **Make**: For Unix-like environments.
- **Ninja**: Fast build system supported via CMake.
- **Visual Studio**: On Windows, generated project files are fully supported.

### Installing Build Tools
- **CMake:** Download from [https://cmake.org/install/](https://cmake.org/install/)
- **Make:** Usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS or available via package managers.
- **Ninja:** Available via package managers or [https://ninja-build.org/](https://ninja-build.org/)

For detailed instructions on building GoogleTest with CMake, see [Installation on Different Platforms](installation-methods.md).

## 6. System Dependencies and Features

GoogleTest detects and uses features available in your environment. Some internal features depend on platform support:

| Feature                       | Availability                       |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Thread Safety (pthreads)       | Linux, macOS, Windows (partial)  |
| Exception Handling             | Enabled if compiler supports      |
| File System Access             | Required for various GoogleTest utilities |
| UTF-16 Wide String Support    | Platform dependent                |

> <Tip>
> On some embedded or mobile platforms, filesystem or threading support may be limited, which can restrict GoogleTest's full functionality.
> </Tip>

If you use a build environment that disables exceptions or RTTI, GoogleTest can adapt but some features might be compromised.

## 7. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you encounter compile or link errors:

- Verify your compiler version and C++ standard flag.
- Ensure that your build tools are up to date and properly configured.
- On Windows, watch out for mismatched runtime linkage (`static` vs `dynamic` C runtimes). CMake provides the option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to force dynamic linkage.
- If using custom build scripts, confirm that all necessary compiler flags are passed correctly.

For help diagnosing build or integration errors, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](common-issues.md) guide.

## 8. Summary

| Requirement               | Minimum Version / Specification       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Operating System          | Linux, Windows Desktop, macOS       |
| C++ Compiler             | GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017 Update 3|
| C++ Standard             | C++17 or higher                      |
| Build Tools              | CMake 3.14+, Make, Ninja, Visual Studio |

Ensure your development environment meets these requirements to build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock reliably.
