# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

GoogleTest, the widely-adopted C++ testing framework, is designed to work efficiently across a broad set of compilers, platforms, and C++ standards. This page guides you through its system requirements and supported environments to ensure you can leverage GoogleTest effectively from the start.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

To build and run GoogleTest successfully, your development environment **must support C++17 or later**. This is non-negotiable because GoogleTest leverages modern C++17 language features and library facilities.

### How to ensure C++17 support:

- When using **CMake**, specify the C++ standard explicitly in your project:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

  This guarantees compilations adhere to C++17.

- For custom builds or other build systems, add the appropriate compiler flags:

  - GCC and Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - MSVC: `/std:c++17`

### Common pitfall

> GoogleTest will not compile with older C++ standards (e.g., C++11 or C++14). Attempting to build with such standards will result in immediate errors.


## 2. Supported Compilers and Platforms

GoogleTest supports a variety of operating systems and compilers aligned with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and its [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Platforms

GoogleTest detects and supports the following primary OS platforms:

- Linux (including Android)
- Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile)
- macOS and iOS
- BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
- Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS
- Embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52

### Compiler Compatibility

- GCC (versions supporting C++17 and later)
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual C++ (VS 2017 Update 3 and later)
- Intel C++ Compiler
- Other supported compilers per the foundational policy

### Platform-Compiler Detection

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform and compiler environment during compilation, activating the relevant macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`). This automatic detection helps the framework optimize for thread-safety, exceptions, and platform-specific behaviors.

### Threading and Exception Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe when pthreads or compatible threading libraries are available. This is automatically controlled by macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`.

- Exception support is detected automatically (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`). If exceptions are disabled, GoogleTest adapts accordingly but some features may be limited.

### Specialized Platform Considerations

- On embedded platforms like ESP8266 or ESP32, GoogleTest initializes differently using Arduino setup and loop functions.

- Windows Mobile and embedded platforms have reduced file system availability and limited stream redirection.

## 3. Dependencies and Build System Support

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with popular build systems that respect its platform and threading requirements.

- **CMake**: GoogleTest ships with a robust CMake build configuration supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- **Bazel**: GoogleTest can be built and integrated into Bazel workspaces.

- **pkg-config**: For environments using pkg-config, GoogleTest provides `.pc` files to help compilers and linkers locate necessary flags, macro definitions, and libraries.

### Using pkg-config with GoogleTest

Ensure pkg-config can find GoogleTest’s `.pc` files. If installed to a custom directory, update `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` accordingly:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
```

For cross-compiling environments, set these variables to inject the correct sysroot paths:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS=yes
export PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS=yes
export PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=/path/to/sysroot
export PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=${PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR}/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
```

This setup guarantees correct include and library paths during compile and link.

## 4. Summary Table: Key System Requirements

| Requirement                   | Description                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **C++ Standard**             | C++17 (or higher) support is mandatory              |
| **Minimum Compiler Versions**| MSVC 2017 Update 3, GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+            |
| **Threading Support**         | pthreads or equivalent for multi-thread safety      |
| **File System**               | Required for death tests and output redirection      |
| **Build Systems Supported**  | CMake, Bazel, pkg-config                             |

## 5. Tips for Ensuring Compatibility

- Always verify your compiler’s C++ standard version support before building.

- If using CMake, set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` explicitly.

- Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if your environment doesn't autodetect pthread support but you have it.

- If you want to build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows), use `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and link your tests with `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

- For embedded platforms, consult the platform-specific initialization details.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting System Requirement Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Unsupported C++ Standard">
Ensure the compiler is set to use C++17 or later. Check your build flags or CMake settings. For example, in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Support Not Detected">
If GoogleTest complains about missing pthreads support, define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` during compilation. Also ensure your linker receives `-pthread` or equivalent flags.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="pkg-config Cannot Find GoogleTest">
Verify that the `.pc` files for GoogleTest are installed in a directory included in `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. For custom installs, export:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/your/install/path/lib/pkgconfig
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Windows Dynamic Runtime Library Mismatch">
On Windows with MSVC, use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to ensure runtime libraries match between your project and GoogleTest:

```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```
