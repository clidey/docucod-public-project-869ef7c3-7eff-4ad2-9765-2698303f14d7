# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Learn about the minimum C++ standards, supported platforms, and dependencies necessary for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide ensures compatibility and helps you prepare your environment for a smooth installation and integration process.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires **C++17 or later** to build and run correctly.

- The build scripts enforce this requirement by checking your compiler's support for C++17 features.
- If your project does not already specify C++17, you must configure your build system to use it. For example, with CMake, add:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- Without C++17 support, the build will fail with preprocessor errors.

*Tip:* If you have legacy or mixed-language codebases, ensure your GoogleTest components are compiled separately using C++17 enabled compiler flags.

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms. The major, fully supported environments are:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions, including MSVC and MinGW toolchains)
- **Mac OS X** (including iOS for basic compatibility)

GoogleTest also attempts to support other Unix-like OSes including:

- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD
- NetBSD
- DragonFlyBSD
- Solaris
- AIX

Support on non-mainstream or embedded platforms may be limited or experimental.

*Note:* While GoogleTest attempts to detect environment capabilities automatically, some specialized platforms require manual overrides or lack certain features.

## 3. Compiler and Toolchain Compatibility

GoogleTest has been tested with and supports the following compilers:

- GNU GCC (version 7 or later recommended)
- Clang (various versions)
- Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC 2017 Update 3 or newer)
- Intel C++ Compiler
- Sun Pro CC

GoogleTest detects compiler features such as RTTI and exception support automatically. You may need to explicitly enable or disable these via compiler flags or macros if automatic detection fails.

## 4. Threading and Synchronization Dependencies

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms that support `pthreads` or native Windows threading APIs.
- If your platform supports `pthreads`, GoogleTest will enable multi-threading features automatically.
- On Windows or MinGW, GoogleTest uses native threading APIs.
- To enforce threading support or disable it, define the macro `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` as `1` or `0` in your build flags.

<Tip>
If your build fails due to missing threading support, add:

```
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

to your compiler flags and ensure you link against `pthread` on Unix-like platforms.
</Tip>

## 5. Filesystem and Path Support

- GoogleTest requires a functional files system to support features like:
  - Temporary directory manipulations (`TempDir()`)
  - Source directory discovery (`SrcDir()`)
  - Death tests (require file system)

- On platforms without a functional file system (e.g., some embedded systems), GoogleTest disables these features.

## 6. Exception Handling and RTTI

- GoogleTest supports environments both with and without C++ exceptions.
- It automatically detects exception availability and enables or disables exception-dependent features accordingly.
- Similarly, Runtime Type Information (RTTI) usage is automatically detected. If your compiler disables RTTI, some GoogleTest features that depend on RTTI will be disabled.

## 7. Wide String and Unicode Handling

- On most platforms, support for `std::wstring` is available and enabled.
- Certain platforms (such as Cygwin, Solaris, and some embedded targets) do not support `std::wstring` properly. GoogleTest detects this and disables those features accordingly.

## 8. Platform Macros and Overrides

- GoogleTest defines internal macros to identify the OS it is compiled on.
- These macros begin with `GTEST_OS_` and indicate the precise platform.
- Users should not define or redefine these macros.
- For unsupported or unusual platforms, users can tweak GoogleTest by defining control macros in compiler flags (see [Customization Points](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md)).

## 9. Supported Features Matrix

| Feature                     | Status                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| C++17 minimum standard       | Required                      |
| Multi-threading (pthreads)   | Enabled if supported          |
| Windows threading            | Supported                    |
| File system support          | Required for death tests and I/O|
| Exception handling           | Supported but optional       |
| RTTI                        | Supported but optional       |
| Wide string support (`wstring`) | Supported on major platforms |
| Death Tests                  | Supported on platforms with files system and OS support |

## 10. Summary

To ensure GoogleTest runs smoothly in your environment:

- Use a compiler and OS that supports C++17 or newer.
- Verify threading support (e.g., pthreads on Linux, native on Windows).
- Ensure a working filesystem is available.
- Adjust compiler flags for exceptions and RTTI as necessary.
- Consult the customization points if you have a specialized platform.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

<Tip>
If your build fails or GoogleTest features are not available, do the following:

1. Check your compiler version and C++ standard compliance.
2. Verify that threading libraries are accessible and linked.
3. Confirm filesystem calls work in your environment.
4. Explicitly define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` to override automatic detection.
5. Review any error output for clues on unsupported features.
</Tip>

<Warning>
GoogleTest does **not** support C++ standards earlier than C++17. Using older standards will cause build failures.
</Warning>
