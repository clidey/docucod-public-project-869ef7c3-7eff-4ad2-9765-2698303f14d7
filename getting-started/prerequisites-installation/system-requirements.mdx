# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are comprehensive C++ testing frameworks that require a compatible environment to build and run correctly. This document clarifies the supported operating systems, compilers, and C++ standards essential for working with GoogleTest, ensuring smooth installation and integration.

---

## 1. Overview of System Requirements

To successfully build and run GoogleTest, your development environment must meet the following foundational requirements:

- **C++17 Standard Support:** Your compiler must fully support the C++17 standard or newer. This is crucial as GoogleTest leverages features from C++17 for modern, safe, and efficient code.
- **Platform Compatibility:** GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms including mainstream desktop OSes and some embedded systems.
- **Build Tools:** Common build systems like CMake are supported. For CMake, a minimum version of 3.13 is required, with some features needing 3.14 or later.

<Check>
Ensure your development environment is configured with a C++17-compliant compiler and an updated build toolchain to avoid build errors.
</Check>

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest automatically detects and supports the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (including Windows Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile, and Windows Store Apps)
- **macOS** and **iOS**
- **FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD**
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **z/OS**
- **Embedded platforms:** QNX, ESP32, ESP8266, Xtensa, NXP QN9090, NRF52

The detection and conditional compilation ensure platform-specific features and capabilities are enabled appropriately.

---

## 3. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest’s build process supports various compilers that meet or exceed C++17 support:

- **GCC:** Version 7.0 and later
- **Clang:** Recent versions with C++17 support
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC version >= 19.11) and later
- **Intel LLVM**
- **Sun Pro** and **IBM Visual Age (XL)** compilers with C++17 capability

The project’s CMake configuration automatically adjusts compiler and linker flags for supported compilers, enhancing compatibility.

---

## 4. Key Build and Runtime Requirements

### 4.1 C++ Standard Version

- GoogleTest requires C++17 or later.
- You can enforce this by setting compiler flags or defining the CMake variable `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 along with `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` set to `ON`.

### 4.2 Threading Support

- When pthreads are available (common on UNIX-like systems), GoogleTest is fully thread-safe and enables multi-threaded test execution.
- To force use or disable of pthread support, define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` respectively during compilation.

### 4.3 Runtime Libraries

- On Windows with MSVC, GoogleTest by default links with static CRT libraries.
- To match your project's runtime (especially when dynamic linking is used), enable the CMake flag `gtest_force_shared_crt`.

### 4.4 Optional Features

- GoogleTest supports shared libraries (DLLs) via `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and requires `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` for dependent tests.
- Internal configurations include platform-specific support for exceptions, RTTI, and POSIX features.

---

## 5. Platform Detection and Macros

GoogleTest internally defines macros to identify the platform and enable corresponding features.

Examples include:

| Macro Name               | Description            |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `GTEST_OS_LINUX`         | Linux OS               |
| `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`       | Windows (all flavors)  |
| `GTEST_OS_MAC`           | macOS                  |
| `GTEST_OS_IOS`           | iOS                    |
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`      | Pthreads library present |
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`   | Exceptions enabled     |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`         | RTTI enabled           |
| `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`  | File system available  |

These macros can be overridden if needed by defining them explicitly in your build system.

## 6. Compatibility Matrix and Further Details

For detailed version compatibility of compilers, platforms, and toolchains supported by GoogleTest, refer to Google's official [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

This matrix provides up-to-date authoritative data on compiler versions, operating system releases, and continuous integration environment compatibility.

---

## 7. Tips & Best Practices

- Always use recent C++17-compliant compilers; this avoids incompatibilities and builds failures.
- On Windows, explicitly set the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to match your runtime linkage.
- If you rely on specific features (like death tests or stream redirection), verify the platform supports these by checking corresponding macros.
- Use the **pkg-config** files provided with GoogleTest to streamline build integrations.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

| Issue                                    | Solution / Guidance                                     |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Build fails on older compilers           | Upgrade compiler to support at least C++17             |
| Link errors related to pthreads          | Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or ensure linking with pthread library |
| Runtime errors due to mismatched CRT linkage (Windows) | Enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake                |
| Features like death tests unavailable    | Confirm platform and macros support `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` |
| pkg-config can't find GoogleTest         | Ensure your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes GoogleTest pkg-config directory |

## 10. Summary

This page clarifies the technical foundational requirements for building and running GoogleTest reliably:

- A C++17-compliant compiler and CMake 3.13 or later
- Supported OS platforms include Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD, and select embedded targets
- Threading and runtime configurations can be controlled by compiler flags and CMake options

By ensuring your environment meets these criteria, you enable a smooth experience using GoogleTest and GoogleMock for your C++ testing needs.

---

### Troubleshooting

If problems arise related to system compatibility, consider these steps:

1. Verify compiler version supports C++17.
2. Confirm platform macro detection with debug logs or build flags.
3. Ensure pthread or equivalent threading libraries are present and linked if multithreading is needed.
4. On Windows, check CRT linkage consistency between GoogleTest and your project.
5. Consult the compatibility matrix and update your toolchain if necessary.
6. Use pkg-config or CMake `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` to avoid manual path and flag errors.

## Example: Checking GoogleTest Platform Macros

You can inspect the defined platform macros within your test runs by adding this snippet:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "gtest/internal/gtest-port-arch.h"

int main() {
#ifdef GTEST_OS_WINDOWS
    std::cout << "GoogleTest detected Windows platform." << std::endl;
#endif
#ifdef GTEST_OS_LINUX
    std::cout << "GoogleTest detected Linux platform." << std::endl;
#endif
// Add other platform macros as needed
    return 0;
}
```

Compile with your environment and confirm that your target platform is detected properly.
