# System Requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock

## Overview

Before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, it is critical to ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements to avoid compatibility issues. This page details the necessary C++ standard, supported compilers and platforms, threading support, and other environment factors essential for successful build and execution.

---

## 1. Required C++ Standard

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a C++17-compatible environment at minimum. This is a strict prerequisite:

- **Minimum Standard:** C++17 or later
- **Compliance Verification:** Your compiler must support at least C++17 features.

To ensure compliance in your build, set your compiler to use C++17 explicitly. For example, in CMake, add:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

> Attempting to build with a compiler configured for an earlier standard will fail, with errors generated during compile time.


## 2. Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).

For detailed platform and compiler versions, refer to the official compatibility matrix:

- [Google Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

### Common Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports mainstream platforms with stable support and frequent testing, including:

- Windows Desktop (including MSVC compiler)
- Linux (GCC, Clang)
- macOS
- Android

### Supported Compiler Versions Include (but are not limited to):

- GCC versions supporting C++17
- Clang versions supporting C++17
- MSVC Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later

> GoogleTest and GoogleMock explicitly require **MSVC 2015 (v14.0)** or later for GoogleMock.


## 3. Threading and Concurrency Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support. Thread-safety is automatic where supported.

- **POSIX Threads (pthread):** Supported on Linux, macOS, BSD, and others.
- **Windows Threads:** Windows Desktop support with native threading.
- Threading support can be forced or disabled using compile flags if auto-detection fails:

```bash
# Enable pthread support (force on)
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1

# Disable pthread support
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

If your platform lacks pthread support or disables threading, GoogleTest will build with minimal support and no thread safety guarantees.


## 4. Additional Environment and Feature Macros

GoogleTest detects and configures itself for your environment based on feature macros, which affect functionality such as:

- Exception handling (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`)
- Run-time type information (RTTI) (`GTEST_HAS_RTTI`)
- POSIX regular expressions (`GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`)
- File system availability (`GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`)

Users generally do not need to manually define these unless customizing builds or working on niche platforms.


## 5. Build System Compatibility

- GoogleTest is easily integrated with CMake and Bazel.
- When building with CMake, the GoogleTest repository includes native support and best practices to detect and apply system requirements.
- You can embed GoogleTest or include it via package managers if your platform and compiler match requirements.


## 6. Summary of Critical Requirements

| Requirement             | Details                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| C++ Standard           | C++17 or later                                       |
| Compiler Minimum       | MSVC 2015 (VS 14.0), GCC (versions with C++17), Clang |
| Supported OS           | Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, BSD, others per policy |
| Threading              | pthread or equivalent threading library supported   |
| Exception & RTTI       | Recommended enabled but not strictly required       |
| File System Access     | Required for death tests and some GoogleTest features |


## 7. Best Practices

- **Verify your toolchain:** Confirm compiler version and C++ standard before building.
- **Use CMake integration:** Sets standard and threads automatically.
- **Monitor compile-time warnings:** They help identify missing features or unsupported platform conditions.
- **Check feature macros:** Use these to troubleshoot feature availability.


## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<Tip>
If you encounter build errors related to the C++ standard, ensure your build system explicitly sets C++17 or above.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If threading-related failures occur, verify your platform supports pthread or the equivalent threading APIs. You can override with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` for single-threaded builds.
</Tip>

<Warning>
GoogleMock requires at least MSVC 2015 on Windows. Using older compilers will cause a build failure.
</Warning>
