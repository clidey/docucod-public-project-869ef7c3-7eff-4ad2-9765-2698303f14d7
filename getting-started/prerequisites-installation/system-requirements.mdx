# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment meets the necessary system prerequisites for successfully building and running GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page details supported compilers, required C++ standards, and compatible platforms, allowing you to validate your setup before proceeding with installation or integration.

---

## 1. Supported Compilers and Language Standards

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a compliant C++17 environment or later:

- **Minimum C++ standard:** C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017)
- GoogleTest will produce a compile-time error if compiled with a C++ version earlier than C++17.
- Compiler feature detection relies on standard macros such as `_MSVC_LANG` or `__cplusplus`.

### Notes about Compiler Support

- GoogleTest is confirmed to build with major compilers like GCC, Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later).
- Special compatibility flags are applied for Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) and Clang to optimize build and suppress warnings.
- There is explicit handling for exceptions and RTTI availability, as some environments may have them disabled.

### Recommended Compiler Settings

- Use compiler flags to enforce C++17, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang, or `/std:c++17` for MSVC.
- For MSVC, additional recommended flags include `-W4` for enhanced warning level, and `-utf-8` to treat source files as UTF-8 encoded.
- If building with exceptions disabled, set the appropriate defines (e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`).

---

## 2. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms. The most stable and well-tested include:

- Linux distributions
- Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio environment)
- macOS and iOS
- BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
- Various UNIX-like systems (Solaris, AIX)

GoogleTest aims to detect platform capabilities automatically, but you can override certain macros if necessary.

### Platform Detection Macros

GoogleTest uses internal macros to identify platforms automatically during build time. Examples include:

- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_CYGWIN` etc.

### Platform-Specific Considerations

- Some platforms may lack certain features such as POSIX regex or multithreading support.
- GoogleTest disables or adjusts features accordingly, e.g., stream redirection may be unsupported on embedded platforms.
- On Windows, wrappers exist to handle differences like path separators and exception handling.

For a comprehensive and up-to-date list of supported platforms, please refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) page.

## 3. Multithreading and Exceptions

### Thread Safety

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with POSIX threads or Windows threading APIs enabled.
- It attempts to detect threading capability via `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` or `GTEST_HAS_MUTEX_AND_THREAD_LOCAL_` macros.
- When pthreads or equivalent are not available, synchronization primitives become no-ops, and concurrent assertions are unsafe.

### Exception Support

- GoogleTest tries to auto-detect if exceptions are enabled through compiler-specific macros.
- If exceptions are disabled in your environment, you may need to define `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`.
- Exception handling impacts features such as death tests and typed tests.

---

## 4. Additional Feature Checks and Settings

### Wide String Support

- `std::wstring` availability varies by platform â€” disabled on some embedded platforms.
- Detected by `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING` macro.

### Regular Expression Support

- When compiled with Abseil and RE2, GoogleTest uses RE2 for regex support.
- Otherwise, POSIX Extended Regex or a simpler internal implementation is provided.

### Stream Redirection

- Supported except on some embedded platforms and those lacking a file system.

### Structured Exception Handling (SEH)

- Available on Microsoft compilers supporting SEH, primarily Windows.

### Build as Shared or Static Library

- Use `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to build GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows).
- When linking tests with a shared GoogleTest library, define `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

## 5. Summary Table of Key Requirements

| Requirement                         | Details                         |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| C++ Standard                      | C++17 minimum                  |
| Supported OS                     | Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD, UNIX|
| Threading Support                | Requires pthreads or Windows API|
| Exception Handling               | Optional, recommended           |
| Wide String (std::wstring)       | Platform-dependent             |
| Regex Implementation             | RE2 (with Abseil) or POSIX     |
| Build Options                   | Static or Shared Library Support|

## 6. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Build errors related to C++ standard:** Verify compiler flags include `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
- **Missing pthread symbols:** Ensure pthread libraries are linked or define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if unavailable.
- **Issues with RTTI or exceptions:** Confirm your build environment has RTTI and exceptions enabled or inform GoogleTest with macro defines.
- **Unexpected platform macro:** Override detection macros in your build script if GoogleTest misdetects your environment.

---

## 7. Next Steps

After confirming your environment meets these requirements:

- Proceed to the [Install with CMake](../prerequisites-installation/install-cmake.md) guide for building GoogleTest.
- Review the [Configure Your Project](../basic-setup-first-test/configure-project.md) page to integrate GoogleTest into your C++ testing workflow.
- Consult the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation for details on platform-specific nuances.

## Example Compiler Check Snippet

Here is a small example of how GoogleTest enforces C++17 during compilation:

```cpp
#if !defined(__cplusplus) || __cplusplus < 201703L
#error "C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported."
#endif
```

Ensuring this check passes is crucial for successful compilation and operation.
