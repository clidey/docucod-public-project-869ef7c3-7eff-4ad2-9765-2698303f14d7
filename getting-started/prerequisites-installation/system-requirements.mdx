# System Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a compatible development environment that supports modern C++17 standards and is built on platforms with reliable threading and compiler support. This page details the supported platforms, compilers, and C++ standards to ensure a smooth setup experience before you begin integrating these testing frameworks.

## 1. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and supports a wide range of platforms. Below are the primary platforms tested and supported:

- **Windows** (including Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, and WinRT variations)
- **Linux** (including Android)
- **macOS** and **iOS**
- **BSD Variants** (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **QNX**
- Other Unix-like platforms: GNU/Hurd, Haiku, Fuchsia

GoogleTest also supports embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, Xtensa, and others, though with some limitations detailed in their respective documentation.

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler that fully supports **C++17** or later. The following compiler toolchains and versions are supported:

- **GCC**: version 7.0 or later
- **Clang**: version 3.4.1 or later
- **MSVC**: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later
- **Intel LLVM**: compatible versions supporting C++17
- **SunPro**, **IBM VisualAge**, **HP aCC**, and other compilers with C++17 support

### Notes:

- GoogleTest internally requires C++17 features; the project will fail to build with earlier standards.
- The build uses `target_compile_features` in CMake to enforce C++17 standard.
- For projects without native C++17, you can pass the standard flag manually (e.g., `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`) to your build system.

---

## 3. Threading and Concurrency Support

GoogleTest depends on threading support for safe parallel test execution and features such as death tests.

- When pthread support is available (on Linux, macOS, and Unix variants), GoogleTest enables multi-threaded safe operations automatically.
- On Windows, native threading primitives are used.
- For environments lacking pthread support or with limited threading capabilities (some embedded systems), GoogleTest can be configured to disable threading.

### Important Build Flags Related to Threading:

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`: Automatically detected or can be manually defined to toggle pthread usage.
- `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to force thread support on/off.

The CMake build system includes auto-discovery of thread libraries and links them as needed.

## 4. C++ Standard and Build System Notes

### C++17 Requirement

It is mandatory that your development environment supports C++17. You can ensure this by:

- Setting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to `17` and `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` to `ON` in your `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Manually adding `-std=c++17` or an equivalent flag to your compiler options if you are not using CMake.

### Build System Integration

- **CMake** is the recommended build system for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It supports multiple platforms and compilers in a unified way.
- When using CMake, GoogleTest can be built as a standalone project or embedded into an existing project.
- For Visual Studio users, GoogleTest supports out-of-the-box generation of project files and solutions compatible with MSVC.

---

## 5. Additional Compatibility Considerations

### Runtime Libraries on Windows

- By default, GoogleTest links the C runtime libraries statically (`/MT`), which can conflict with projects that use dynamic CRT (`/MD`).
- You can override this behavior with the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt`:
  
  ```bash
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

This ensures GoogleTest uses dynamic runtime libraries compatible with your project.

### Exception and RTTI Support

- GoogleTest detects exception and RTTI support automatically.
- It requires exception handling to be enabled for tests that rely on exceptions.
- RTTI is used internally for features like typed tests and safe downcasting.

If your compiler disables RTTI or exceptions, GoogleTest will attempt to work accordingly but some features may be unavailable.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Ensure your compiler fully supports C++17 before building GoogleTest.** Older compilers, even if they compile, may cause subtle runtime errors.
- **Confirm threading support is detected correctly.** If you encounter linker errors related to `pthread`, define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to disable pthread or configure your build to link pthread libraries properly.
- **Use the CMake build scripts whenever possible,** as they auto-configure compiler flags and system dependencies for you.
- **For Windows users:** consider enabling `gtest_force_shared_crt` when your project uses dynamic CRT to avoid linkage errors.

---

## 7. Verifying Your Environment Compatibility

Run the following to check your compiler's C++ version:

```bash
${CXX} --version
${CXX} -std=c++17 -dM -E - < /dev/null | grep __cplusplus
```

Expected output should indicate a value `>= 201703L`.

Use CMake's configuration step to verify that necessary threading libraries and features are detected:

```bash
cmake ..
```

Check output for lines indicating pthread or Windows threading usage.

If you encounter issues preparing your environment or building GoogleTest:

- Ensure you have the latest stable compiler matching the minimum versions.
- Confirm CMake version is 3.14 or higher for full compatibility.
- Review platform-specific quirks in [Platform Support](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/platforms.md).
- Seek community support via GoogleTest forums or issue trackers.
