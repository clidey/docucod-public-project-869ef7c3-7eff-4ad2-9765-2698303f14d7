# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Learn about the minimum C++ standards, compilers, platforms, and tools required for using GoogleTest. This page also maps compatible environments based on the supported C++ versions and lists community-validated platforms to ensure reliability.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires an environment supporting at least **C++17** to build and function correctly. This minimum standard ensures the framework leverages modern language features for robustness and maintainability.

### Key Points:
- The C++ version detection is automatic and checked during compilation.
- If your build environment does not meet this minimum standard, compilation will fail with an error.

### Recommended Setup:
- Specify the C++ standard in your build system explicitly, for example, in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- Alternatively, if your build system does not natively support setting the C++ standard, pass the appropriate compiler flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang).

> <Note>Attempting to build GoogleTest with a C++ version older than C++17 triggers a compile-time error, preventing incompatible builds early.</Note>

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest is verified to build and run on a range of modern C++ compilers that support the required features of C++17. These include:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), version 7.0 and above.
- Clang, version 3.4.1 and above.
- Microsoft Visual C++, version 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) and above.
- Intel compilers compatible with C++17.
- Other compilers supporting modern C++17 standards may work but require user validation.

### Compiler Flags and Macros

- GoogleTest internally adjusts warning and optimization flags to maintain strictness and avoid runtime incompatibilities.
- On MSVC, GoogleTest suppresses some warnings and ensures UTF-8 encoding flags for source files.
- On GCC and Clang, warnings are adjusted for stricter checks without breaking build.

### Troubleshooting Compiler Issues

- If your compiler version is below the supported threshold, upgrade it to avoid undefined behavior or build failures.
- Use the supplied CMake scripts as they automatically detect and apply needed flags.

## 3. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest maintains broad platform compatibility, validated by the community and core contributors. The primary tested platforms are:

- **Linux** (including various distributions, emphasizing stable glibc versions).
- **Windows Desktop** (via MSVC, MinGW, and Cygwin environments).
- **Mac OS X** (including Xcode toolchain).

Other community-validated and less common platforms include:

- BSD variants: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD.
- IBM AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, z/OS.
- Android (Linux-based, with minimum API level requirements).

### Special Notes:

- Some platforms lack full filesystem support or threading APIs.
- Death tests may be unsupported on some embedded or mobile OS platforms.

> <Tip>Platform support is indicated via preprocessor macros, such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC`. These macros also enable platform-specific features or disable unsupported functionality.</Tip>

## 4. Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest is designed to be thread-safe on platforms supporting pthreads or Windows threading API.

- Pthreads support macro: `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`. It is automatically detected but can be overridden.
- Windows threading is supported on desktop versions.

### Thread safety features include:
- Mutexes and thread-local storage abstractions.
- Notification primitives (if supported by the environment).

> <Warning>On platforms without threading support, GoogleTest compiles with dummy synchronization primitives, disabling thread safety. Running multi-threaded tests with GoogleTest on such platforms is unsafe and unsupported.</Warning>

## 5. Filesystem and Stream Capabilities

- GoogleTest requires a filesystem to support key test features such as death tests.
- Stream redirection support is enabled on platforms where file descriptors and dup/dup2 are supported.

Platforms lacking these capabilities disable relevant features automatically.

## 6. Using GoogleTest as Shared or Static Libraries

You can build and link GoogleTest as either:

- A **static library** (default and simplest for most users).
- A **shared library** (DLL on Windows).

### Recommendations:
- For shared libraries, define `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building GoogleTest itself.
- For tests linking against the shared GoogleTest library, define `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

This clarifies linkage semantics and ensures symbol visibility matches the platform.

## 7. Community-Validated Platforms and Compatibility Matrix

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) for long-term platform support.

Refer to the official [support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for the current list of supported compilers, platforms, and build tools.

## 8. Summary Table of Macros Indicating Platform and Feature Support

| Feature / Platform                          | Macro                      | Value Meaning                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Threading support (Pthreads availability) | `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`        | 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled                              |
| POSIX regular expressions                  | `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`       | 1 = available, 0 = not available                        |
| Full death test support                     | `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`     | 1 = enabled (depends on OS and filesystem)             |
| C++ RTTI enabled                           | `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`           | 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled                              |
| Standard wide string support               | `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`    | 1 = supported, 0 = not supported                        |
| Filesystem availability                    | `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`    | 1 = available, 0 = not available                        |
| Stream redirection support                  | `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` | 1 = supported, 0 = not supported                 |
| Platform identification                    | `GTEST_OS_<platform>`      | Defined (1) if compiled on the given platform          |

## 9. Best Practices and Tips

- Always use the official CMake scripts included with GoogleTest to ensure proper detection of platform features and compiler flags.
- Override feature macros only if you understand your platform’s capabilities and limitations.
- Consult community resources and issue trackers if you encounter platform-specific problems.
- Validate you have the minimum C++17 compiler support before proceeding to integration.

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build errors related to C++ standard

- Verify your compiler supports C++17.
- Explicitly set the standard in your build system.
- On MSVC, update to at least Visual Studio 2017 Update 3.

### Missing pthread support

- On Linux/macOS, ensure `pthread` is accessible.
- Use CMake's `find_package(Threads)` or manually link with pthread if needed.

### Incomplete platform support

- On embedded or non-mainstream platforms, some GoogleTest features may be unavailable, such as death tests or stream redirection.

### Example: Setting the C++ Standard in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTestProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_subdirectory(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_tests)
```

By specifying the standard explicitly, you ensure a successful GoogleTest build.
