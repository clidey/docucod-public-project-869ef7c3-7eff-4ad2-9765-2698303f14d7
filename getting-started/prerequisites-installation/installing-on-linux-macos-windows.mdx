# Installation: Linux, macOS, and Windows

Welcome to the installation guide for GoogleTest and GoogleMock on Linux, macOS, and Windows. This page provides you with clear, step-by-step instructions to build, install, and integrate GoogleTest into your C++ projects using the preferred build tools such as CMake and Bazel. Whether you are setting up from a fresh environment or integrating into an existing project, this guide will get you up and running swiftly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing GoogleTest, ensure your system meets the following:

- **Supported Operating Systems:** Linux, macOS, Windows (Desktop and MinGW supported)
- **Compiler:** C++ compiler supporting at least C++17 standard
- **Build Tools:** CMake (version 3.14 or newer is recommended)
- **Network Access:** Required for cloning the repository or downloading source
- **Permissions:** Administrator or sudo privileges for global install (optional)

### Notes:
- Windows users with Visual Studio must ensure their environment variables and paths are set to use MSVC or MinGW compilers correctly.
- On Linux/macOS, standard GNU or Clang-based toolchains are supported.

<Tip>
If you do not have CMake installed, download it from [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/) prior to proceeding.
</Tip>

## 2. Obtaining the Source Code

GoogleTest comes as part of the `googletest` repository, which also includes GoogleMock.

**Clone the repository with:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
```

Switch to the folder:

```bash
cd googletest
```

---

## 3. Building and Installing with CMake

GoogleTest provides a flexible CMake build that works across supported platforms.

### Step 1: Create a Build Directory
Create a subdirectory for building the project to keep things organized.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

### Step 2: Generate Build Files
Invoke CMake to generate native build files for your platform.

```bash
cmake ..
```

- To build **only GoogleTest** (exclude GoogleMock), use:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

- To enable shared libraries or other options, customize the CMake command accordingly.

### Step 3: Build the Project

On Linux/macOS:

```bash
make
```

On Windows (using Visual Studio generated files):
- Open the generated solution `gtest.sln` and build.

### Step 4: (Optional) Install GoogleTest and GoogleMock System-wide

If you want to use GoogleTest as a system-wide library:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This step requires sufficient permissions and installs headers and libraries under `/usr/local/` by default.

<Tip>
Installing is optional if you plan to vendor GoogleTest directly in your project.
</Tip>

## 4. Using GoogleTest in Your Projects

### Including GoogleTest

- After installation, include GoogleTest headers with `#include <gtest/gtest.h>`.
- When building your tests, link against `gtest` and optionally `gmock` libraries.

### Linking with CMake

If you use CMake, find and link GoogleTest with:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_test_target GTest::gtest GTest::gmock)
```

For GoogleTest only:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_test_target GTest::gtest)
```

<Tip>
Embedding GoogleTest as a submodule or subproject and adding it with `add_subdirectory()` ensures consistent compiler settings.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Alternative Build Systems: Bazel

If you use Bazel as a build tool, GoogleTest can be integrated via external repositories.
- Follow the Bazel instructions on the [official googletest GitHub page](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- Use the Bazel BUILD files provided to bring in `@com_google_googletest//:gtest`.

---

## 6. Verification and First Test Build

After building and linking GoogleTest, verify your setup by compiling and running the example tests included.

For example:

```bash
./build/gtest/gtest
```

You should see output indicating tests ran successfully.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Installation Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="CMake Not Found or Version Too Low">
Make sure CMake is installed and accessible in your PATH. Check version with:

```bash
cmake --version
```

Upgrade to at least version 3.14 if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors on Windows">
Ensure you use a supported Visual Studio version (2015 or newer) or MinGW.
Set environment variables appropriately, and consider using the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Cannot Find GoogleTest Libraries">
- Verify the install path or library path is correctly specified in your build system.
- If GoogleTest is built as static libraries, ensure linking order is correct.
- Check for mismatch in runtime libraries (dynamic vs static) on Windows.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Fail to Run or Detect">
- Confirm that you linked with gtest_main or provided your own main function.
- Check that `InitGoogleTest()` is called in your test executable.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Use `-DBUILD_GMOCK=ON` to build gMock alongside GoogleTest if mocking is needed.
- Prefer embedding GoogleTest as a subdirectory in your project for consistent builds.
- Use the `find_package(GTest)` method in CMake for simplicity when installed system-wide.
- Always ensure your compiler supports C++17 or newer as GoogleTest requires it.
