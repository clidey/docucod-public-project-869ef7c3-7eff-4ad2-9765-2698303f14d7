# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is a robust C++ testing and mocking framework designed to work seamlessly across various platforms and compilers. Before integrating GoogleTest into your project, it’s essential to understand the compilers, C++ standards, and operating systems that it supports, as well as any compatibility considerations or constraints.

---

## 1. Supported Compilers and Language Standards

GoogleTest is built to maintain broad compatibility across popular C++ compilers. The framework evolves with modern language standards but continues to support older, widely-used environments.

- **Compilers Supported:**
  - GCC
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
  - Intel C++ Compiler
  - Other common C++ compilers compliant with the C++11 standard and above

- **Minimum C++ Standard:**
  - GoogleTest requires **at least C++11** for full functionality.
  - It takes advantage of several C++11 and later features for modern and efficient implementation.

- **Version Considerations:**
  - For the latest features and improved compatibility, newer compiler versions are recommended.
  - Older compiler versions supporting only pre-C++11 standards may lack full GoogleTest support.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is platform-agnostic and supports a variety of operating systems commonly used in C++ development environments:

- **Supported OS Platforms:**
  - Linux distributions
  - macOS
  - Windows (including modern versions with MSVC support)
  - BSD variants
  - Unix-like systems

- **Platform Constraints:**
  - Some functionality, such as threading and system-specific features, may depend on OS-level services available in these environments.
  - For embedded systems or less common platforms, manual verification for compatibility is recommended.

---

## 3. System Requirements

While GoogleTest is lightweight, ensure your development environment meets the following minimal recommendations:

- **Operating System:** As indicated in supported OS platforms above
- **Compiler:** A C++11 compatible compiler (see Section 1)
- **Memory:** Minimal; typical of development environments for C++ applications
- **Disk Space:** Minimal, mainly for the GoogleTest source and binaries

---

## 4. Integration and Compatibility Tips

- **Compatibility with Build Systems:**
  GoogleTest integrates nicely with popular C++ build systems like Bazel and CMake.

- **Cross-Platform Build:**
  To support multiple platforms, configure your build scripts to handle platform-specific compiler flags and dependencies.

- **Version Synchronization:**
  Keep your GoogleTest version updated to ensure compatibility with the latest compiler versions and OS updates.

- **Runtime Environment:**
  Ensure that runtime environments match the compiler and system standards to avoid subtle runtime issues.

## 5. Staying Up to Date

- Follow the official [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) to track releases and compatibility updates.
- Review release notes for new features, compiler support changes, or platform-specific fixes.
- Consult [Integration and Supported Workflows](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/overview/arch-diagram-integration/integration-and-workflows.md) for adjustments on build tools and environments.

---

> By ensuring your compiler and platform meet these requirements, you set a solid foundation for successfully building, integrating, and running tests using GoogleTest.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter compatibility problems:

- Verify that your compiler supports C++11 (or higher) and that relevant flags are enabled (e.g., `-std=c++11` for GCC/Clang).
- Check for OS-specific known issues or limitations in the official GoogleTest documentation.
- Review compiler error messages related to GoogleTest headers to isolate unsupported constructs.

<Tip>
If you integrate GoogleTest with continuous integration systems, ensure your build agents use supported OS and compiler versions to prevent unexpected failures.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid mixing incompatible compiler versions or C++ standards within one project, as this can cause linker errors or runtime instability when using GoogleTest.
