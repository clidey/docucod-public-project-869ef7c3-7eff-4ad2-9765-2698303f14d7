# Requirements and Supported Platforms

This page provides a clear overview of the minimum system and environment requirements for using GoogleTest effectively. It covers the necessary compiler standards, supported operating systems, and environment considerations. Ensuring your platform meets these requirements upfront will smooth your installation and development experience.

---

## 1. Minimum Compiler and C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++17 compliant environment to build and run properly. This ensures access to modern language features and library support critical for GoogleTest’s internal implementation.

- **C++ Standard:**
  - Must support **C++17** or later.
  - To enforce this in your build system, set:

    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```

  - Alternatively, for command-line builds, add compiler flags like `-std=c++17`.

- **Compiler Compatibility:**
  - GCC 7.0 or newer
  - Clang 5.0 or newer
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
  - Intel Compiler (compatible versions supporting C++17)

- **Exception Support:**
  - GoogleTest requires exception support enabled in the compiler.
  - Disabling exceptions can break some GoogleTest features.


<Tip>
If your compiler does not support C++17, GoogleTest cannot be reliably used. Upgrade your compiler or toolchain first.
</Tip>


## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be highly portable and supports a wide range of operating systems, including desktop, server, and embedded platforms.

- **Desktop and Server Platforms:**
  - Linux (full support on major distributions)
  - macOS
  - Windows Desktop (Win32/64, Windows Store/WinRT apps with some limitations)
  - FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, IBM z/OS

- **Embedded and Specialized Platforms:**
  - Android (as a Linux derivative)
  - iOS
  - Embedded RTOSes such as QNX, Native Client, Fuchsia, and others with partial support

- **Windows Variants:**
  - Windows Mobile platforms have limited support and some missing features.

The exact platform detection is handled internally by GoogleTest via predefined macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`).


## 3. Threading and Platform Features

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where the pthreads library is available.
- Platforms with native threading (e.g., Windows) have corresponding synchronization implementations.
- On mobile or embedded platforms lacking full thread or file system support, some GoogleTest features (like stream redirection or death tests) may be disabled.


## 4. File System and Stream Support

- GoogleTest assumes the presence of a functional file system.
- On platforms without file system support (e.g., some embedded environments), features such as death tests and stream redirection are unavailable.


## 5. Compiler Flags and Build Considerations

- **Building as a Shared or Static Library:**
  - You can build GoogleTest as a static library (default) or shared library.
  - To build a shared library, add the flag: `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.
  - To link tests against a shared library of GoogleTest, add `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

- **Macro Customization:**
  - You can tweak GoogleTest behaviors and avoid macro conflicts via compiler macro definitions.
  - For instance, to rename GoogleTest macros to avoid clashes:

    ```bash
    -DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
    ```

    In this mode, use prefixed macros like `GTEST_TEST()` instead of `TEST()`.

- **Thread Support Macros:**

    ```bash
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1   # Force-enable pthread support
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0   # Force-disable pthread support
    ```

- **Visual Studio Runtime Compatibility:**
  - When building with Visual Studio, ensure consistent runtime library linking.
  - Use CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to force GoogleTest to match your project’s runtime linkage.


## 6. Verifying Your Environment Compatibility

To verify if your environment meets the requirements:

1. **Confirm your compiler version** supports C++17.

2. **Check your target platform** is in the list of supported OSes.

3. **Ensure exception handling is enabled** in your compiler settings.

4. **Confirm presence of pthreads or Windows threading** support if your tests are multithreaded.

5. **Build GoogleTest with verbose output** to detect any warnings about unsupported features.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<Accordion title="Common Pitfalls and Solutions">

### GoogleTest Fails to Build Due to Compiler Version

- Ensure your compiler supports C++17 by running:

  ```bash
  <compiler> --version
  ```

- Upgrade to a newer compiler if necessary.

### Missing Exception Support Errors

- Verify exceptions are enabled (e.g., `-fexceptions` for GCC/Clang, `/EHsc` for MSVC).

### Threading Support Not Detected

- On Unix-like platforms, ensure `pthread` development libraries are installed.
- For CMake builds, verify `find_package(Threads)` detects pthread.
- You can override detection using `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `=0`.

### Macro Conflicts When Including Multiple Libraries

- Use `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` and corresponding prefixed macros if you face macro name collisions.

### Runtime Library Conflicts on Windows

- Use CMake’s `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to enforce consistent linking against the CRT.

### Features Disabled on Embedded Platforms

- Some GoogleTest features require file system and threading support; these may be limited or disabled on embedded RTOS.
- Check platform-specific macros and documentation for additional instructions.
