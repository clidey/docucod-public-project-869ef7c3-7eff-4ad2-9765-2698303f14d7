# Installation Overview

GoogleTest offers flexible installation options tailored to your needs, whether you're seeking a quick setup via package managers or full control utilizing manual builds. This overview guides you through fetching the source code, basic setup alternatives, and acquaints you with the repository's structure, empowering you to choose the path that best fits your project requirements.

---

## 1. Fetching the Code

Start by obtaining the latest GoogleTest source code from the official GitHub repository. This ensures you have the latest features and fixes.

### Steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository with the main branch
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
cd googletest
```

This command clones the entire GoogleTest repository including GoogleMock, as GoogleMock is integrated and maintained alongside GoogleTest.

### Repository Layout:

- `googletest/`: Contains the GoogleTest framework source code and headers.
- `googlemock/`: Contains GoogleMock framework source code and headers.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: The main build configuration file for CMake builds.
- `README.md`: Overview and additional info about GoogleMock.

<Tip>
Cloning the full repository is recommended even if you only plan to use GoogleTest, because some build configurations and dependency setups expect both folders present.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Methods Overview

Depending on your platform and build tool preference, you may choose one of the following installation options:

### 2.1 Package Manager (Quick Setup)

Some platforms offer GoogleTest as a pre-packaged library, drastically reducing setup time.

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
  ```
  *Note*: This installs headers and source. You'll still need to build the library manually by navigating to `/usr/src/gtest` and building it.

- **vcpkg** (Windows/Linux/macOS): 
  ```bash
  vcpkg install gtest
  ```

- **Conan**:
  Add GoogleTest as a dependency in your `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py`.

<Tip>
Package managers are your fastest route if you just want to run tests without customization.
</Tip>

---

### 2.2 Manual Build from Source (Complete Control)

This approach provides the most flexibility and is necessary if you want to customize compile options, enable or disable GoogleMock, or integrate tightly with your build system.

#### Building with CMake

1. Navigate to the root of the cloned repository.
2. Create a build directory to keep generated files separate:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Generate build files with CMake:

- To build **GoogleTest and GoogleMock** 

```bash
cmake ..
```

- To build **only GoogleTest** (disable GoogleMock):

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

4. Build the libraries:

```bash
cmake --build .
```

5. (Optional) Install libraries and headers system-wide:

```bash
sudo cmake --install .
```

<Tip>
You can customize build types (Debug/Release) and other options by passing standard CMake flags such as `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
</Tip>

#### Alternative Build Systems

- GoogleTest supports other build systems like Bazel with dedicated instructions elsewhere in our docs.

## 3. Repository Structure Orientation

Understanding the layout will help maximize your efficiency integrating GoogleTest.

| Folder/File           | Purpose                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `googletest/`          | Contains GoogleTest source code and headers          |
| `googlemock/`          | Contains GoogleMock source code and headers          |
| `CMakeLists.txt`       | Main CMake project configuration                      |
| `README.md`            | Overview and details about GoogleMock                 |

<Tip>
Most users only need to include headers from these directories and link against the libraries built via CMake.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Verification After Installation

Confirm your build and install completed successfully by compiling and running the included sample tests.

For example, you can create a simple program:

```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and link with GoogleTest libraries, then run the executable. It should run the simple test and report success.

---

## 5. Choosing Your Path

- **Need a fast proof-of-concept or CI integration?**
  Use the package manager installation for quick results.

- **Require control over build options or want to debug tests?**
  Clone the repo and build manually using CMake.

- **Using other build systems?**
  Refer to the specific build system integration pages for detailed instructions.

---

## 6. Tips & Best Practices

- Always run `InitGoogleTest` before executing tests to initialize the framework properly.
- If using GoogleMock, initialize with `InitGoogleMock`, which also initializes GoogleTest.
- Keep GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions synchronized to avoid compatibility issues.
- Use C++17 or later compilers as GoogleTest requires C++17 features.

<Tip>
If you encounter linker errors related to the runtime library on Windows, consider setting the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to harmonize runtime linkage.
</Tip>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Issue: Missing pthreads or thread support errors">
GoogleTest requires pthreads on POSIX systems for thread safety.

**Solution:**

- Ensure your compiler and linker flags include `-pthread`.
- When using CMake, this is handled automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issue: Linker errors due to mismatched runtime libraries on Windows">
Mismatch between static and dynamic CRT libraries can cause linker failures.

**Solution:**

- Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` during configuration.
- This aligns GoogleTest's runtime linkage to dynamic CRT, matching typical Visual Studio projects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Issue: GoogleMock not found or build fails when disabling it">
GoogleMock is integrated but can be disabled if only GoogleTest is desired.

**Solution:**

- Use `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` with CMake to disable GoogleMock.
- If linking errors arise, ensure your test code does not depend on GoogleMock symbols.
</Accordion>
