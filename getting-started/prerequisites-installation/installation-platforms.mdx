# Installation (All Platforms)

Follow these clear and detailed instructions to install GoogleTest on your development platform. Whether you are using Linux, macOS, or Windows, this guide walks you through the most common installation paths including CMake-based builds, Bazel integration, and manual source compilation. By the end, you will have GoogleTest ready to integrate into your C++ testing workflows.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Environment Preparation

Before starting the installation, ensure your system meets the following:

- **Supported Operating Systems:** Linux, macOS, Windows (desktop editions including Visual Studio environments).
- **Compiler:** A C++ compiler compatible with C++17 standard (gcc 7+, clang 5+, MSVC 2017 Update 3+).
- **CMake:** Version 3.14 or later is required for the standard build process.
- **Bazel:** Optional, if you prefer using Bazel as your build system.
- **Network Connection:** For cloning from GitHub or downloading source archives.

<Tip>
Ensure your development environment supports C++17 as GoogleTest requires it to build correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Methods

### A. Building with CMake (Recommended)

GoogleTest provides a robust CMake build script supporting multiple platforms and configurations.

#### Step-by-Step Installation via CMake

1. **Clone GoogleTest Repository**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
  cd googletest
```

2. **Create a Build Directory**

```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
```

3. **Generate Build Files**

- To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock (default):

```bash
  cmake ..
```

- To build only GoogleTest (skip Mock):

```bash
  cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

4. **Build the Libraries**

- On Linux/macOS:

```bash
  make
```

- On Windows (Visual Studio):

Open the generated solution file (e.g., `gtest.sln`) in Visual Studio and build.

5. **(Optional) Install System-Wide**

This requires administrative privileges:

```bash
  sudo make install
```

or use the equivalent install commands in your environment.

<Check>
After build, verify the presence of `libgtest.a`, `libgmock.a` or their `.lib` equivalents under build directories.
</Check>

<Tip>
Enabling `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake is essential when integrating with Visual Studio projects that use dynamic CRT to avoid runtime library mismatches.
</Tip>

---

### B. Using Bazel Build System

GoogleTest supports Bazel, Google's fast build system, for users who prefer this workflow.

#### Installation Steps:

1. **Clone repository** (same as previous CMake steps).

2. **Build tests with Bazel**:

```bash
  bazel build //...
```

3. **Run tests**:

```bash
  bazel test //...
```

---

### C. Manual Source Compilation

For environments without CMake or Bazel, or for quick tests, you can manually compile GoogleTest source files.

#### Steps:

1. **Download source code** and place it along with your test files.

2. **Compile GoogleTest sources:**

Include `gtest/gtest-all.cc` and optionally `gmock/gmock-all.cc` in your build commands.

Example with `g++`:

```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -isystem googletest/include -pthread your_test.cc \
  googletest/src/gtest-all.cc -o your_test
```

3. **Run your test executable:**

```bash
  ./your_test
```

<Warning>
Manual compilation requires explicit linking of pthread on Unix-like platforms (use `-pthread`). On Windows, ensure you link against appropriate runtime libraries.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, validating GoogleTest is crucial.

- Run sample or existing tests that use GoogleTest libraries.
- Successful execution typically shows output like:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] ExampleTest.DoesSomething
[       OK ] ExampleTest.DoesSomething (0 ms)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

- If tests fail to run or link, re-check dependencies, compiler settings, and library paths.

---

## 4. Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux/macOS

- Use `make` or supported build systems.
- Ensure `pthread` is linked.
- Use the command-line tools `cmake` or `bazel` for easier builds.

### Windows

- Visual Studio users can load the generated solution from CMake.
- Pay attention to dynamic vs static runtime linking. Set option `gtest_force_shared_crt` when needed.
- Use native Windows threading and synchronization (handled automatically by GoogleTest).

<Tip>
If using MinGW or Cygwin, verify that threading libraries and POSIX compatibility are functioning.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Missing pthread">
If your build fails referencing pthread functions:

- Make sure you pass `-pthread` flag during compilation and linking.
- On CMake, this is usually handled automatically if threads package is found.
- Example fix:

```bash
  g++ -pthread ...
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Errors Related to CRT Mismatch on Windows">
- Enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to match runtime libraries.
- Ensure all projects link with the same CRT type (static or dynamic).

Example:

```bash
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Do Not Run, No Output">
- Check that the main() function is correctly linked. Use `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` if you prefer an automatic main().
- If you write your own main(), ensure `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` or `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` is called.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Uses Older C++ Standard">
- Verify CMake or build system uses at least C++17.
- Set CMake variables:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
