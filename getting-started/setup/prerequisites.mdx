# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This section details the minimal toolchain, compiler standards, and platform support required to successfully build and run GoogleTest. Understanding these requirements ensures a smooth setup, helps avoid incompatibilities, and prepares you for integrating GoogleTest into your C++ testing workflow.

---

## 1. Toolchain and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest is a modern C++ testing framework and requires a C++17-compliant compiler to build and run effectively. The following outlines the essential compiler and build tools you must have installed.

### Supported Compilers

- **GCC**: Version 7.0 or newer
- **Clang**: Version 5.0 or newer
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio)**: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later
- **Intel Compilers**: Recent versions that fully support C++17

### C++ Language Standard

GoogleTest mandates building with the **C++17** standard enabled. If you manage your project via CMake, set the following in your `CMakeLists.txt` to ensure proper language version enforcement:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

This guarantees consistent compatibility across compilers.

### CMake Version

A minimum **CMake version 3.14** is required when using the built-in `FetchContent` approach to download and build GoogleTest as part of your project.

If you use CMake for standalone building or integration, ensure your environment has this version or higher.

### Bazel Version

If you prefer Bazel for building GoogleTest, ensure you are using a compatible Bazel release, generally **version 3.0 or later**. For exact compatibility, refer to the [Bazel Compatibility Guidelines](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-overview.html).


## 2. Operating System and Platform Support

GoogleTest supports building and running on a wide range of platforms. This cross-platform compatibility ensures you can maintain a unified test suite across different development and deployment environments.

### Officially Supported Platforms

- **Linux** (most distributions)
- **Windows** (desktop environments using MSVC or MinGW)
- **Mac OS X**

### Embedded and Special Platforms

GoogleTest includes support for some embedded systems such as ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52 with Arduino environments, albeit with specialized setup.

### Threading and Concurrency Considerations

Where available, GoogleTest uses pthreads for thread safety and parallel test execution. On Windows, native threading APIs are used.

If pthreads are unavailable or disabled (`-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`), thread safety may be limited.

### Filesystem and Stream Redirection

GoogleTest requires filesystem support for features like output capture and death tests.

Certain embedded platforms or minimal OS environments that lack filesystem capabilities may restrict some GoogleTest features.

## 3. Dependencies and Environment Setup

### Required Libraries

- None explicitly needed beyond standard C++17 library support and optionally pthreads for threading.

### Threading Library

- On Unix-like systems, ensure pthreads is installed and linked. This is typically included in most standard distributions.

- On Windows, the native threading model is used.

### Network and Access

- Internet access is not required to build or run GoogleTest.

- If using `FetchContent` in CMake or other automated fetching, internet access may be needed at build time.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Caveats

- **Compiler Compatibility**: Using an unsupported or older compiler will cause build failures or runtime issues. Verify compiler version before building.

- **CMake Version**: Older versions of CMake may not support necessary features like `FetchContent_MakeAvailable`.

- **Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows**: When linking GoogleTest with MSVC, mismatches of dynamic vs static runtime libraries can cause linker errors. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option in such cases.

- **Thread Safety**: On some platforms without pthread support, GoogleTest is not thread-safe.

- **Embedded Platforms**: Some features (e.g. death tests, stream capturing) may not be available or fully functional on constrained or embedded devices.

## Summary

To build and run GoogleTest:

- Use a C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+).
- Have a compatible build system: CMake 3.14+, or Bazel 3.x+.
- Build on supported OS platforms: Linux, Windows, Mac OS.
- Ensure the presence of pthreads on Unix-like platforms for thread safety.
- Pay attention to runtime library settings on Windows with MSVC.

Following these requirements ensures predictable and successful builds and lets you leverage GoogleTest's powerful automated testing features.
