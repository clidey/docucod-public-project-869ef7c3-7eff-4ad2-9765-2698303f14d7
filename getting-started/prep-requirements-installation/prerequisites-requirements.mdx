# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the minimum system, compiler, and language requirements necessary to use GoogleTest reliably. Ensuring your development environment meets these requirements guarantees a smooth installation and successful execution of your first test.

---

## 1. Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest is a C++ testing framework that depends on features provided by modern C++ compilers. Make sure your compiler supports the C++11 standard as a minimum prerequisite.

### Supported Compilers

- GCC (g++): Version 4.8 or higher
- Clang: Version 3.3 or higher
- MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio): Visual Studio 2015 or later
- Apple Clang: Corresponding versions supporting C++11 features

### Language Features Required

| Feature                                   | Description                                                |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| C++11 Support                             | Usage of lambdas, auto keyword, move semantics, etc.       |
| Exception Handling                        | Required for GoogleTest internals and error reporting      |
| RTTI (Run-Time Type Information)         | Enabled for certain GoogleTest functionalities              |

<Note>
Ensure your compiler's flags enable C++11 or newer standards. For GCC and Clang, use `-std=c++11` or later. For MSVC, select the appropriate project settings (Visual Studio 2015 and onward defaults to at least C++11 support).
</Note>

## 2. System Requirements

GoogleTest builds and runs comfortably on a wide range of development platforms. To achieve a smooth experience:

### Operating Systems

- Linux distributions (most modern)
- Windows (via Visual Studio or MSYS2/MinGW)
- macOS

### Hardware

- Minimum 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)
- At least 100 MB of free disk space for source, build, and artifacts

### Additional Tools

- A supported C++ compiler (see above)
- Build Tools:
  - CMake (recommended)
  - Bazel (optional for Google's build system users)
  - Make or equivalent build utility

### Network

- Internet access to clone or download GoogleTest source (via Git or HTTP)

## 3. Development Environment Preparation

Before beginning your installation and first test, ensure the following:

### Verify Compiler Version

Run the following commands to confirm compiler availability and version:

```bash
# GCC
g++ --version

# Clang
clang++ --version

# MSVC (Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt)
cl
```

Verify the output shows a version meeting the minimum requirements.

### Check C++11 Support

Try compiling a small test file with a C++11 flag:

```cpp
// test.cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  auto x = 42;
  std::cout << x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Compile with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test && ./test
``` 

Successful compilation and output confirms C++11 support.

### Environmental Variables

No special environment variables are strictly required. However, ensuring your path variables include your compiler and build tools will simplify the build process.

## 4. Best Practices for Compatibility

To avoid common pitfalls:

- Always match your build tools versions with your compiler version—for example, do not use significantly older CMake versions with the latest compiler releases.
- Prefer newer compiler versions within your supported range to leverage improved standards compliance and bug fixes.
- Confirm that exceptions and RTTI are enabled. Some build setups disable these for performance; GoogleTest requires both.

<Warning>
Disabling RTTI or exceptions will cause GoogleTest to malfunction, potentially resulting in compilation errors or runtime failures.
</Warning>

## 5. Confirmation Checklist

Before proceeding to installation and running your first test, ensure:

- [ ] Compiler is installed and version confirmed (see §1 and §3).
- [ ] C++11 support verified via test compile (see §3).
- [ ] Build tools like CMake or Bazel are installed.
- [ ] Sufficient system resources (disk space and memory).
- [ ] Exception handling and RTTI are enabled in the build environment.

<Tip>
Running your test compile and environment verification first saves time and avoids frustration during installation.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting & Common Pain Points">
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Found or Wrong Version">
If the compiler command (`g++`, `clang++`, or `cl`) is not found or reports a version below the supported minimum:

- Ensure your compiler is installed properly.
- Check your PATH environment variable to include the compiler's binary location.
- On Windows, use the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt to get the correct environment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++11">
If your compiler complains about unknown flags or unsupported language features:

- Verify you are passing the `-std=c++11` (or higher) flag for GCC/Clang.
- Upgrade your compiler to a supported version.
- For MSVC, verify project settings include C++11 support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="RTTI or Exceptions Disabled">
If you encounter linker errors or runtime issues suggesting RTTI or exceptions are disabled:

- Check compiler flags to ensure exceptions (`-fexceptions` for GCC/Clang) are enabled.
- Ensure RTTI is enabled; do not use `-fno-rtti` unless absolutely needed.
- Modify project settings in IDEs to support RTTI and exceptions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build Tools Missing or Incompatible">
- Verify installation and version of CMake or Bazel.
- Use the latest stable releases recommended in your workflow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Disk Space or Memory">
- Free up space or increase memory as needed.
- Close other high-memory applications to allocate more resources for builds.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Next Steps

Once your system meets the prerequisites:

- Proceed to [Installing GoogleTest (CMake & Bazel)](/getting-started/prep-requirements-installation/install-cmake-bazel) to set up the library.
- After installation, use [Validating Your Installation: Run Your First Test](/getting-started/prep-requirements-installation/validation-first-test) to run a simple test verifying everything works.
- Explore the [Getting Started with Mocks Guide](/guides/mocking-and-advanced-scenarios/mocking-basics) if you plan to use GoogleMock.
