# Validating Your Installation: Run Your First Test

This guide ensures your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation is correctly set up by walking you through creating, building, and running a minimal test. You'll get a working code snippet, learn how to verify your setup, and find straightforward debugging steps to resolve common issues. This immediate hands-on validation empowers you to start writing tests with confidence.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

Before running your first test, verify the following:

- **Compiler Compatibility:** Ensure your compiler supports C++11 or later.
- **Installation Completion:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries and headers are installed and accessible.
- **Build System Ready:** You have a build system configured (e.g., CMake or Bazel) that can compile and link your tests against GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

If you have not completed installation, see [Installing GoogleTest (CMake & Bazel)](/getting-started/prep-requirements-installation/install-cmake-bazel).


## 2. Write a Minimal Test Case

Create a C++ source file named `first_test.cc` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple numeric test case.
TEST(SampleTest, ReturnsTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

This minimal test verifies that your environment can compile and run a GoogleTest test successfully.


## 3. Build Your Test

### Using CMake
If you use CMake, set up a `CMakeLists.txt` with this minimal content:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(FirstTest)

# Find GoogleTest package
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(first_test first_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(first_test GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main pthread)
```

Build and run your test:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./first_test
```

### Using Bazel
If Bazel is your build system, write a `BUILD` file:

```starlark
cc_test(
    name = "first_test",
    srcs = ["first_test.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main"],
)
```

Run your test:

```bash
bazel test //:first_test
```


## 4. Run Your First Test

Executing the built test binary should produce output similar to this:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.ReturnsTrue
[       OK ] SampleTest.ReturnsTrue (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms that GoogleTest is installed correctly and functioning.


## 5. Debugging Common Setup Issues

If your test fails to compile or run, here are quick checks:

- **Header Not Found:** Ensure your compiler include paths include GoogleTest headers.
- **Linker Errors:** Verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are linked.
- **Missing Main Function:** GoogleTest provides `gtest_main`. Make sure you link against it or define your own `main`.
- **Version Mismatch:** Confirm that both GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions you use are compatible.

<Tip>
To diagnose runtime failures or failed assertions, run tests with verbose output:
```bash
./first_test --gtest_verbose=info
```
This will print detailed logs to aid debugging.
</Tip>


## 6. Next Steps

With your installation validated, you can:

- Begin writing tests targeting your codebase with [Writing Your First Test Case](/getting-started/configuring-using-tests/write-first-test-case).
- Explore mock objects to simulate dependencies via the [Getting Started with Mocks](/guides/mocking-and-advanced-scenarios/mocking-basics) guide.
- Learn to integrate and run tests using [Running Tests & Interpreting Output](/getting-started/configuring-using-tests/running-tests-validate-output).

## Appendix: Example Full Command Workflow

```bash
# Create test source file
cat > first_test.cc << EOL
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, ReturnsTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
EOL

# Build with CMake
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run test
./first_test
```

<Tip>
Replace CMake build steps with your preferred build toolchain commands.

## Troubleshooting Summary

| Issue                          | Symptom                                        | Resolution                                                                |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Header Files Not Found         | Compiler errors about missing `gtest/gtest.h` | Ensure include paths are correct, check installation                      |
| Linker Errors                 | Undefined references to gTest symbols           | Link against GTest and pthread libraries                                  |
| Missing `main()`              | Link error or runtime failure                    | Link against `gtest_main` or define a `main` yourself                    |
| Test Fails or Errors at Runtime | Test output errors or crashes                 | Use verbose flag, ensure all dependencies installed and compatible       |
