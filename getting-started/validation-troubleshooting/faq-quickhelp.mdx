# FAQ & Quick Help

This page provides you with quick access to frequently asked questions that commonly help resolve setup and configuration concerns with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. When first-time attempts to build, configure, or run tests do not succeed, this resource directs you to relevant solutions and further reading.

---

### 1. Common Setup and Installation Issues

#### Q1: How do I build GoogleTest using CMake?
1. Ensure you have CMake installed (minimum version 3.14 recommended).
2. Clone GoogleTest repository at a stable tag (for example, v1.17.0):

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
 cd googletest
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
```

3. To build only GoogleTest without GoogleMock, run:

```bash
 cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

4. Build using make (on Unix-like systems):

```bash
 make
```

5. Optionally, install the library:

```bash
 sudo make install
```

6. On Windows, open the created Visual Studio solution `gtest.sln` and build.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues with Visual Studio runtime library mismatches, enable the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtimes:

```bash
 cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```
</Tip>

---

#### Q2: What C++ standard is required for GoogleTest?
- GoogleTest requires a build environment supporting **C++17** or later.
- You can set the standard explicitly in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- For C projects using GoogleTest for validation, specify flags with `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.

---

### 2. Using GoogleTest in Your Project

#### Q3: How to add GoogleTest as a dependency in a CMake project?
- Use CMake's `FetchContent` module:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/XXX.zip
)
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)  # Windows only
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)
```

- Replace `XXX` with the specific Git commit hash or version tag.
- Link against GoogleTest targets (`GTest::gtest`, `GTest::gtest_main`) when adding test executables.

---

#### Q4: How do I run my first test binary?
1. Write a simple test source file, for example `hello_test.cc`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_STRNE("hello", "world");
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
}
```

2. Add the executable and link with GoogleTest in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
enable_testing()

add_executable(hello_test hello_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(hello_test GTest::gtest_main)
include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(hello_test)
```

3. Build your project with CMake and run the tests:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cd build
ctest
```

4. You should see output indicating tests passed successfully.

### 3. GoogleMock Quick Help

#### Q5: What is GoogleMock and how does it relate to GoogleTest?
- GoogleMock (gMock) is a framework for writing and using C++ mock classes.
- It is bundled with GoogleTest and designed especially for C++ mocking needs.
- You can create mock classes easily, set expectations, and check interactions.
- This helps you write more robust and faster tests, especially when dependencies must be simulated.

Refer to [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) for a friendly introduction.

---

#### Q6: How do I define mock classes using GoogleMock?
- Include `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files.
- Derive a mock class from the interface/class you want to mock.
- Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro for each virtual method you want to mock. Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};
```

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to specify method call expectations.

<Tip>
Always mock methods in the `public:` section regardless of their base class access.
</Tip>

---

### 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Q7: Why am I seeing "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings?
- This indicates a mock method was called without an explicit `EXPECT_CALL`.
- To suppress these warnings:
  - Use `NiceMock<YourMockClass>` instead of `YourMockClass`.
  - Or add catch-all expectations with `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());`.

<Warning>
Do not add excessive `EXPECT_CALL`s just to silence warnings, as this makes tests harder to maintain.
</Warning>

---

#### Q8: What if my mock method is called more times than expected?
- Check your `Times()` specification on the `EXPECT_CALL`. Adjust it to `AtLeast()`, `AnyNumber()`, or increase the count if needed.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` if you want expectations to retire after saturation to avoid overlapping matches.

---

#### Q9: How to resolve Visual Studio linking errors related to runtimes?
- Use the CMake option:

```bash
-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

- This makes GoogleTest link using the shared runtime matching your project.
- Ensures runtime library compatibility avoiding errors like `LNK2038`.
