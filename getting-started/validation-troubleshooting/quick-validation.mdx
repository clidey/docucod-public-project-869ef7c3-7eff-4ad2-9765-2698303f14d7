# Quick Validation Checklist

This guide provides a straightforward set of steps and commands to verify that **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock** are correctly installed and functional in your development environment. Follow these instructions to confirm you can build, link, and run simple tests without friction.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

Before running validations, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- You have GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed, either by building from source or via package managers.
- Your compiler supports **C++17** or a newer standard.
- Your build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel) is configured to include GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and link the libraries.
- Basic knowledge of compiling and running C++ tests is assumed.

<Tip>
If you haven't installed or configured GoogleTest and GoogleMock yet, start with the [Install with CMake](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/installation-quickstart/install-cmake) or [Install with Bazel](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/installation-quickstart/install-bazel).
</Tip>

## 2. Write a Simple Test File

Create a minimal C++ source file to test GoogleTest and GoogleMock functionality.

```cpp
// Filename: simple_test.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// Simple test to verify GoogleTest is working
TEST(Sanity, GoogleTestWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

// Example mock class
class MockInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), ());
};

// Test using GoogleMock
TEST(MockSanity, MockObjectResponds) {
  MockInterface mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
      .WillOnce(testing::Return(42));

  int result = mock.GetValue();
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 42);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

<Tip>
Save this file in a workspace where you have configured your build environment to compile and link against GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
</Tip>

## 3. Compile the Test

Compile the test using your preferred method. Below are examples for **g++** and **CMake**.

### a) Using g++ Command Line

```bash
# Adjust include and library paths according to your installation.
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /usr/local/include -pthread simple_test.cpp \
    -L/usr/local/lib -lgtest -lgtest_main -lgmock -lgmock_main -o simple_test
```

<Tip>
- Use `-isystem` to include GoogleTest headers to suppress warnings from third-party code.
- The linked libraries must match what you have installed (`-lgtest`, `-lgmock`).
- On Windows or other environments, adapt commands accordingly.
</Tip>

### b) Using CMake

Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(SimpleTest)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

# Find GoogleTest package
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(simple_test simple_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(simple_test GTest::gtest GTest::gmock GTest::gtest_main GTest::gmock_main pthread)
```

Build the test:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

<Tip>
Ensure your CMake environment can locate GoogleTest. You may need to set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or install GoogleTest to a location CMake can find.
</Tip>

## 4. Run the Test Executable

Execute the compiled test binary:

```bash
./simple_test
```

Expected output snippet:

```
Running main() from ...
[==========] Running 2 tests from 2 test cases.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from Sanity
[ RUN      ] Sanity.GoogleTestWorks
[       OK ] Sanity.GoogleTestWorks (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from Sanity

[----------] 1 test from MockSanity
[ RUN      ] MockSanity.MockObjectResponds
[       OK ] MockSanity.MockObjectResponds (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from MockSanity

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 2 test cases ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

This output confirms that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are functioning as expected.

<Tip>
If you see any failures, check the compiler and linker flags, and verify your installation paths.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Undefined Reference to `gtest` or `gmock` Symbols

- **Cause:** GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries are not linked.
- **Fix:** Ensure linking with `-lgtest -lgmock`, or link with `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gmock` if using CMake.

### Issue: Include Files Not Found

- **Cause:** Missing or incorrect include paths.
- **Fix:** Verify `-I` or `-isystem` flags in compiler command include GoogleTest headers.

### Issue: Test Executes But Reports No Tests Run

- **Cause:** Test main function missing or not calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- **Fix:** Add a main function shown in the sample test file above.

### Issue: Warning About Uninteresting Calls in Mock

- **Cause:** You called a mock method without a matching `EXPECT_CALL`.
- **Fix:** Add an `EXPECT_CALL` or use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-issues) page for more problems and solutions.
</Tip>

## 6. Verification Summary

When your test:

- Compiles without errors or warnings
- Links successfully against GoogleTest and GoogleMock
- Runs and reports that all tests passed

You have validated that your installation and integration are functional.

## 7. Next Steps

- Explore writing more extensive tests and mocks by reviewing [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html).
- Learn advanced mocking techniques in the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html).
- Incorporate GoogleTest into your project's regular build and CI pipelines.

<Check>
Ensure your build environment is consistent with these steps to smoothly develop and maintain tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
