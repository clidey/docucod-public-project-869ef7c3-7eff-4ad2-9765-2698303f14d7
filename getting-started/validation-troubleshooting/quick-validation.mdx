# Quick Validation

Ensure your GoogleTest installation is functioning correctly by following this pragmatic checklist. This page guides you to run a basic test file, verify the test output, and confirm your development environment is prepared for building and running tests.

---

## 1. Verify Installation by Running a Basic Test

Before progressing to writing your own tests, confirm that GoogleTest is properly installed and operational on your system.

### Step 1: Locate or Create a Simple Test File

You can use a simple test source file similar to the GoogleTest internal sample `googletest/test/googletest-output-test_.cc`, which contains straightforward test cases illustrating success and failure cases with output that GoogleTest supports. Alternatively, create the following minimal test file (let's call it `basic_test.cc`):

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple passing test.
TEST(BasicTestSuite, TestPass) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

// A simple failing test.
TEST(BasicTestSuite, TestFail) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 2) << "This test is meant to fail.";
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Step 2: Compile the Test

Use your build system or compile manually with the proper flags and links including GoogleTest libraries. For example, with `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread basic_test.cc /path/to/libgtest.a -o basic_test
```

Replace `/path/to/googletest/include` and `/path/to/libgtest.a` with your actual GoogleTest include and library paths.

### Step 3: Run the Test Binary

Execute the compiled binary:

```bash
./basic_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from BasicTestSuite
[ RUN      ] BasicTestSuite.TestPass
[       OK ] BasicTestSuite.TestPass (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] BasicTestSuite.TestFail
/path/to/basic_test.cc:9: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  1
  2
This test is meant to fail.
[  FAILED  ] BasicTestSuite.TestFail (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from BasicTestSuite (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] BasicTestSuite.TestFail

 1 FAILED TEST
```

### Step 4: Confirm Expected Output

A successful validation includes:
- The passing test reports `[       OK ]`.
- The failing test reports `[  FAILED  ]` with error details.
- The summary `1 FAILED TEST` confirms the test suite behaviour.

<Tip>
If your output matches this structure, your basic GoogleTest setup is verified and ready for development.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If you encounter "undefined reference" or "missing headers" during compilation, or if no tests run, ensure you have:
- Correctly installed the GoogleTest libraries and headers.
- Properly linked against `libgtest` and `libpthread` (on POSIX).
- Called `InitGoogleTest` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your main function.
</Warning>


## 2. Understand Your Test Environment State

Once your tests run and output appears, ensure your environment supports the following:

- **C++17 or later:** GoogleTest requires C++17 compatible compiler support.
- **Threading:** GoogleTest is thread-safe requiring POSIX threads or Windows threading support.
- **Environment Variables:** Sharding and filtering via environment variables like `GTEST_FILTER`, `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`, etc., may affect test execution.

<Tip>
Verify your compiler and environment by consulting the [System Requirements](../prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) page.
</Tip>


## 3. Key Verification Checks for a Healthy Test

### Test Registration and Discovery
- Confirm tests listed in the output match those defined.
- Disabled tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` should appear but not run unless overridden with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

### Assertion Behaviour
- Passing assertions report success silently.
- Failing assertions generate failure messages with file, line, and expected vs actual values.
- Custom failure messages streamed into assertions (e.g., `<< 'message'`) are displayed.

### Fixture and Parameterized Tests
- If using fixtures (`TEST_F`) or parameterized tests (`TEST_P`), validate that SetUp, TearDown, and parameter instances behave as documented.
- Missing `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for parameterized tests will cause synthetic failures visible in output.


## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Quick Validation Issues">
  <Accordion title="The test binary does nothing or prints help message">
    This typically means flags are not correctly parsed or `InitGoogleTest` was not called.

    **Solution:** Ensure your main calls `InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot find GoogleTest headers or libraries during compilation">
    Check your include and library paths. Ensure GoogleTest is installed or built and accessible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tests are not discovered or run">
    Verify naming conventions (e.g., no underscores in test or suite names), no disabled prefixes, and that filters or shards are not excluding all tests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unexpected test pass or failure">
    Check your assertions usage, confirm you aren’t ignoring returned values from RUN_ALL_TESTS, and verify no fatal failures prevent further test execution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 5. Next Steps

- Start writing your own tests, refer to [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-setup/writing-running-first-test).

### Summary

Use this checklist immediately after installation to confirm your environment and build pipeline work correctly with GoogleTest. Running a basic test file with passing and failing cases helps verify that GoogleTest is installed, discovered, and functioning as expected.
