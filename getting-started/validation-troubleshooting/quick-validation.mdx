# Quick Validation Steps

This guide helps you confirm that GoogleTest has been correctly installed and integrated into your development environment. By running simple example tests and interpreting their results, you can quickly detect any misconfiguration or integration issues before advancing into deeper development activities.

---

## 1. Verify GoogleTest Installation

Before running tests, ensure your environment recognizes GoogleTest and it is accessible to your build system.

### Step 1. Check GoogleTest Headers and Libraries

- Confirm that `gtest/gtest.h` and `gmock/gmock.h` headers are available in your include paths.
- Verify the GoogleTest libraries (static or shared) are correctly built or installed and your project is linked against them.

<Tip>
If you installed GoogleTest via package managers or built from source, ensure your `CMakeLists.txt` or build script uses `${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS}` and `${GTEST_LIBRARIES}`, or the equivalent, properly.
</Tip>

### Step 2. Use a Minimal Test Example

Create a simple test file, for instance, `sample_test.cc`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, AssertionTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build this test using your usual build process. For example, with CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
build/sample_test
```

> The test should pass without errors and print output indicating that 1 test ran successfully.

<Check>
If you see "[  PASSED  ] 1 test." the basic GoogleTest environment is functioning.
</Check>

## 2. Run Sample or Existing Tests

If you have existing example tests or samples from GoogleTest, proceed to build and run them.

### Step 1. Build the Sample Tests

Follow the project-specific instructions to build sample tests or your own.

> Usually, building will invoke compilation of test files and linking against GoogleTest libraries.

### Step 2. Execute the Test Binary

Run the produced test executable without arguments to launch all tests.

Expected output includes:

- A list of test suites and tests run
- Summary of how many tests passed or failed

Example successful output excerpt:

```text
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.MyTest1
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.MyTest1 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.MyTest2
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.MyTest2 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MyTestSuite.MyTest3
[       OK ] MyTestSuite.MyTest3 (0 ms)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

### Step 3. Review Test Results

- If all tests pass, your GoogleTest installation and integration are validated.
- If any test fails, inspect the failure messages for clues.

<Warning>
Failures may indicate either genuine code issues or GoogleTest misconfiguration. Confirm your build scripts, include paths, and library linking are correct.
</Warning>

## 3. Interpreting Common Output

GoogleTest provides detailed test results to help you diagnose issues quickly.

- **Passed Test:** Shown with `[  PASSED  ]` flag and no error messages.
- **Failed Test:** Includes the test location and assertion failure details.
- **Skipped or Disabled Tests:** Indicated with `[  SKIPPED ]` or `DISABLED_` prefix on test names.

<Tip>
Use the test output to identify specific tests or suites causing problems and focus your debugging there.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Troubleshooting Checks

If test execution does not work as expected, check the following:

- Are the include paths and linker flags set properly?
- Is your compiler compatible with GoogleTest requirements (supports C++17)?
- Have you run `InitGoogleTest` before test execution?
- Are there missing dependencies or runtime errors?
- For Windows users: Are you linking with the correct runtime libraries (debug vs release)?

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../common-issues) guide for detailed assistance.

## 5. Next Steps

Once you've successfully validated GoogleTest installation:

- Proceed to writing your first test using the guide: [Your First Test: Quick Success](../first-test)
- Explore configuration for your project: [Basic Configuration & Project Setup](../configuration-basics)
- Learn about writing mocks and expectations: [Introducing Mocking with GoogleMock](../../guides/getting-started/integrate-mocking)

Regular validation throughout development helps catch environment problems early and saves debugging efforts.
