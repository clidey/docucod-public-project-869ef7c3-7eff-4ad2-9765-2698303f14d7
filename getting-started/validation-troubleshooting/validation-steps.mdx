# Verifying Your Installation

This guide walks you through validating your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup to ensure everything is correctly installed and working as expected. You'll run example tests that confirm both libraries function properly, observing the expected output and learning how to interpret results.

---

## 1. Prerequisites and Preparation

Before verifying your installation, make sure:

- You have followed the installation instructions for GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including building or integrating the libraries into your project.
- Your build environment includes the necessary compiler and linker flags to incorporate GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and libraries.
- Your test executable is correctly linked against both GoogleTest (`gtest`) and GoogleMock (`gmock`) libraries.


## 2. Running the Example Tests

GoogleTest and GoogleMock come with example test files that verify core functionality. Running these tests is the most straightforward method to check your installation.

### Step 1: Build the Tests

If you cloned the repository and built GoogleTest and GoogleMock, example tests are usually built alongside. Otherwise, compile the example test source files manually, making sure to include the correct include directories and link against the correct GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.

For instance, compile on a Unix-like system with:

```bash
# Replace paths with your local installation paths
c++ -std=c++11 -isystem path/to/googletest/include \
    -Ipath/to/googlemock/include \
    path/to/gtest/libgtest.a path/to/gmock/libgmock.a \
    example_test.cc -pthread -o example_test
```

### Step 2: Execute the Test Binary

Run the tests via the command line:

```bash
./example_test
```

### Expected Output

Upon running, you should see output similar to:

```plain
[==========] Running N tests from M test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] X tests from FooTest
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Bar
[       OK ] FooTest.Bar
...
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] N tests from M test suites ran. (some ms total)
[  PASSED  ] N tests.
```

Where `N` and `M` are the number of tests and test suites.

This indicates that both GoogleTest and GoogleMock are functioning correctly.

## 3. Running a Simple Test with GoogleMock

To specifically validate GoogleMock, you can write and run a minimal test using a mock class:

### Example Mock Class

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// An example interface to mock
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int GetValue(int x) = 0;
};

// Mock class
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (int x), (override));
};
```

### Example Test

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::Return;

TEST(MockExampleTest, BasicExpectCall) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue(5))
      .WillOnce(Return(10));

  int result = mock.GetValue(5);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 10);
}
```

### Running this test

1. Compile the test with GoogleTest and GoogleMock linked.
2. Run the test executable.
3. You should see the test pass successfully.

## 4. Understanding Test Results

- **Pass**: Your output will show all tests running and passing, confirming a healthy installation.
- **Fail/Warning**: Failure indicates a problem with your build, linking, or runtime environment. The output will contain detailed messages about what failed.
- **No Test Found or Linker Errors**: Indicates problems linking or missing files. Make sure your compile and link commands include all needed inputs.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all dependencies such as pthreads are linked.
- Confirm the correct header include paths and library link paths.
- Use verbose test output by running your tests with `--gtest_verbose=info` to get detailed logs of mock interactions.
- If you see linkage errors, verify library paths and names.
- On Windows, ensure the runtime libraries for GoogleTest and GoogleMock match those used in your build.

## 6. Next Steps

- After successful test runs, explore writing your own tests using [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html).
- Learn mocking techniques and expectations from the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html).
- Use the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) to leverage powerful validation features.
- Integrate tests into your build and continuous integration process for full test automation.
