# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation works perfectly by running through these crucial checks immediately after setup. This checklist helps catch common misconfigurations and confirm that your development environment is correctly configured.

---

## 1. Verify Installation and Version

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Confirm that the GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers are accessible. For example, confirm you can locate `gtest/gtest.h` and `gmock/gmock.h` in your include path.
3. Check the version of GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed by inspecting your package manager or the source repository version.


## 2. Build a Simple Test Program

Create a minimal test source file `simple_test.cc` to verify that everything compiles and runs:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Build Command Example

On Linux/macOS with g++:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 simple_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o simple_test
```

Or with Bazel or CMake, refer to your build integration guide.


## 3. Run the Simple Test

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./simple_test
```

Expected output snippet:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest
[ RUN      ] SimpleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SimpleTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SimpleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

If the test runs and passes, your installation and linkage are confirmed correct.


## 4. Validate GoogleMock Functionality

Create a simple mock example to ensure GoogleMock is working.

### Mock Class Definition

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n), ());
};
```

### Test with Expectation Example

```cpp
TEST(MockTest, BarReturnsValue) {
  MockFoo foo;
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(5))
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(10));

  EXPECT_EQ(foo.Bar(5), 10);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Build and Run

Compile and run similarly to the simple test. Confirm this test passes to verify gMock works.


## 5. Check Core GoogleTest Flags

Run your test executables with the `--help` flag and confirm GoogleTest options display correctly:

```bash
./simple_test --help
```

Look for a list of flags like `--gtest_filter`, `--gtest_repeat`, `--gtest_shuffle`, etc.


## 6. Run Tests with Common Flags

Try running your tests with these flags to confirm functionality:

- Run only a subset of tests:

  ```bash
  ./simple_test --gtest_filter=SimpleTest.*
  ```

- Repeat tests:

  ```bash
  ./simple_test --gtest_repeat=3
  ```

- Request colored output:

  ```bash
  ./simple_test --gtest_color=yes
  ```

Confirm tests run as expected with these options, outputting colors or filtering tests.


## 7. Validate Assertion Macros

Write and run tests covering several assertion types including:
- `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_EQ`
- `EXPECT_TRUE` and `ASSERT_TRUE`
- `EXPECT_THROW` and `ASSERT_THROW` (if exceptions enabled)
- `EXPECT_DEATH` (for death tests, if applicable)

Verify that tests fail when expected and pass otherwise.


## 8. Validate Test Fixture Behavior

Create a test fixture class and tests using `TEST_F` to ensure fixture lifecycle works. Confirm `SetUp`, `TearDown`, `SetUpTestSuite`, and `TearDownTestSuite` are called correctly.


## 9. Check GoogleTest and GoogleMock Integration

Ensure you can link both frameworks together and write mock-based tests that run assertions using GoogleTest macros.


## 10. Inspect Test Output Files (Optional)

If you enabled XML or JSON output with `--gtest_output=xml:output.xml` or `json:output.json`, verify these files are created with meaningful test reports.


---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If tests fail to compile, verify your compiler version and C++ standard.
- If you get linker errors, ensure you link `-lgtest`, `-lgtest_main` and `-lgmock` correctly.
- If tests hang on launch, check thread creation or death test styles.
- Confirm environment variables like `GTEST_COLOR` and flags like `--gtest_filter` are passed properly.
