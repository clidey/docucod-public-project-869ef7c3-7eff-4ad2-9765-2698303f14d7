# Troubleshooting Common Issues

When integrating GoogleMock into your testing environment, encountering setup and runtime issues is common. This guide addresses the most frequent problems such as build errors, missing dependencies, linking issues, and environment misconfigurations. Alongside, it provides practical troubleshooting advice, enabling you to quickly diagnose and resolve problems to ensure smooth operation.

## 1. Common Setup and Build Problems

### 1.1 Build Errors

- **Undefined References to Mock Methods**
  - Cause: Missing or incorrect linking of GoogleMock libraries or forgetting to include source files.
  - Solution: Ensure that `gmock` and related libraries are linked correctly. For CMake projects, verify `target_link_libraries` includes `gmock` and `gmock_main` (if using the main).
  - Tip: Verify that your mock classes are correctly defined with `MOCK_METHOD` macros and that the macros are in the public section of the mock class.

- **Compiler Warnings Related to Mock Methods With `const` Parameters**
  - Cause: Some compiler versions (notably MSVC 2005 SP1) emit warnings when mock methods are declared with `const` parameters even though `const` qualifiers on parameters are ignored in C++ declarations.
  - Solution: Remove `const` in parameter declarations in both interface and mock declarations.

- **Slow Compilation When Mocking Large Classes**
  - Cause: The mock class constructor and destructor generation can consume significant compiler resources when many mock methods exist.
  - Solution: Move the mock class's constructor and destructor definitions out of the header file into the `.cc` file. This prevents multiple instantiations across compilation units and speeds up the build.

### 1.2 Missing Dependencies

- **Build Tool Missing**
  - Ensure CMake or Bazel (depending on build method) is installed correctly.
- **C++ Standard Compliance**
  - GoogleMock requires C++17 or above; compiling with older standards leads to errors.

### 1.3 Linking Issues

- Verify that your build system includes proper linking paths for GoogleMock and GoogleTest libraries.
- When building from source, ensure that both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries are available and correctly specified.

## 2. Runtime and Mock-Related Issues

### 2.1 Unexpected or Uninteresting Calls

- **Uninteresting Call Warning**
  - Occurs when a mock method without an expectation (`EXPECT_CALL`) is called.
  - By default, GoogleMock warns but continues running.
  - Solution: If these calls are expected and safe to ignore, use `NiceMock<T>` instead of `Mock<T>`, which suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
  - If calls should be verified, add proper `EXPECT_CALL` statements or use `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for methods you want to allow but not strictly verify.

- **Unexpected Call Failure**
  - Happens when a mock method is called with arguments that don't match any specified expectation.
  - Solution: Review your `EXPECT_CALL` arguments and ensure they match the parameters passed during execution.

### 2.2 Expectations Not Satisfied

- If gMock reports that expectations are not satisfied, run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info`.
  - This prints detailed traces of calls and their matching expectations.
  - Use this output to locate mismatches or missing calls.

### 2.3 Multiple Failure Reports of the Same Expectation

- GoogleMock may print multiple failures for the same unmet expectation across different points during execution.
- This is informational and reflects the state changes over time, not redundant messages.

### 2.4 Heapcheck Issues When Using Mock Objects

- Cause: Base class being mocked lacks a virtual destructor, leading to incomplete destruction of derived mock objects.
- Solution: Always declare destructors as `virtual` in interfaces.

### 2.5 Mocking Non-Virtual or Static Methods

- GoogleMock cannot directly mock static or non-virtual methods.
- Suggested workaround:
  - Refactor code to use interfaces with virtual methods.
  - Use template-based dependency injection for non-virtual methods.
  - For static functions, use interfaces or wrapper classes to enable mocking.

### 2.6 Mock Method Overloading Issues

- When mocking overloaded methods, ensure all overloads are mocked if used to avoid hidden base class methods.
- Use `using Base::MethodName;` inside your mock to bring unmocked overloads into scope.

## 3. Controls for Mock Behavior

### 3.1 Adjusting Strictness

- **NaggyMock (default)**: Prints warnings for uninteresting calls.
- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as errors (failures).

Use these wrapper templates to tune test sensitivity:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockClass> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockClass> strict_mock;
```

### 3.2 Verbosity Levels

Control message verbosity during test runs with the `--gmock_verbose=` flag:

- `info`: Shows all info, warnings, errors; includes detailed call traces.
- `warning`: Shows warnings and errors (default).
- `error`: Shows errors only.

## 4. Debugging Tips and Best Practices

- Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain insight into mock calls and matching expectations.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`), ordering (`After`), and cardinalities (`Times`) to specify call order and frequency clearly.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations; use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only for calls you want to verify.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations to mark them inactive after fulfillment, useful in managing overlapping expectations.

## 6. Additional Troubleshooting Resources

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Build and Linking Errors">
Ensure dependencies are met, libraries linked, and compiler versions are compatible. Inspect build output for missing symbols or incorrect flags.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Function Misbehavior">
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace calls, verify expectations, and debug unexpected or unmet calls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler-Specific Issues">
For MSVC warnings related to const parameters, remove top-level const qualifiers in method signatures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Memory Leaks with Mocks">
Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to explicitly allow leaked mocks or verify proper destruction.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always prefer `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising your mock objects, and avoid setting expectations after usage to prevent undefined behavior.

By systematically addressing the issues described here, users will have a much smoother experience in setting up and running GoogleMock tests. This guide complements basic installation and getting started resources by focusing on resolution pathways for common pitfalls.

## Sample Diagnostic Command

Run your tests with verbose logging and capture the output:

```sh
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

Analyze the output for mismatched calls or unmet expectations and refine your test setup accordingly.
