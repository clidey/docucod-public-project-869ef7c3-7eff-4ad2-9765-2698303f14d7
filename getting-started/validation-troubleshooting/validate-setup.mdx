# Validating Your Setup

Confirm your installation by running the pre-supplied sample tests and interpreting their results. This page guides you through executing GoogleTest's included example tests to verify that your development environment is correctly configured and ready for productive testing.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before running the sample tests, ensure the following:

- GoogleTest has been successfully built and installed on your system (see [Installing with CMake](../prerequisites-install/install-cmake.md)).
- Your environment variables and paths are correctly set to locate GoogleTest headers and libraries.
- You have a working C++ compiler compatible with GoogleTest's requirements.
- Your build system supports running unit tests (e.g., integration with CMake, Bazel, or manual compilation).

<Tip>
If you haven’t installed GoogleTest yet, start with the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](../prerequisites-install/system-requirements.md) and follow the official build instructions carefully.
</Tip>

## 2. Running the Sample Tests

GoogleTest includes a set of predefined tests that serve as verification points for a working installation.

### Step 1: Locate the Sample Test Executable

If you built GoogleTest from source using CMake:

- After running `cmake` and building, your build directory will contain test binaries, typically named like `googletest-all-tests` or similar.

### Step 2: Execute the Tests

Run the test executable from the command line:

```bash
./googletest-all-tests
```

or, on Windows:

```powershell
googletest-all-tests.exe
```

GoogleTest will automatically discover all tests compiled into the binary and execute them.

### Step 3: Observe Test Output

The console output will show detailed progress messages, including:

- The number of test suites and individual tests being run.
- The status of each test (`[ RUN ]`, `[ OK ]`, `[ FAILED ]`).
- Summaries indicating how many tests passed, failed, or were skipped.

A successful run ends with a summary similar to:

```
[==========] Running X tests from Y test suites.
[  PASSED  ] X tests.
```

If any tests fail, details will follow immediately, showing the assertion failure messages and stack traces.

---

## 3. Interpreting the Results

### What Success Looks Like

- All tests should **pass** without failures.
- If tests are skipped, confirm whether this is expected due to your environment.
- The overall return code from the test executable should be `0` (usually indicated when running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your own test program).

### Understanding Failures

Failures indicate possible issues with your installation or environment configuration. Common causes include:

- Incorrect linking against GoogleTest libraries.
- Incompatible compiler or runtime environment.
- Missing dependencies.

Examine the failure messages carefully; they often pinpoint the source line and reason.

## 4. Sample Test Cases to Watch

GoogleTest provides many sample tests demonstrating different features.

Here are some significant test patterns you should expect to see:

- **Simple Tests:** validate basic assertions and test definitions.
- **Test Fixtures:** tests using `TEST_F()` to verify fixture behavior.
- **Parameterized Tests:** using `TEST_P()`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` to check value-parameterized tests.
- **Typed Tests:** tests using `TYPED_TEST()` and `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` for multiple type instantiations.
- **Death Tests:** verifying expected failures and program termination behavior.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- If no tests run or no output appears, verify you have linked your test executable with GoogleTest libraries and that tests are registered properly.
- Ensure that your test names and test suite names follow GoogleTest naming conventions (no underscores in names).
- Check for build warnings or errors related to GoogleTest usage.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` command line flag to list all tests recognized by GoogleTest without running them:

```bash
./googletest-all-tests --gtest_list_tests
```

- Run tests with verbose output by using the `--gtest_verbose` flag if available for detailed diagnostics.

- If you encounter platform-specific issues, consult [Supported Platforms & Audience](../../overview/product-introduction/supported-platforms-and-audience.md).

## 6. Next Steps

After confirming your setup works:

- Start writing your own tests using the [GoogleTest Primer](../../docs/primer.md) and [Your First Test](../project-setup/first-test.md).
- Explore advanced testing features in [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](../../docs/advanced.md).
- Integrate tests into your build system ([Project Integration](../project-setup/project-integration.md)).
- Review [Configuring Test Execution](../project-setup/configuration-options.md) to control test runs.
