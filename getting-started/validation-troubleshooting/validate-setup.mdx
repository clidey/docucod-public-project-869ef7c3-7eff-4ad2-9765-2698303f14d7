# Quick Validation Checklist

Welcome to the final verification step after you have installed and configured GoogleTest. This concise checklist helps you confirm that your GoogleTest environment is correctly set up by building and running a sample test with expected output. Completing this validation gives you the confidence to immediately start writing your own tests.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start this validation, ensure that:

- GoogleTest is installed and built successfully.
- You have a working build system configured to compile and link GoogleTest in your project.
- Your environment variables and include/library paths are correctly set to find GoogleTest headers and libraries.
- You have a supported C++ compiler with C++17 or higher.

If you have not completed the installation and setup, please refer to the [Installation with CMake](../../requirements-installation/installation-cmake) or [Project Configuration](../../configuration-bootstrap/project-setup) guides.

---

## 2. Build a Sample Test

Create a simple test file to verify the GoogleTest setup. Here is a minimal example that uses GoogleTest's macros:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test verifying basic functionality.
TEST(SampleTest, ValidateTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Instructions

1. **Save the above code** to a source file, for example `sample_test.cpp`.
2. **Compile the test program**, linking against the GoogleTest libraries. For example, with `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o sample_test
```

If you used CMake to build GoogleTest, make sure to link your executable against `gtest` or `gtest_main` target accordingly.

3. **Build errors?**

- Verify include paths with `-I` flags.
- Verify library link path with `-L` flags if necessary.
- Ensure `pthread` is linked on POSIX systems.

---

## 3. Run the Sample Test

Execute the compiled test binary:

```bash
./sample_test
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.ValidateTrue
[       OK ] SampleTest.ValidateTrue (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

### What this shows:

- GoogleTest test runner initializes successfully.
- The sample test runs and passes.
- Setup and teardown of the global environment work correctly.

---

## 4. Validate Output and Behavior

Check for the following:

- The test prints `[  PASSED  ] 1 test.` indicating success.
- There are no build-time or run-time errors.
- The test run is fast, confirming no hangs or blocking.

If you observe failures or errors, you can:

- Revisit your build configuration.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../validation-troubleshooting/common-issues) guide.
- Verify that you're linking against the right GoogleTest libraries.

---

## 5. Optional: Run the Included Environment Validation Tests

GoogleTest includes example tests that further validate environment setup such as global setup and teardown behaviors. You can build and run the environment validation test file located at `googletest/test/gtest_environment_test.cc`.

### Build

Integrate this source into your build system and compile with GoogleTest. For example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 googletest/test/gtest_environment_test.cc -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o env_test
```

### Run

```bash
./env_test
```

Expected output: a simple `PASS` message, confirming that GoogleTest core features around environment setup and failures behave as expected.

---

## 6. Summary

You have now successfully:

- Built a basic test that uses GoogleTest macros.
- Run the test and verified the output is as expected.
- Validated global environment features successfully (optional).

This completes your setup validation and confirms your environment is ready for writing your own test suites.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Errors: Missing Headers or Libraries">
- Ensure include directory paths include GoogleTest's `include/` folder.
- Verify that the linker finds the `libgtest` and `libgtest_main` libraries.
- Link with `-pthread` on Linux/macOS.
- Use CMake's targets `gtest` and `gtest_main` where possible.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Executable Runs But No Tests Execute">
- Confirm your test functions use the `TEST` macro properly.
- Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()` and its return value is returned.
- Check that the test suite and test names do not use invalid characters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Fails Unexpectedly or Fails to Run">
- Check console output for assertion failure messages.
- Run tests with `--gtest_filter=*` to confirm filtering.
- Use `GTEST_FLAG_SET(filter, "*")` to disable filtering temporarily.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

- Start writing your own test suites using the [Writing and Running Your First Test](../../configuration-bootstrap/first-test-case) guide.
- Learn about advanced test features like fixtures and parameterized tests in the [GoogleTest Primer](../../../primer) documentation.
- Explore troubleshooting and common issues in the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../validation-troubleshooting/common-issues) page.
