# Verifying Your Setup

Quickly confirm that your GoogleTest installation is working correctly by running minimal tests, interpreting their outputs, and troubleshooting common initial issues.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Page

This page guides you through the essential steps to verify that GoogleTest is properly installed and integrated. You will:

- Run a minimal test executable.
- Understand the test runner output format.
- Learn to identify and resolve common setup errors.

This verification step ensures your environment is ready for writing and executing your own unit tests.

---

## 2. Running Your First Minimal Test

GoogleTest includes a minimal built-in test example that validates basic test discovery, execution, and framework integration.

### Step 1: Build or obtain the test executable

- If you installed GoogleTest via CMake or Bazel, a sample test executable is typically included or easy to create by following the "Writing Your First Unit Test" instructions.
- Alternatively, compile the provided minimal test file (`gtest_environment_test.cc`) included in the source repository.


### Step 2: Execute the test binary

Run the test executable from your command line:

```shell
./gtest_environment_test
```

### Expected Output Example

```plaintext
Running main() from gtest_environment_test.cc
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from FooTest
[ RUN      ] FooTest.Bar
[       OK ] FooTest.Bar (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from FooTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[  FAILED  ]
```

or if succeeding without failures:

```plaintext
PASS
```

This output confirms:

- GoogleTest initializes and runs tests.
- The global environment setup and teardown are invoked.
- The minimal test case executes successfully.

<Check>
If you see `PASS`, your GoogleTest installation is verified successfully.
</Check>

## 3. Understanding Test Output and Indicators

### Key Elements

- **Test execution summary**: Shows how many tests ran, passed, or failed.
- **SetUp and TearDown calls**: Indicates global test environment lifecycle is functioning.
- **FAILURES or errors**: Highlight setup or test execution issues.

### Interpreting Common Outputs

- `PASS` or `[       OK ]`: Test succeeded.
- `[  FAILED  ]`: Test or setup failed. Details below indicate the exact error.
- Print statements like `Running main() from <file>`: Confirm program entry point and initialization.

## 4. Common Initial Issues and Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue                                     | Cause                                        | Solution                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test executable doesn't run or crashes    | Missing GoogleTest library linkage or runtime | Verify build configuration; link against `gtest` and `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` if applicable. |
| `FAIL()` during global setup or teardown  | Errors in global test environment              | Check test environment classes you added; review error messages printed after test run. |
| Tests not discovered or executed           | Test filter incorrect or test binary malfunction | Run without filters; confirm test naming follows `TEST` or `TEST_F` conventions. |
| Linking errors on `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`       | GoogleTest headers/libraries not found       | Confirm include and library paths; ensure C++17 standard and CMake/Bazel build is correct. |

<Note>
Refer to the "Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues" guide for detailed solutions to these and other errors.
</Note>

## 5. Minimal Test Example Code

To better understand what the minimal test executable runs, here is a simplified example of a minimal GoogleTest program sourced from `gtest_environment_test.cc`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test to check framework.
TEST(FooTest, Bar) {
  SUCCEED();  // Marks the test as successful.
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and run this test as your first check.

---

## 6. Running GoogleTest with Verbose and Filters for Additional Verification

You can run tests with flags to gain more detailed insights:

- `--gtest_verbose=info`: Prints detailed information on test execution and matcher activity.
- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`: Runs specific tests.

Example:

```shell
./gtest_environment_test --gtest_verbose=info
```

---

## 7. Summary and Next Steps

Once you confirm that your tests run and produce expected output:

- Proceed to write your own tests following the "Writing Your First Unit Test" guide.
- Expand to project integration by configuring your build system as described in "Project Configuration."
- For any setup anomalies, refer to "Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues".

## Getting Support

If you encounter unexpected behavior beyond initial setup, seek help:

- Community forums and GoogleTest GitHub repository issues.
- Official documentation FAQ and Support pages.


<Info>
GoogleTest and GoogleMock initialization functions typically handle setting up test environments and integrating mocking features seamlessly.

## Troubleshooting Quick Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Test Executable Does Not Run or Link Errors">
Verify that your build links against GoogleTest libraries (`gtest`, `gtest_main`) correctly. Check compiler settings to ensure C++17 support is enabled and that include paths are valid.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="RUN_ALL_TESTS Fails or Skips Tests">
Ensure your tests are defined with the correct `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros and that GoogleTest is initialized properly with `InitGoogleTest()` in `main()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Global SetUp or TearDown Failures">
If failures appear related to global test environment setup or teardown, check your custom global environment implementations or test fixtures for unexpected failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Discovered or Empty Test Runs">
Confirm no restrictive filters are applied via `--gtest_filter` and your test names follow conventions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Sample Command to Build and Test (CMake example)

```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target gtest_environment_test
./gtest_environment_test
```

---

## Additional Notes

- GoogleTest requires C++17 or newer.
- Use `gtest_main` to avoid writing your own `main()` when starting simple.
- Output messages detail test counts and statuses clearly.

---
