# Quick Validation Checklist

Confirm your GoogleTest installation and configuration with this concise, actionable checklist. Follow each step to verify that the framework is correctly set up and ready for writing and running tests before moving on to more complex scenarios.

---

## 1. Verify GoogleTest Initialization

- Ensure your test binary calls `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` prior to running tests.
- Confirm your `main()` function returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

Example `main()`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

<Tip>
Failing to initialize GoogleTest or ignoring the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` can cause tests to report success even on failures.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Confirm Test Discovery

- Run your test binary with the flag `--gtest_list_tests`.
- Verify it outputs a list of all available test suites and their tests.

Command:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

Expected output format:

```
TestSuite1.
  TestName1
  TestName2
TestSuite2.
  TestNameA
```

<Note>
If no tests are listed, check that tests are properly linked and not disabled with `DISABLED_` prefixes.
</Note>

---

## 3. Run All Tests and Verify Basic Output

- Run your test binary without arguments.
- Observe the console output; it should start with something like:
  
  ```
  [==========] Running X tests from Y test suites.
  [----------] Global test environment set-up.
  ...
  [  PASSED  ] N tests.
  [  FAILED  ] M tests, listed below:
  ...
  ```

- The summary indicates the number of tests run, passed, failed, and skipped.

<Warning>
Having many failed tests on a fresh install likely means misconfiguration or missing dependencies.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Check for Skipped and Disabled Tests

- Disabled tests are those prefixed with `DISABLED_` or in disabled test suites.
- Skipped tests occur if `GTEST_SKIP()` is invoked or due to setup conditions.
- The summary output lists skipped and disabled tests explicitly.

Tips:

- Use the flag `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` to include disabled tests in the run.
- To quickly identify disabled tests in your code, grep for `DISABLED_` prefixes.

---

## 5. Verify Assertion and Failure Behavior

GoogleTest outputs clear failure messages and stack traces when assertions fail.

- Confirm failures show the expected and actual values.
- Look for detailed traces when using macros like `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE`.
- If using predicate assertions or matchers, check the failure message includes useful diagnostics.

Example failure snippet:

```
googletest-output-test_.cc:45: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  2
  3
Stack trace:
 ...
```

<Tip>
Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add context to failures occurring in utility functions.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Confirm Parameterized and Typed Tests Setup

- Parameterized tests must use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to create concrete instances.
- Untagged parameterized tests without instantiation appear as errors.
- Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(TestSuiteName)` to suppress warnings if intentional.

Verify that your test output shows multiple instantiations with distinct parameters, e.g.,

```
MeenyMinyMoe/FooTest.DoesBlah/0
MeenyMinyMoe/FooTest.DoesBlah/1
MeenyMinyMoe/FooTest.DoesBlah/2
```

---

## 7. Check Global Test Environment Setup and Teardown

- If using global test environments (`testing::Environment` subclasses), confirm their `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` run as expected before and after tests.
- Look for `[----------] Global test environment set-up.` and `[----------] Global test environment tear-down` messages in output.

---

## 8. Review Runtime Flags Affecting Test Execution

Consider these common flags and settings:

| Flag | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `--gtest_filter=` | Run a subset of tests matching the pattern |
| `--gtest_repeat=` | Run tests multiple times to detect flaky failures |
| `--gtest_shuffle` | Randomize the order tests run to identify inter-test dependencies |
| `--gtest_fail_fast` | Stop test execution on first failure |
| `--gtest_color=` | Enable or disable colored output (`yes`, `no`, `auto`) |
| `--gtest_list_tests` | List all tests without running them |

<Tip>
Use `--help` or `--gtest_help` to view all available GoogleTest flags.
</Tip>

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Tests Found

- Confirm your source files with tests are included in the build.
- Check for `DISABLED_` prefixes.
- Verify tests are defined with correct macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`).

### Tests Fail Unexpectedly

- Check output for precise assertion failure messages.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to break into a debugger at failures.

### Tests Always Pass

- Ensure that test cases return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Confirm the call to `InitGoogleTest` occurred before running tests.
- Validate that assertions are actually executed and not skipped.

### Parameterized Tests Not Running

- Verify all parameterized test suites have corresponding instantiations with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

- Start writing and running your first basic test case: [Writing and Running Your First Test](getting-started/initial-configuration/first-test-case).
- Learn about using assertions effectively: [Assertions Reference](docs/reference/assertions.md).

## Summary

This checklist guides you through verifying GoogleTestâ€™s installation and setup, ensuring tests are discovered, executed, and reported correctly. It prepares you to confidently begin writing tests and diagnosing setup issues early.

---

# Example Commands

### List Tests
```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
./your_test_binary
```

### Run Tests with Filter
```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
```

### Include Disabled Tests
```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

---

# Tips

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names (`TEST(MySuite, TestName)` where names contain no `_`) to prevent naming collisions.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` for better assertion failure context when assertions occur in helper functions.
- Pass meaningful names to parameterized test instantiations to ease identification.
- Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST()` if your parameterized test suite is intentionally uninstantiated to suppress errors.

---

# Common Output Pattern

```none
[==========] Running 4 tests from 2 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] SuiteName.TestName
[       OK ] SuiteName.TestName (5 ms)
...
[  PASSED  ] 4 tests.
```
