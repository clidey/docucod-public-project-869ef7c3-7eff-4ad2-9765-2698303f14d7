# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Ensure your system is properly prepared to build, configure, and use GoogleTest, the C++ testing framework. This page outlines all required hardware, software, compiler versions, and platform-specific considerations so you can confidently verify your environment before installation.

---

## 1. Supported C++ Standards

GoogleTest requires compliance with modern C++ standards for full compatibility and best functionality:

- Minimum supported standard: **C++11**
- Full compatibility with **C++14** and newer standards

Make sure your build system and compiler are configured to use at least C++11. This allows GoogleTest to utilize language features needed for its internal APIs and test constructs.

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest works reliably on a wide array of C++ compilers, provided the following minimum versions or compatible alternatives are met:

| Compiler             | Minimum Version        | Notes                                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GCC                  | 4.8+                  | Enable C++11 features with `-std=c++11` |
| Clang                | 3.3+                  | Enable C++11 with `-std=c++11`           |
| MSVC (Visual Studio) | Visual Studio 2015+ (VS 14.0) | Supports most C++11 features             |

Be aware that some older compiler versions lack full support for all C++11 features GoogleTest depends on and may cause subtle build or runtime issues.

### Compiler Flags

Always explicitly specify the C++ standard in your compiler flags (for example, `-std=c++11` or `/std:c++14`) to avoid compatibility problems.

## 3. Platform Support & Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports all major operating systems where a compliant C++ compiler is available:

- Linux distributions
- macOS
- Windows (including recent Visual Studio environments)

Confirm your target platform has an available compatible C++ compiler and standard library implementation conforming to the requirements listed above.

## 4. Hardware Requirements

GoogleTest itself is lightweight and imposes minimal hardware demands:

- **Processor**: Any modern CPU capable of running your development environment
- **Memory**: At least 512 MB RAM recommended to run build tools and tests comfortably
- **Disk Space**: Approximately 50 MB for the source and binaries, more depending on project size

No specialized hardware is required.

## 5. Dependencies and Tooling

Before building or using GoogleTest, ensure these tools and libraries are installed:

- **Build system**: Commonly `CMake` (recommended), or standard Makefiles.
- **Standard C++ library**: Provided with your compiler.
- **C++ Compiler**: As per the version chart.

GoogleTest does not have external library dependencies beyond the standard C++ runtime.

## 6. Access and Permissions

- Administrator or user-level permissions to install compilers and build tools may be required.
- Network access only needed if pulling GoogleTest from remote repositories or package managers.

## 7. Environment and Network

- No special network configuration is necessary for basic local testing.
- If integrating GoogleTest into CI pipelines or remote builds, ensure that appropriate firewall rules or proxy settings allow repository access.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

- **Compiler not recognizing C++11 flags**: Verify compiler version and installation. Upgrade to a supported version if needed.
- **Linker errors related to C++ standard library**: Confirm correct standard library linkage matching your compiler and C++ version.
- **Build failures on Windows**: Ensure Visual Studio installation includes C++ development tools and SDKs.
- **Missing build system tools**: Install or update `CMake` or chosen build tools.

### Example Compiler Check Commands

Run these in your terminal to verify compiler versions:

```bash
# GCC
gcc --version

# Clang
clang --version

# MSVC: from Developer Command Prompt
cl
```

### Example CMake Minimum Version in CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```
