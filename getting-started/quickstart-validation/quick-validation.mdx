# Validating the Installation

This page guides you through verifying that **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock** are properly installed and configured in your development environment. The validation process includes compiling and running simple test scripts and analyzing expected outputs to confirm success. It also covers troubleshooting common errors related to compilation and missing dependencies.

---

## 1. Purpose and Importance of Validation

After installing GoogleTest and GoogleMock, ensuring that they are configured correctly is crucial before writing real tests. Validation helps you confirm:

- The testing framework is discoverable by your build system and compiler.
- Necessary header files (`gtest/gtest.h`, `gmock/gmock.h`) and libraries are correctly linked.
- Basic test cases compile, execute, and produce expected test reports.
- The GoogleMock mocking features operate without error.

Skipping this step can lead to confusing build or runtime errors later.

---

## 2. Writing a Minimal Validation Test

Create a simple test file named `quick_validation_test.cc` or similar, containing both GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage. Here is a minimal example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

// A simple interface to mock.
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}
  virtual int GetValue(int x) = 0;
};

// Mock class derived from Foo.
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (int x), (override));
};

// A basic test using GoogleTest.
TEST(BasicTest, SimpleAssertions) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
  EXPECT_EQ(5, 3 + 2);
}

// A simple GoogleMock test.
TEST(MockTest, MockFooBehavior) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue(_))
      .Times(AtLeast(1))
      .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(42, mock.GetValue(10));
  EXPECT_EQ(42, mock.GetValue(20));
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Explanation:

- The test validates basic assertion macro functionality.
- It defines a mock class for a simple interface and sets an expectation.
- Runs the tests through the standard GoogleMock initialization.

---

## 3. Compiling the Validation Test

Building the test requires pointing the compiler and build system to your GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and libraries.

If you installed GoogleTest with CMake and your project uses CMake, add:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
find_package(GMock REQUIRED)

add_executable(quick_validation_test quick_validation_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(quick_validation_test GTest::gtest GMock::gmock_main pthread)  # pthread on Linux/macOS
```

Alternatively, for a manual `g++` command line on Linux/macOS assuming `googletest` source is in `third_party`:  

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Ithird_party/googletest/include -Ithird_party/googlemock/include \
  quick_validation_test.cc \
  -Lthird_party/build/lib -lgtest -lgmock -lgmock_main -pthread -o quick_validation_test
```

> **Note:** Adjust include and library paths according to your setup.

---

## 4. Running the Test and Expected Output

Run the compiled test binary:

```bash
./quick_validation_test
```

Expected output resembles:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 2 test cases.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from BasicTest
[ RUN      ] BasicTest.SimpleAssertions
[       OK ] BasicTest.SimpleAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from BasicTest (0 ms total)

[----------] 1 test from MockTest
[ RUN      ] MockTest.MockFooBehavior
[       OK ] MockTest.MockFooBehavior (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from MockTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 2 test cases ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

- Tests should pass without failures or errors.
- The GoogleMock test confirms that mocking is functional.

## 5. Common Validation Issues and Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Compilation Problems

- **Missing headers:** Verify include paths for `gtest/` and `gmock/` headers are correctly specified.
- **Undefined references:** Check that your linker flags include `-lgtest`, `-lgmock`, and `-lgmock_main` in proper order.
- **C++ standard:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock require C++17 or later. Ensure compiler option `-std=c++17` or equivalent is set.

### 5.2 Linker Errors

- Link the pthread library on POSIX systems by adding `-pthread` or `-lpthread`.

### 5.3 Runtime Failures

- Verify you call `::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` in `main()`
- Confirm any mock objects have virtual destructors to avoid undefined behavior.

### 5.4 Test Runs but No Output or Only Partial Output

- Ensure tests are actually registered (using the `TEST` macro correctly).
- Confirm that the test binary runs in a console or environment allowing stdout display.

## 6. Best Practices for Validation

- Maintain a small, minimal validation test like the example above in your repository for quick checks.
- Run these validation tests after upgrades or environment changes.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get detailed mock call logging if debugging mock-related test failures.

## 8. Additional Tips

<Tip>
If you receive warnings about "Uninteresting mock function call," it means methods were called without expectations set. If these calls are intentional, suppress warnings with `NiceMock` or an additional `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `gtest` and `gmock` namespaces explicitly when needed to avoid ambiguity in tests.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For advanced debug information, run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed traces of mock calls and expectations.
</Tip>
