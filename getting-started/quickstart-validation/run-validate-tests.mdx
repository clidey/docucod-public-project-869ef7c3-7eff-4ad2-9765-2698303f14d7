# Running and Validating Tests

This guide details how to execute the test binaries included with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, interpret their output, and verify that your testing environment is correctly configured for productive Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflows.

---

## 1. Running Test Binaries

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide pre-built test binaries you can run directly to confirm your build and environment are functioning correctly.

### Step-by-Step Execution

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Test Binary">
Identify the test executable that was built during installation or your project build. Common names are `gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, or `gmock_main`, depending on what was built and linked.

Typically, these binaries are found in your build directory or output folder used by your build system (e.g., `build/` for CMake).
</Step>
<Step title="Open a Terminal or Command Prompt">
Navigate to the directory containing the test binary.

Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/build/directory
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Test Binary">
Execute the test binary.

Example:
```bash
./gtest_main
```

Or on Windows:
```batch
gtest_main.exe
```

Expected output includes lines such as:
```plaintext
Running main() from gtest_main.cc
[==========] Running X tests from Y test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
...
[  PASSED  ] N tests.
```
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret the Output">
The test binary output reports:

- Which tests ran, grouped by test suites
- Pass/fail status of each test
- Summary of overall success or failure

A successful test run ends with zero failures, and the return code of the binary is `0`.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Running Tests on Special Platforms

For specialized platforms like Arduino-like systems (ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52), tests run within `setup()` and `loop()` functions instead of `main()`. The system continuously runs all tests in the main loop. Refer to platform-specific documentation for execution nuances.

## 2. Verifying Installation and Environment Readiness

To ensure your GoogleTest/GoogleMock installation is correct and ready for development:

### Basic Verification Steps

1. **Build and run sample tests** provided in the `googletest/samples` directory if available.
2. Confirm the test binary returns exit code `0` after a successful run:

```bash
./gtest_main; echo $?
```
An output of `0` indicates success.

3. If you see test failures, review test output to identify issues, such as linking errors or missing dependencies.

4. If your test binary does not run or crashes, verify your environment meets all system requirements, including C++17 compiler support and necessary runtime libraries.

### TDD Workflow Readiness

- Check that your test setup supports quick incremental compilation and execution.
- Ensure your test runner properly parses command-line flags for selective test execution.
- Confirm you can automate test runs using `make test`, `ctest`, or IDE integrations.

<Tip>
Use the sample tests as a baseline to confirm your tooling and environment before writing new tests. This saves time troubleshooting environment issues later.
</Tip>

## 3. Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest produces structured output that includes:

- **Test suite and test case names**: identifies what was tested
- **Success or failure status**: `[  PASSED  ]` or `[  FAILED  ]`
- **Failure messages with file and line number**: pinpoint issues for rapid debugging
- **Summary lines**: number of tests run, passed, or failed

Example snippet after running tests:

```plaintext
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (2 ms)
/path/to/test_file.cc:23: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(3)
    Which is: 5
  6
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

This output enables you to quickly locate failing tests and understand failure reasons.

## 4. Running Tests Selectively and Passing Arguments

You can pass command-line flags to the test binary to control test execution:

- Run specific tests or groups:

```
./gtest_main --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
```

- List all tests without running them:

```
./gtest_main --gtest_list_tests
```

- Make tests output in XML format for CI systems:

```
./gtest_main --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

Refer to the [Advanced Guide on Test Control](/guides/core-testing-workflows/test-control) for a full list of command-line options.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Running Tests">
<Accordion title="Test Binary Does Not Execute or is Not Found">
- Verify your build artifacts directory.
- Ensure executable permissions are set on the test binary.
- Rebuild your tests and check for build errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Fail with Linking Errors">
- Confirm that your test executable links with `gtest_main` or defines a valid `main`.
- Check that all dependencies (like pthreads) are linked properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="No Tests Are Run, Output Indicates Zero Tests">
- Verify that test sources are compiled and linked with your test binary.
- Ensure your test functions use `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros correctly.
- Check `gtest_filter` flags are not excluding all tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Output Is Not Clear or Hard to Interpret">
- Use verbose flags like `--gtest_verbose=info`.
- Redirect output to a file for easier searching.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

- After confirming your tests run correctly, proceed to write your own tests using the [Create Your First Test](/getting-started/quickstart-validation/first-test-creation) guide.
- Explore GoogleMockâ€™s functionality for mocking and expectations after mastering test execution.
- Integrate test runs into your development environment or continuous integration system.

For direct access to the source of the default `main()` function used in tests, see the implementation files [gtest_main.cc](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/src/gtest_main.cc) and [gmock_main.cc](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/src/gmock_main.cc).


<Check>
Ensure every test execution terminates with an exit status 0 for success.
In automated workflows, this exit code is the primary indicator of test health.
