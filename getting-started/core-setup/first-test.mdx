# Your First Test: Quick Success

Welcome to your first step with GoogleTest! This guide will walk you through writing, building, and running your very first unit test using GoogleTest. By following this practical example, you will quickly gain confidence in your environment setup and see immediate results.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have accomplished the following:

- Installed GoogleTest on your system. If you haven't, please refer to the [Installation (All Supported Platforms)](/getting-started/core-setup/installation-platforms) guide.
- Set up your C++ compiler environment fully supporting C++17 or later.
- Have a working understanding of basic C++ compilation and linking.

<Tip>
If you are new to C++ unit testing, we recommend reviewing the [GoogleTest Primer](/overview/product-intro/what-is-googletest) to familiarize yourself with core concepts.
</Tip>

## 2. Writing Your First Test

Let's create a minimal test case with GoogleTest.

1. Create a new C++ source file named `example_test.cc`.
2. Include GoogleTest headers and write a simple test:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Sample function to test
int Square(int x) {
  return x * x;
}

// Define a test case named "MathTest" and a test named "Square".
TEST(MathTest, Square) {
  // Check that Square(3) == 9
  EXPECT_EQ(Square(3), 9);
  // Check that Square(-4) == 16
  EXPECT_EQ(Square(-4), 16);
}
```


This simple test validates the correctness of the `Square` function for two sample inputs.

## 3. Building Your Test

You can build your test executable using your preferred build system. Here's a quick example using *g++* on Linux/macOS:

```sh
# Compile the test source
# Replace the paths to your googletest includes and libraries accordingly
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread \
    example_test.cc /path/to/googletest/lib/libgtest.a \
    /path/to/googletest/lib/libgtest_main.a -o example_test
```

For CMake users, create a simple `CMakeLists.txt` like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(ExampleTest)

# Find GoogleTest package
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

add_executable(example_test example_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(example_test ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)
```

Then build:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

<Tip>
Use the [Supported Platforms & Build Systems](/overview/integration-ecosystem/supported-platforms) page for detailed integration instructions with various build tools.
</Tip>

## 4. Running Your Test

Run your test executable:

```sh
./example_test
```

### Expected Output

If everything is set up correctly, you will see output similar to:

```output
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from MathTest
[ RUN      ] MathTest.Square
[       OK ] MathTest.Square (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from MathTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms that your test ran successfully and the checks passed.

<Tip>
If the test fails, check the error messages carefully and verify your code logic and build settings. See the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-issues) guide for additional help.
</Tip>

## 5. Extending Your Test

Now that you see your first success, try the following:

- Add more test functions in the same source file using the `TEST` macro.
- Experiment with other assertion macros like `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_EQ`, and `EXPECT_NE`.
- Follow the [Writing Your First Test](/guides/getting-started/first-test) guide for deeper examples.

## 6. Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest outputs a clear summary of the test run, including:

- Number of tests executed.
- Pass/fail status for each test case.
- Detailed failure information if any test fails.

The output is designed to help you quickly pinpoint problems in your code or test setup.

## 7. Next Steps

- Explore writing test fixtures and parameterized tests to structure more comprehensive tests.
- Learn about assertions and matchers in the [Using Assertions and Matchers Effectively](/guides/core-workflows/rich-assertions).
- For mocking dependencies, start with the [Integrate Mocking with GoogleMock](/guides/getting-started/integrate-mocking) guide.
