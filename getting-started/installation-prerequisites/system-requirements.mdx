# System Requirements

Understand the minimum supported compilers, platforms, and C++ standard required to run GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. Quickly check if your environment is compatible before proceeding.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms and compilers following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Before starting, ensure your environment matches the compatibility requirements below:

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows (Desktop, MinGW), Mac OS X (including iOS)
- **Compilers:**
  - GCC (generally version 5 or later recommended)
  - Clang
  - MS Visual C++ (Visual Studio 2015 or newer required)
  - Intel LLVM
  - SunPro
  - IBM Visual Age / XL

> Visit the [Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for detailed and up-to-date compiler and platform versions.

## 2. C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17** or later.

- Ensure your compiler supports C++17 and that it is explicitly enabled.
- In CMake, use the following in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt` to specify this:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If not using CMake, add appropriate compiler flags to enable C++17, for example:

```bash
# GCC / Clang
-std=c++17

# MSVC
/std:c++17
```


## 3. Threading and Concurrency Support

GoogleTest is designed to be thread-safe where **pthread** is available and enabled.

- On POSIX systems (Linux, MacOS), pthread support is usually detected and enabled automatically.
- On Windows, native threading primitives are used.

You can check thread safety by inspecting the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` after including `<gtest/gtest.h>`; a value of `1` confirms thread-safe operation.

### Enforcing pthread usage

- If GoogleTest does not detect pthread correctly, define one of these macros in your compiler flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1    # Force-enable pthread
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0    # Disable pthread
```

- If pthread is used, your compiler and linker commands need to include `-pthread` or the platform-specific flags that link to pthread libraries. CMakeâ€™s GoogleTest build script handles this automatically.

## 4. Compiler and Build Tools Notes

Ensure your build environment meets the following:

- Use compilers that meet the minimum requirements (see section 1).
- For MSVC users on Windows:
  - GoogleTest links statically to the C runtime by default.
  - If your project links dynamically, use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align runtimes and avoid linking errors.

## 5. GoogleMock Requirements

GoogleMock is bundled with GoogleTest and shares its environment requirements:

- Same C++17 requirement and platform/compiler support.
- GoogleMock requires at least MS Visual C++ 2015 if using MSVC.

When building GoogleMock with CMake, it is included by default unless disabled explicitly with `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.

## 6. Common Environment Compatibility Pitfalls

- **C++ Standard:** Not setting C++17 or higher will cause build errors.
- **Runtime mismatches (Windows):** Mixing static and dynamic runtimes leads to linker errors. Sync runtimes by setting `gtest_force_shared_crt` accordingly.
- **Lack of pthread flags on Unix:** Missing `-pthread` leads to unresolved symbols during linking.
- **Older compiler versions:** Do not support needed C++17 features or produce errors.

<Tip>
Always confirm your development environment adheres to these minimum requirements before attempting to build or run GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

## 7. Summary Table of Key Requirements

| Requirement                            | Details                                   |
| -------------------------------------| -----------------------------------------|
| Minimum C++ Standard                  | C++17                                     |
| Supported Platforms                  | Linux, Windows (Desktop & MinGW), Mac OS X (including iOS) |
| Supported Compilers                  | GCC 5+, Clang, MSVC 2015+, Intel LLVM, SunPro, IBM Visual Age |
| Thread Safety                       | Enabled if pthread supported (mostly Linux/macOS), native on Windows |
| Runtime linkage (Windows)           | Static by default, dynamic linkage possible with `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option |

## 8. Verification and Next Steps

After confirming compatibility:

- Proceed to the [Installation](../installation-prerequisites/installation-methods) guide to build and install GoogleTest and GoogleMock in your environment.
- Consult the [Supported Platforms & Integrations](../../overview/architecture-features-integration/supported-platforms-integration) page for detailed platform-specific notes and integration tips.
- For troubleshooting environment issues, see [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/common-setup-issues).
