# Running and Validating Tests

GoogleTest test programs are your gateway to validating your code through automated tests. This guide walks you through running your test binaries, understanding the output GoogleTest generates, and confirming that your test setup is correctly operating.

---

## 1. Running Your Test Binary

Once you have built your test executable (e.g., `my_test_binary`), you can run it directly from the command line.

### Basic Execution

Run your tests simply by invoking the executable:

```bash
./my_test_binary
```

This runs *all* tests registered in your binary.

### Using GoogleTest Flags

GoogleTest supports multiple command line flags to control which tests run, how results are displayed, and output formatting. All flags start with `--gtest_`. To see a list of all supported flags and their usage, run:

```bash
./my_test_binary --help
```

Key flags include:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--gtest_filter=Pattern` | Run only tests matching the filter pattern.
| `--gtest_list_tests` | Lists all tests without running them.
| `--gtest_repeat=N` | Runs tests N times to catch flaky tests.
| `--gtest_shuffle` | Runs tests in random order to detect dependencies.
| `--gtest_color=(yes|no|auto)` | Controls colored output.
| `--gtest_output=xml:path` | Generates an XML report of results.

### Running a Subset of Tests

You can filter tests by name using the `--gtest_filter` flag with wildcard patterns. For example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.*
```

runs all tests in the `MySuite` test suite.

To exclude tests, prefix with a `-` pattern:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=* -MySuite.FlakyTest
```

### Environment Variables

Instead of flags, you can set environment variables with the same functionality, e.g., `GTEST_FILTER` or `GTEST_OUTPUT`.

---

## 2. Interpreting Test Output

GoogleTest provides a human-friendly textual output from which you can quickly gain insights about the tests run, their success or failure, and timing.

### Sample Output Overview

```none
[==========] Running 4 tests from 2 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from WidgetTest
[ RUN      ] WidgetTest.DoesStart
[       OK ] WidgetTest.DoesStart (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] WidgetTest.DoesStop
[  FAILED  ] WidgetTest.DoesStop (1 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from WidgetTest (1 ms total)

[----------] 2 tests from WidgetExtraTest
[ RUN      ] WidgetExtraTest.IsVisible
[       OK ] WidgetExtraTest.IsVisible (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] WidgetExtraTest.IsHidden
[       OK ] WidgetExtraTest.IsHidden (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from WidgetExtraTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 4 tests from 2 test suites ran. (2 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] WidgetTest.DoesStop

 1 FAILED TEST
```


#### Breakdown of Output

- `[==========]` indicates the start and end of the entire test run.
- `[ RUN      ]` marks the start of an individual test.
- `[       OK ]` indicates a test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ]` indicates a test failed.
- Summary at the end provides totals of passed/failed tests and overall runtime.

### Understanding Failures

For failed tests, GoogleTest prints the sub-statements/assertion failures that caused the test to fail, including file names, line numbers, and expression values.

### Colored Output

GoogleTest automatically uses colors to highlight passed tests (green) and failed tests (red) when output goes to a terminal. You can control coloring using the `--gtest_color` flag.

---

## 3. Success Criteria: Confirming Your Setup Works

You know your GoogleTest integration is working correctly when:

- Running your test executable runs all defined tests without errors related to GoogleTest itself.
- Tests show output similar to the example above, listing running tests with `[ RUN      ]`, passing tests with `[       OK ]`, and failures (if any).
- The final summary shows the correct number of tests passed or failed.

If you get errors such as "no tests found" or unexpected crashes, revisit your project configuration and test registration.

---

## 4. Advanced Test Running Techniques

### Listing All Available Tests

To see all tests registered in your binary without running them:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

This helps you discover test names when filtering or debugging.

### Running Tests Repeatedly

To help identify flaky or intermittent failures, you can repeat tests:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_repeat=100
```

To stop on the first failure during repeats, add:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_repeat=100 --gtest_break_on_failure
```

### Generating Reports

GoogleTest can output XML or JSON reports in addition to console output, useful for CI integrations:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

or

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_output=json:report.json
```

These reports contain detailed information including test duration and failure messages.

### Running Disabled Tests

Tests or test suites prefixed with `DISABLED_` are skipped by default. To run them explicitly:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

You can combine this with filters.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No tests run or zero tests reported:**
  - Verify that your tests are correctly defined using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
  - Ensure test files are included and linked correctly.

- **Unexpected test failures:**
  - Check your assertions and test setup for mistakes.
  - Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to easily debug failures.

- **Output is cluttered or hard to read:**
  - Use `--gtest_brief=1` to show only failures.
  - Disable timestamps or times with `--gtest_print_time=0`.

- **Test executable crashes immediately:**
  - Confirm `testing::InitGoogleTest()` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.

If you encounter platform-specific issues, refer to the [Supported Platforms and Compatibility FAQ](../faq/core-questions/supported-platforms-faq) or the Troubleshooting sections.

By following these instructions and leveraging GoogleTest's powerful options, you can confidently validate your C++ code and have a clear understanding of your testing results.

## Example: Running Your First Tests

Here's a quick example assuming your test binary is `sample_test`:

```bash
# Run all tests
./sample_test

# Run only tests in FooTest suite
./sample_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.*

# Run tests and generate an XML report
./sample_test --gtest_output=xml:report.xml

# List all available tests
./sample_test --gtest_list_tests
```

If all tests pass, expect the final output line:

```none
[  PASSED  ] N tests.
```

If any tests fail, build confidence by inspecting failure messages directly in the console or in the report files for detailed diagnostics.
