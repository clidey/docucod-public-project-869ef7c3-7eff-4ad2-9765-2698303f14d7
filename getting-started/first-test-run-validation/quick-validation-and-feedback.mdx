# Quick Validation & Feedback

Welcome to the Quick Validation & Feedback guide. This page is designed to help you quickly verify that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation is correctly set up and functioning as expected by running a simple sample test suite, interpreting the output, and addressing common issues you might encounter during test execution.

---

## 1. Running Sample Tests for Validation

### Step 1: Locate Sample Test Binaries

After building GoogleTest, you will typically have sample test executables available. These are found in the `googletest` test directory or a similar location within your build output.

- Example test binaries include `gtest_sample_test` and `gmock_sample_test`.
- If you built GoogleMock as part of GoogleTest, these tests will be included.

### Step 2: Execute a Sample Test

Run a test executable from your command line to observe a successful test run.

```bash
./path/to/gtest_sample_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from SampleTestSuite
[ RUN      ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest1
[       OK ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest1 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest2
[       OK ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest2 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest3
[       OK ] SampleTestSuite.SampleTest3 (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from SampleTestSuite (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
```

### Step 3: Observe Test Behaviors

- All tests should pass; failures indicate setup or build issues.
- Exact test names and counts may vary depending on the test binaries.

## 2. Understanding the Test Output

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide rich output that can be used to verify test success and diagnose issues.

### Key Output Sections:

- `[ RUN      ] TestSuite.TestName`: Indicates a test starting.
- `[       OK ] TestSuite.TestName`: Indicates a passing test.
- `[  FAILED  ] TestSuite.TestName`: Indicates a failing test.
- `[==========]`, `[----------]`: Summary lines for starting and ending runs.

### Common Messages:

- **Uninteresting mock function call**: Means a mock method was called without explicit expectations but it is treated as allowed. Warning but not failure.
- **Unexpected mock function call**: The test saw a mock function call that does not match any declared expectation, which is a failure.
- **Mock function called more times than expected**: Occurs if a method is invoked beyond its expected cardinality.


<Tip>
For detailed understanding of mock warnings and errors, see the [Troubleshooting Mock Failures](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md#troubleshooting-mock-failures) section.

## 3. Running Tests with Verbose Mock Output

For deeper insights when developing or debugging tests, you can enable verbose logging from GoogleMock.

Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag when running your tests:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This will print detailed traces of all mock function calls, including which expectation each call matched and stack traces.

## 4. Diagnosing Common Issues

| Symptom                         | Likely Cause                                   | Resolution                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tests fail to run or binary missing | Build incomplete or tools misconfigured       | Rebuild GoogleTest and verify installation |
| Tests run but report unexpected mock calls | Missing or misconfigured EXPECT_CALLs          | Review tests to add proper expectations     |
| Uninteresting call warnings     | Mock method called without expectations       | Use `NiceMock` to suppress or add EXPECT_CALL with `Times(AnyNumber())` |
| Multiple failures for expectations | Test may call methods in wrong order or excess times | Use `InSequence()` for order enforcement or check call counts |
| Mock leaking warnings at exit    | Mock objects not properly deleted              | Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional or manage object lifecycle carefully |

<Tip>
Enable verbose logging and review the call traces to pinpoint call mismatches or ordering errors.

## 5. Links to Sample Tests and Output Examples

- Sample test source: `googletest/samples/sample1_unittest.cc` demonstrates basic tests.
- Mock test source: `googlemock/test/gmock_output_test_.cc` contains tests covering expected failures and mock warnings.
- Mock output log: `googlemock/test/gmock_output_test_golden.txt` shows real-world expected test output and error messages.

Refer to these files in your source directory or online repository to see exemplar tests and their output.

## 6. Next Steps After Validation

- If your tests run and pass, proceed to writing your own test fixtures and mocks.
- Explore the guides:
  - [Writing Your First Test](writing-your-first-test.md)
  - [Mocking Your First Method](mocking-your-first-method.md)
- Learn more about assertion styles and matchers in the [Using Assertions and Matchers Effectively](using-assertions-and-matchers.md) guide.
- Visit [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](common-setup-errors.md) if problems occur.
