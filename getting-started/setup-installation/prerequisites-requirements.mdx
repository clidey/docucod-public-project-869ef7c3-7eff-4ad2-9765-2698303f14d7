# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your development environment is fully compatible with GoogleTest and GoogleMock before starting. This page details the essential prerequisites, supported platforms, compiler standards, and key external dependencies you must have to build and run tests using these frameworks effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are cross-platform testing frameworks designed to work on a wide range of operating systems including:

- Linux distributions
- macOS
- Windows
- BSD variants
- QNX (partial compatibility noted)

For exact compatibility and nuances, refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation.

<Note>
GoogleTest does not officially support Fuchsia, and MinGW does not support pthreads, so special considerations may be needed for these platforms.
</Note>

---

## 2. Compiler Requirements

To build GoogleTest and GoogleMock, your C++ compiler **must** support **C++17** or a later standard. This requirement ensures compatibility with language features used extensively across the codebase.

The following compiler versions and vendors are actively supported:

- GCC (G++ 7.0 or later recommended)
- Clang
- MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 or later)
- Intel LLVM Compiler
- Other common C++ compilers supporting C++17

### Key Compiler Settings

- The build scripts and CMake configuration explicitly set the compiler standards to C++17 using flags such as `-std=c++17`.
- On Windows, GoogleTest defaults to using static runtime libraries but offers an option to switch to shared runtimes to avoid linkage conflicts (see below).

<Check>
Always ensure that your build environment is configured to target C++17:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

If exceptions or RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) are disabled in your project, special build flags may be required. GoogleTest can be built with or without exceptions and RTTI depending on your needs.
</Check>

## 3. Essential External Dependencies

While GoogleTest is a self-contained testing and mocking framework, it does have a few important external dependencies in some scenarios:

### POSIX Thread Library (pthreads)

- GoogleTest is thread-safe when pthreads are available and enabled.
- On systems where pthreads are not available or disabled, GoogleTest falls back to platform native threading solutions, such as Windows threading.

You can force-enable or disable pthread support with compiler macros:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # disable
```

The CMake build automatically detects pthread availability and links it appropriately.

### Abseil and RE2 (Optional)

- GoogleTest can integrate with Abseil (an open-source C++ Common Libraries project by Google) and RE2 (regular expression library) for enhanced features.
- These integrations are optional and require separate installation and availability in your build system.
- Enable these integrations with the CMake option `-DGTEST_HAS_ABSL=ON`.

<Note>
If you enable Abseil and RE2 support, ensure your build environment has these libraries installed and discoverable by CMake.
</Note>

---

## 4. Build System Requirements

### CMake

- Minimum required version: **3.13** (some features, like `FetchContent`, need 3.14 or later).
- GoogleTestâ€™s CMake build scripts configure compiler flags and dependencies automatically, helping ensure compatibility.

### Bazel

- GoogleTest supports Bazel as a build tool, with predefined `BUILD.bazel` files included.
- Bazel users must configure their WORKSPACE and targets accordingly to include GoogleTest source and dependencies.

---

## 5. Recommended Configuration for Windows Users

Windows users should be mindful of runtime library linkage:

- By default, GoogleTest links C++ runtime statically (`/MT`), whereas many Visual Studio projects link it dynamically (`/MD`).
- To avoid linker errors caused by mismatched runtimes, enable the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to force dynamic runtime linkage.

Example to enable dynamic runtime with CMake:

```bash
cmake -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON ..
```

## 6. Summary of Key Prerequisite Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate your platform and OS">
Confirm your operating system is supported: Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD, or QNX.
</Step>
<Step title="Ensure your compiler supports C++17">
Check your C++ compiler version and set the C++ standard to at least 17.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify pthread availability (if applicable)">
Ensure pthread support is enabled or configure macro flags as needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Install optional dependencies if enabling Abseil/RE2">
Download and configure Abseil and RE2 if planning to enable enhanced GoogleTest features.
</Step>
<Step title="Choose and prepare your build system">
Install CMake 3.13+ or Bazel and prepare your build configuration accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="For Windows users">
Decide if static or dynamic runtime linkage is needed and configure accordingly.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues in Setting Up Prerequisites">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Ensure you have an up-to-date compiler installed. Older versions will lack required support. Upgrade your toolchain or use a newer compiler.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="pthreads Missing or Not Linked Properly">
Check if your environment has pthreads installed. If CMake fails to find pthreads on Unix systems, you can force-enable or disable by adding `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`. On Windows, pthreads are not used.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows Related to Runtime Libraries">
Switch between static/dynamic runtimes via the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option. Inconsistent runtime linkage causes common LNK2038 errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Abseil or RE2 Not Found When Enabling Support">
Ensure that the dependencies are installed and their CMake package files are visible to your build system. Configure `find_package` paths or environment variables as needed.
</Accordion>

## Additional Resources & Next Steps

- Visit the [Installation: CMake & Bazel](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-cmake-bazel.md) page for detailed instructions on building.
- Review the [Configuration & Environment Setup](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/setup-installation/configuration-setup.md) guide to configure build options.
- For hands-on testing, proceed to [Create Your First Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/quickstart-validation/first-test-creation.md).

<Tip>
Preparing your environment carefully is the critical first step to a smooth experience with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Verify each prerequisite comprehensively before moving on.
