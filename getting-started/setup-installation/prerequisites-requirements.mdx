# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the essential system requirements and dependencies you need to satisfy before successfully building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Ensuring your development environment complies with these prerequisites will streamline your experience and avoid compatibility issues.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). It supports a variety of major platforms including:

- **Linux** (including various distributions and architectures)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants)
- **Mac OS X** and iOS
- Other UNIX-like systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, and more

For an up-to-date list of supported compilers, operating systems, and build tools, refer to the official compatibility matrix [here](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

> **Tip:** Always verify your platform and compiler versions against this matrix to ensure full support.

---

## 2. Compiler Requirements

To build GoogleTest, your compiler must support at least **C++17**.

### Recommended Compiler Versions:

- **GCC**: Version 7 or higher
- **Clang**: Version 5 or higher
- **MSVC**: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later

Older compiler versions or partial C++17 support might lead to build failures or subtle bugs.

> **Note:** GoogleTest employs specific C++17 features such as `std::string_view` and structured bindings, which mandate modern compiler capabilities.

---

## 3. Development Dependencies

Before building GoogleTest, ensure the following development tools are installed:

### Build Systems

- **CMake** (recommended), version 3.14 or higher
- **Bazel** (optional), for users who prefer it as their build system

### Required Libraries and Tools

- A C++17-compliant standard library
- POSIX tools and utilities (for UNIX-like platforms)
- Git (if cloning the repository)

### Optional Dependencies

- **GoogleMock**, bundled within GoogleTest sources and built by default with CMake unless explicitly disabled

> **Tip:** When using CMake to build, GoogleMock is included unless you specify `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.

---

## 4. Environment & Network Requirements

- No special network ports or firewall settings are required for running tests.
- Internet access is necessary only if you fetch dependencies dynamically, such as via CMake `FetchContent` or external submodules.

---

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before building or integrating GoogleTest:

1. Verify your compiler version supports C++17 and is properly installed.
2. Confirm that CMake or Bazel is installed and accessible from your command line.
3. On UNIX-like systems, ensure you have standard POSIX utilities available.
4. Check disk space and available RAM meet the needs of building C++ code efficiently.

```bash
# Check GCC version
gcc --version

# Check Clang version
clang --version

# Check MSVC version (Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt)
cl

# Check CMake version
cmake --version

# Check Bazel version (optional)
bazel --version
```

> **Warning:** Using unsupported or outdated compilers might cause cryptic errors during build. Always update your tools when possible.

---

## 6. Tips and Common Pitfalls

- When building on Windows, consider the runtime linkage to avoid linker errors related to static vs dynamic runtimes. Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` if your project uses dynamic CRT.
- Ensure that no non-default constructors without default constructors exist in test fixtures (a common cause of build failures).
- Avoid mixing test suites with similar names but different fixture classes within the same namespace.
- Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` in your tests to avoid template-related incompatibilities.

---

## 7. Where to Go Next

Once your environment satisfies these requirements, proceed to the installation instructions in [Installation: CMake, Bazel, and Manual Integration](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-modes.md).

For configuring your project and writing your first tests, see:

<Check>
Make sure your compiler provides full C++17 support before starting.
Ensure CMake >= 3.14 is installed for easiest build experience.
Double-check your platform is in the list of supported platforms.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem:** Compiler errors about missing C++17 support
- **Solution:** Upgrade your compiler to a version supporting C++17 or switch to Clang/GCC as applicable.

**Problem:** Linking failures related to CRT mismatch on Windows
- **Solution:** Use the `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` CMake option to sync CRT linkage.

**Problem:** Tests not running or fixtures failing to instantiate
- **Solution:** Ensure all test fixtures have accessible default constructors.
Verify no conflicting test suite definitions exist.
