# Prerequisites & Requirements

Before integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your development workflow, it is essential to ensure your environment meets the foundational requirements. This section outlines supported platforms, minimum compiler versions, required C++ standards, and third-party dependencies to prepare your system for smooth installation and operation.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock target a wide range of development environments to support most needs, including but not limited to:

- Windows (various versions, including Windows 10 and later)
- Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS)
- macOS
- Embedded systems with supported C++ compilers

While these platforms are supported, functionality and build processes may vary slightly. Users should verify compatibility with their specific OS versions.

---

## Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a compliant C++ compiler supporting at least the C++11 standard. The following compilers and minimum versions are recommended:

- **GCC** 4.8 or later
- **Clang** 3.3 or later
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** 2015 or later

Additionally, the compiler must support C++11 features such as lambdas, `auto`, `nullptr`, and move semantics, as GoogleMock extensively uses these in mocking and expectation mechanisms.

<Warning>
Using compilers that do not fully support C++11 or with missing standard library features will lead to build errors or runtime failures. Please ensure your compiler version meets the minimum requirements.
</Warning>

---

## C++ Standard

The minimum required C++ standard for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock is **C++11**. Users must configure their build system appropriately to enable C++11 or later standards.

For example, with **GCC** or **Clang**, add the flag:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 ...
```

For **MSVC**, set the project to use the default language standard that supports C++11 or later (Visual Studio 2015 and onwards do this by default).

<Note>
Using newer standards like C++14 or C++17 is supported and may offer improved compiler diagnostics and feature support but is not mandatory.
</Note>

---

## Third-Party Dependencies

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be standalone and require minimal external dependencies:

- **Standard C++ Library**: Required for all standard features and STL usage.
- **Threads Support**: Some features make use of threads (e.g., synchronization in GoogleMock). Ensure your build environment supports threading (e.g., POSIX threads on Linux/macOS or Windows threads).

The build scripts or package configuration files (`gmock.pc`, `gmock_main.pc`) handle linking pthreads on platforms where applicable.

<Check>
When building/linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock, ensure linking against the thread library is enabled. For example, you might see `-pthread` or its equivalent included automatically.
</Check>

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows**: Users should ensure the Windows SDK and necessary Visual Studio components are installed for C++ development.
- **Embedded or limited environments**: Some systems may not fully support all features of GoogleTest/GoogleMock, especially those involving thread support or exceptions.

---

## Permissions and Access

No special permissions or user accounts are required for basic use. However, your development environment must allow execution of build tools (e.g., CMake, Ninja, or your chosen build system) and any necessary compiler tools.

---

## Summary

Before attempting installation or running tests with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, verify that:

- Your platform is supported.
- You have a compatible C++11-compliant compiler at or above the stated versions.
- Your build environment is configured to use C++11 or later.
- Thread support is present and correctly linked.

Properly setting up your environment sets the stage for successful compilation and execution of tests, ensuring you can fully leverage the powerful mocking and testing capabilities of GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter compilation errors related to language features, verify the compiler version and flags.
- On platforms that require explicit linking of `pthread` or similar threading libraries, confirm these are included in your build.
- For integration issues with build systems, refer to the Integration Overview documentation for guidance.

<Tip>
Ensuring your development environment meets these prerequisites will save time and frustration during installation and testing. When in doubt, test compiler flags and versions by compiling a simple C++11 program.
