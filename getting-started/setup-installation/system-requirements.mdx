# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GoogleTest

This page outlines the essential system requirements and compiler environments needed to successfully build and run GoogleTest. Understanding these prerequisites ensures compatibility and avoids common setup pitfalls before you begin integrating GoogleTest into your C++ projects.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler environment. Attempts to build or use GoogleTest with earlier C++ standards will fail due to unavailable language features.

- **Compiler Flag**: Ensure your build sets the C++ standard to at least C++17.
- **Example CMake setting**:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

> You can verify this requirement by checking that your compiler defines the macro `__cplusplus` with a value of at least `201703L`.

## 2. Supported Operating Systems & Platforms

GoogleTest automatically detects the environment for compatibility. It officially supports the following major platforms:

- **Windows** (Desktop editions including MinGW)
- **Linux** (Modern distributions, including Android via NDK for limited use)
- **macOS** (including iOS support for test code within simulator constraints)
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD**
- **Solaris, AIX, HP-UX**

Less common Unix-like platforms may work but have less rigorous support. If you encounter platform-related issues, consider reaching out to the GoogleTest community or check platform-specific documentation.

### Platform Detection Macros

When building, GoogleTest uses platform-specific predefined macros such as:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`
- `GTEST_OS_MAC`

These macros help GoogleTest enable or disable platform-specific features.

## 3. Compiler Version & Compatibility

GoogleTest works with a wide range of modern C++ compilers, provided they support C++17:

- **GCC**: Version 7 or newer recommended
- **Clang/LLVM**: Version 5 or newer recommended
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio)**: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or greater

> The build scripts enforce MSVC version checks; for example, Google Mock requires at least MSVC 2015.

## 4. Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest is designed to be thread-safe on platforms where threading primitives are available.

- On POSIX systems with pthreads (Linux, macOS, BSD variants), pthread support is enabled by default.
- On Windows, native Windows threading APIs are used.
- Embedded or constrained platforms without threading support can disable it with build options, but multi-threaded tests are not supported then.

If GoogleTest incorrectly detects threading availability, you can force it by defining:

```
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable
```

## 5. Filesystem and Stream Redirection

Certain GoogleTest features like death tests and output capturing rely on filesystem availability and support for stream redirection (e.g., `dup()`, `dup2()` on POSIX).

- Filesystem support is generally available on desktop platforms.
- Stream redirection is disabled on some mobile and embedded platforms.

Understanding these dependencies helps anticipate feature availability.

## 6. Exception and RTTI Support

GoogleTest adapts to environments with or without C++ exceptions and runtime type information (RTTI):

- Exceptions: GoogleTest can be compiled with exceptions both enabled and disabled.
- RTTI: GoogleTest detects RTTI availability and works accordingly.

You can control or detect these features via build macros like `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` and `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`.

## 7. Other Notable Prerequisites

- **Wide String Support**: GoogleTest provides partial support for `std::wstring`. Some older or embedded platforms may lack full support.
- **Death Test Style**: The default style is `'fast'`, but `'threadsafe'` can be enabled for more robust death tests, depending on platform characteristics.

## Practical Pre-build Checklist

1. **Verify compiler supports C++17**
   ```bash
   $ ${CXX} --version
   # or use CMake configuration to check CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD
   ```
2. **Confirm platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, macOS commonly)
3. **Ensure pthreads are available if using multi-threaded tests on POSIX**
4. **Adjust build macros if necessary** (`DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY`)
5. **Set C++ standard explicitly in build systems to avoid build errors**

<Tip>
Always confirm you have the matched compiler and C++ standard before starting your build. This avoids subtle incompatibilities or compilation failures.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using unsupported or too-old compilers will result in build errors. GoogleTest requires at least C++17 features.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Unsupported Compiler Version">
Ensure your compiler version is recent enough (e.g., GCC >= 7, MSVC >= 2017 Update 3). If necessary, upgrade your toolchain or adjust the C++ standard in build configurations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Not Detected on POSIX">
If GoogleTest fails to detect pthreads, explicitly define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` in your build flags.
Check your compiler/linker flags include `-pthread` where appropriate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Death Tests Not Working on Some Platforms">
Verify your platform supports file system operations and stream redirection.
Configure death test style via the `--gtest_death_test_style` flag if needed.
