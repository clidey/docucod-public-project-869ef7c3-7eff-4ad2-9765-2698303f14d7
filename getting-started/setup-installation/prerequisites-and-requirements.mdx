# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GoogleTest

To ensure a smooth installation and integration of GoogleTest into your C++ projects, it is critical to verify that your development environment meets GoogleTest's supported compilers, platforms, C++ standard requirements, and other dependencies. This page guides you through these foundational checks before proceeding with installation.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and supports the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (most recent distributions)
- **Windows** (Windows 7 and later, including Windows 10 and Server editions)
- **Mac OS X** (modern versions supported by latest Xcode)

If you develop on other environments such as embedded systems or special toolchains, ensure your platform supports the minimum compiler and C++ features listed here.

## 2. Supported Compilers and Toolchains

GoogleTest supports a range of modern C++ compilers that comply with the C++17 standard. Verify that your compiler meets at least the minimum version:

| Compiler                         | Minimum Supported Version |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| GCC                             | 7.0                       |
| Clang                           | 6.0                       |
| Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)  | Visual Studio 2017 (15.x) |

> **Tip:** Use the command `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or `cl` (for MSVC) to check the compiler version installed.

## 3. C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires an environment with **C++17 support** enabled.

- When compiling, pass the appropriate flag to enable C++17 features:

  - GCC/Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - MSVC: use the project settings to set the language standard to C++17 or `/std:c++17`

- Make sure your build system honors these flags.

> **Note:** Failure to compile with C++17 enabled will lead to build errors and is a common source of installation issues.

## 4. Dependencies

GoogleTest is a header-only library for the most part, with some optional source files for extensions. There are no external runtime dependencies for basic usage.

### GoogleMock

- GoogleMock is included in the GoogleTest repository.
- To use mocking features, include `<gmock/gmock.h>` alongside GoogleTest headers.

### Build Tools

- For building GoogleTest from source, ensure your environment includes:
  - A C++17-capable compiler
  - CMake 3.14 or newer (if building with CMake)

## 5. Network and System Requirements

No special network configuration is necessary to build or run GoogleTest.

- Ensure your firewall or security software does not interfere with local builds.

- If using GoogleTest in continuous integration (CI) environments, confirm that the CI system supports your compiler and C++17.

## 6. Access Requirements

- No special credentials or accounts are needed to download or use GoogleTest.

- Access to the internet may be needed only to clone the official repository or fetch the source code.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

- **Compiler does not support C++17:** Upgrade your compiler or configure your build to enable C++17.

- **Build system cannot find headers:** Verify your include paths point to GoogleTest directories.

- **Linking errors:** Confirm that libraries and object files are correctly linked, especially when integrating GoogleTest with GoogleMock or other subprojects.

- **Platform-specific quirks:** See the [Integration & Platform Support](../../overview/system-architecture-and-integration/integration-and-dependencies.md) page for platform-specific considerations.

## Summary of Checks Before Installation

| Requirement                  | Check Command / Action                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Operating system             | Confirm Linux/Windows/Mac OS X platform  |
| Compiler version & C++17 support | `gcc --version` or `clang --version` + build flag `-std=c++17` |
| Build tools (CMake)          | `cmake --version` (for CMake builds)     |
| Include paths & libraries    | Verify include/library paths in build system|

---

By confirming your environment meets these prerequisites, you lay the foundation for a successful GoogleTest installation and setup experience.

For next steps, proceed to the [Installing GoogleTest & GoogleMock](../installation-multiplatform.md) page to follow precise installation instructions.

<Tip>
Always verify compiler compatibility and C++17 support first to avoid common installation pitfalls.
</Tip>

<Note>
For detailed platform-specific integration and dependency details, please visit the [Integration & Platform Support](../../overview/system-architecture-and-integration/integration-and-dependencies.md) page.
</Note>

<Check>
Ensure you have:
- A supported platform and compiler with C++17 enabled.
- CMake 3.14 or later if using CMake.
- Correct build toolchain configuration for your environment.
</Check>
