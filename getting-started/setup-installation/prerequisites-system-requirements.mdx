# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before setting up and running GoogleTest, it is crucial to ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements. This guarantees that GoogleTest will compile and run correctly without unexpected build or runtime issues.

---

## 1. C++ Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest is a modern C++ testing framework that requires a compiler supporting at least **C++17** features. Compatibility with your compiler is essential:

- **Minimum C++ Standard:** C++17
- **Compiler Examples Known to Work:**
  - GCC 7.0 or newer
  - Clang 5.0 or newer
  - MSVC Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or newer
  - Intel C++ Compiler version supporting C++17

<Note>
Older compilers lacking full C++17 support may cause build failures or runtime issues.
</Note>

## 2. System and Platform Compatibility

GoogleTest is designed to be portable and runs on the major operating systems:

- Linux
- Windows
- Mac OS X

Ensure that your platform supports the compiler requirements and standard C++ build tools.

For thread-safety features, your system should have support for threads. GoogleTest relies on the POSIX threads library (`pthread`) on Unix-like systems where available. On Windows, native threading primitives are used.

<Warning>
Though GoogleTest is thread-safe where pthread is available, avoid invoking GoogleTest assertions concurrently from multiple threads on non-pthread systems to prevent undefined behavior.
</Warning>

## 3. Build Tools and Configuration

GoogleTest uses **CMake** as the primary build system. A working installation of CMake version **3.14 or later** is strongly recommended for the best integration and ease of setup.

- **Minimum CMake Version:** 3.14
- **Supported Build Tools:** Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.

<Info>
GoogleTest build includes GoogleMock by default. To build without GoogleMock, you can configure CMake with the option `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.
</Info>

## 4. Dependencies

There are no external library dependencies beyond a conforming C++17 compiler and standard libraries.

<Note>
If you are using the `pthread` library on Unix-like systems, ensure your linker and compiler commands include pthread support (e.g., `-pthread` flag for GCC/Clang).
</Note>

## 5. Compiler Flags and Settings

Certain compiler flags or environment configurations are recommended or enforced by default to ensure optimal build correctness:

- **C++ Standard Enforcement:** CMake sets `-std=c++17` or platform-equivalent.
- **Warning Levels:** Enhanced warning levels are enabled for stricter code quality.
- **Exception Support:** Exception handling should be enabled (required for GoogleTest).
- **RTTI Support:** Runtime Type Information (RTTI) should be enabled to support type-safe downcasting internally.

<Tip>
On MSVC, ensure you use at least Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.7) with appropriate CRT linkage configuration for compatibility with GoogleTest.
</Tip>

## 6. Memory and Disk Space

- **Disk Space:** Only a few megabytes are required for the source and build files.
- **Memory:** GoogleTest is lightweight; typical build systems should allocate at least 512 MB RAM for building to avoid slowdowns.

## 7. Access Requirements

- Ability to clone or download the GoogleTest repository from GitHub.
- Permissions to install CMake and a suitable C++ compiler on your system.
- Appropriate permissions to write build and output directories.

## Verifying Your Environment

To confidently verify your setup:

1. Check your compiler version and C++ standard support:

```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version
# Check C++ standard support
echo | gcc -x c++ -std=c++17 -E - >/dev/null && echo "Supports C++17" || echo "C++17 not supported"
```

2. Check CMake version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

3. Verify pthread availability on Linux or Mac:

```bash
ldconfig -p | grep pthread
```

(Typically pthread is available by default on these platforms.)

<Warning>
If your platform is missing these requirements, GoogleTest may not build, or tests may fail to execute properly.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Compiler Too Old or Lacking C++17 Support

- **Symptom:** Build errors referencing missing language features or standard library errors.
- **Resolution:** Upgrade your compiler to a version supporting C++17.
- Use GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or appropriate MSVC version.

### Missing pthread Library

- **Symptom:** Link errors related to pthread symbols.
- **Resolution:** Install pthread libraries or specify `-pthread` flags as needed.
- On MinGW, pthreads may not be supported. GoogleTest automatically uses Windows threading primitives in this case.

### CMake Version Too Low

- **Symptom:** `FetchContent_MakeAvailable` or other CMake commands fail.
- **Resolution:** Upgrade CMake to 3.14 or later.

### Runtime Errors Related To Exception or RTTI Support

- **Symptom:** Errors about missing exception or RTTI support.
- **Resolution:** Ensure compiler flags enable exception handling and RTTI.
- For GCC, flags like `-fexceptions -frtti` should be passed.

## Summary

Meeting the above prerequisites ensures a smooth experience when installing and running GoogleTest. It provides a stable foundation to start writing and executing your C++ tests effectively.
