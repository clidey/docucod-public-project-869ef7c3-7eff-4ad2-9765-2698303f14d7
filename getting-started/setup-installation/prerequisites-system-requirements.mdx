# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the necessary criteria before installing and using GoogleTest. This preparation prevents common compatibility issues and enables smooth integration with your C++ projects.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest adheres strictly to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). It supports a wide range of **operating systems**, **compilers**, and **build tools** as outlined below:

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Linux
  - Windows (Desktop, MinGW)
  - macOS
  - Additional support exists for platforms like FreeBSD, Solaris, and embedded targets with varying stability.

- **Compiler Requirements:**
  - Must support **C++17** or later
  - Commonly supported compilers include:
    - GCC 7.0 and newer
    - Clang 3.4.1 and newer
    - MSVC 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) or later

- **Threading Support:**
  - GoogleTest detects and utilizes **pthread** on most Unix-like platforms as available
  - On Windows, native threading primitives are used

You can find an official, up-to-date supported platform and compiler matrix here:

[GoogleTest Supported Platforms Table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

> <Info>Testing on less common platforms or using older compilers may work but is not guaranteed. For stability and best experience, stick to supported combinations.</Info>

---

## 2. Compiler & Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++ compiler that:

- Fully supports **at least C++17 standard**, including features like constexpr, inline variables, and structured bindings.
- Provides **RTTI** (Run-Time Type Information) optionally but strongly recommended for advanced GoogleTest features.
- Supports **exceptions** if your test code or tested code relies on them (GoogleTest can work with exceptions disabled but some features then may have limitations).

> <Tip>GoogleTest automatically detects compiler capabilities but may fail if the environment is unusual. You can override feature macros such as `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=1` to force-enable where needed.</Tip>

---

## 3. System Dependencies

Before installing GoogleTest, ensure the following system components and libraries are available:

- **C++ Standard Library:** Compatible with C++17
- **Threading Libraries:** 
  - On POSIX systems: `pthread` library installed
  - On Windows: native Windows threading primitives are used
- **File System Access:** GoogleTest requires access to the file system for test artifacts and temporary files.
- **Build Tools:**
  - For building GoogleTest itself, you need a build tool that supports the platform and C++17 (e.g., Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, Xcode).

---

## 4. Environment & Network Requirements

- No special network connectivity is required for GoogleTest runtime.
- For downloading GoogleTest sources (e.g., via GitHub) or automated fetching systems, ensure internet access and Git installed.

---

## 5. Access Requirements

- You need **user permissions** to install software packages and build tools on your system if installing globally.
- No special credentials are needed to use GoogleTest itself.

---

## 6. Compatibility and Limitations

- GoogleTest supports **most popular platforms** well but has limited or unstable support on niche or embedded platforms.
- **Exceptions and RTTI disabled environments:** GoogleTest partially supports these, but some features like typed tests or death tests may not work fully.

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Ensure your compiler version matches the minimum required version for your platform (e.g., GCC 7+, MSVC 2017+).

Upgrade your compiler or use a different one compatible with C++17.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread Library on Linux">
Verify pthread is installed and linkable. You can install it via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev`).

Ensure you link your tests with `-pthread`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File System Access Errors">
GoogleTest requires the ability to create temporary files and directories.

Check file system permissions and available disk space.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Verification Steps

To verify your environment:

1. Confirm your compiler supports C++17:

```bash
$ ${CXX} --version
$ echo "int main() {auto [x,y] = std::pair<int,int>{1,2}; return 0;}" > test.cpp
$ ${CXX} -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test
$ ./test && echo "C++17 supported"
```

2. Check for pthread availability on Unix-like systems:

```bash
$ ld -lpthread --verbose
```

3. Confirm you have permissions to write to temporary directories:

```bash
$ touch /tmp/gtest_testfile && rm /tmp/gtest_testfile
```

## Summary
Preparing your environment to meet these prerequisites guarantees a stable foundation for building and running tests with GoogleTest. Proper system, compiler, and threading support form the backbone of GoogleTest's cross-platform functionality.

Start by verifying your system meets these requirements, then proceed with installation and configuration for your project.
