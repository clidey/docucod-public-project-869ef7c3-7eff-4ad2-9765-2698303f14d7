# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin installing and using GoogleTest, ensure your environment meets the following system requirements and prerequisites. This will guarantee a smooth setup and consistent test execution.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to run on a wide array of platforms, including but not limited to:

- **Operating Systems**: Linux, Windows, Mac OS X
- **Embedded Systems**: ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52 (Arduino environments)

Its cross-platform compatibility ensures you can write and run your tests on the platform that matches your development needs.

> **Tip:** Check your target platform compatibility especially when working on embedded environments.

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler with support for **C++17** standards or later. Supported compilers include:

- GCC (7.0+ recommended)
- Clang (5.0+ recommended)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.3) or later

If your compiler does not support C++17, you must upgrade or switch to a compatible compiler to successfully build and use GoogleTest.

> **Note:** GoogleTest relies on certain C++17 features, so partial support may cause build issues.

## 3. Language and Build Environment

- **C++ Standard**: Your build system must specify C++17 or higher (e.g., via `-std=c++17` compiler flag or equivalent).
- **Build Systems**: GoogleTest supports being built as a standalone project or embedded within larger CMake or Bazel projects.

### Building with CMake

- Use `cmake` to configure GoogleTest. By default, GoogleMock is included.
- Specify `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` if you want only GoogleTest.

Example build steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..    # Builds both GoogleTest and GoogleMock by default
make
sudo make install  # Optional system-wide install
```

> **Tip:** Ensure consistent compiler flags across your project and GoogleTest builds to avoid compatibility issues.

## 4. Threading and Synchronization

GoogleTest is thread-safe in environments where pthreads are available.

- On non-pthread platforms (e.g., some Windows scenarios), using GoogleTest assertions from multiple threads concurrently can lead to unsafe behavior.
- It is recommended to run assertions in the main thread when possible.

Your test code can run multi-threaded, but GoogleTest synchronizes appropriately during setup, teardown, and registration steps.

## 5. Networking & External Dependencies

- No explicit network or external dependencies are required for GoogleTest.
- Make sure your firewall, proxies, or network policies do not interfere with downloading source code or dependencies if using external fetch mechanisms.

## 6. Storage and Disk Space

Minimal disk space is required (under tens of megabytes), but ensure enough free space for source checkout and build artifacts.

## 7. Prerequisite Software

- **C++ Standard Library**: The standard library for your compiler supporting C++17 is mandatory.
- **Build Tools**: Make, Ninja, MSBuild, or other platform-specific build tools.

## 8. User Permissions

- You should have read/write permission on the source checkout and build directories.
- For installing system-wide (e.g., to `/usr/local/`), administrator (root) privileges are needed.

## 9. Environment Variables

- Optionally, configure environment variables like `CXX` to specify the compiler.
- No special runtime environment variables are required for GoogleTest.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

### Error: Unsupported Compiler Version

- Verify the compiler version supports C++17.
- Upgrade to a supported compiler or switch your build environment.

### Build Failures on Missing Headers or Features

- Confirm the compilerâ€™s C++17 flag is set.
- Check that standard libraries are correctly installed and available.

### Threading-related Test Failures

- Restrict your test assertions to a single thread.
- Validate thread-safe usage of GoogleTest APIs.

### Network Access Issues When Fetching Sources

- Ensure `git` or `cmake` fetching tools have network access.
- Configure proxy settings if behind corporate firewalls.

---

## Additional Notes

- GoogleTest integrates tightly with GoogleMock; both are built together by default.
- For faster compilation times, consider compiling mock class constructors and destructors separately.
- Windows users: Be mindful of DLL runtime mismatches; use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime libraries.

---

## Summary

Having the right compiler support, build environment, and platform compatibility is crucial before you start building and running GoogleTest. Proper thread management and up-to-date compiler toolchains will ensure your testing environment is robust and reliable.
