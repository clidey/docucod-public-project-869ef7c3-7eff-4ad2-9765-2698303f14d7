# Validating Your Installation

Ensure your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation is working correctly by compiling and running the sample tests that come with the distribution. This step confirms that the libraries are properly built, linked, and ready for you to write your own tests with confidence.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have completed the following:

- **Built and installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock** according to the instructions in the [Installation Guide](../setup-and-installation/installation-on-linux-macos-windows.md).
- **Configured your build environment** (CMake, Bazel, or your preferred build system) to include GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and libraries.
- **Familiarity with running your build tool** to compile and execute tests.

<Check>
You must have at least one working test executable containing GoogleTest sample tests.
</Check>

---

## 2. Compiling the Sample Tests

GoogleTest ships with example test files that demonstrate typical usage and provide a quick validation for your installation.

Follow these steps:

1. **Locate the samples directory** inside your GoogleTest source tree. For example, `googletest/samples/`.
2. **Build the sample tests using your chosen build system.**
   - Using CMake:
     ```bash
     cd googletest
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```
   - Or using Bazel, see your platform's Bazel build instructions.
3. **Find the sample test executable(s)** produced after building.


---

## 3. Running the Sample Tests

Once compiled, run the sample executables to verify everything is set up correctly:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the sample test executable.
3. Run the executable, for example:

   ```bash
   ./sample1_unittest
   ```

4. Observe the output. You should see a summary indicating tests ran and which passed.

   Example output snippet:

   ```
   [==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
   [----------] Global test environment set-up.
   [ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesBlah
   [       OK ] SampleTest.DoesBlah
   [ RUN      ] SampleTest.HasProperty
   [       OK ] SampleTest.HasProperty
   [----------] 2 tests from SampleTest (0 ms total)

   [==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
   [  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
   ```

<Check>
If any test fails, re-check your installation and build steps.
</Check>

## 4. Understanding the Validation Output

The sample tests are designed with both passing and failing cases. During your validation run:

- **Passed tests** indicate that the core framework compiles and runs correctly.
- **Intended failures** are expected and demonstrate GoogleTest's ability to report failures clearly.

Typical messages include:

- `[  PASSED  ] <test name>` for tests that succeed.
- `[  FAILED  ] <test name>` along with detailed diagnostics for tests that fail.
- Summary lines showing the number of tests run, passed, failed, and skipped.

<Note>
The validation tests include intentional failures to verify error reporting. Seeing some failed tests during validation is normal.
</Note>

---

## 5. Common Issues During Validation

If the sample tests do not compile or run properly, consider the following:

- **Linking errors:** Confirm that GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are correctly linked.
- **Include path issues:** Ensure your compiler can find the GoogleTest headers.
- **Threading libraries:** GoogleTest requires threading support; missing pthread or related libs can cause problems.
- **Conflicting builds:** Avoid mixing different versions or incompatible builds of the framework.

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../first-test-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues.md).


---

## 6. Next Steps

After successfully validating your installation:

- Proceed to [Writing Your First Test](../first-test-and-validation/writing-your-first-test.md) to create your own test cases.
- Explore [Using GoogleMock: Basics](../first-test-and-validation/using-googlemock-basics.md) to add mocking capabilities.
- Learn how to [Run and Interpret Test Results](../first-test-and-validation/running-and-interpreting-test-results.md) for effective debugging.

## 7. Summary

This page guided you through validating your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation by compiling and running the sample tests. Successfully completing this step ensures your environment is correctly configured and ready for testing your C++ code.


---

## Code Example: Running Sample Tests

Here is a simple example of running the sample tests in a Unix-like environment:

```bash
cd googletest/build   # Or wherever your build directory is
./sample1_unittest
```

Expected terminal output:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.DoesBlah
[       OK ] SampleTest.DoesBlah
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.HasProperty
[       OK ] SampleTest.HasProperty
[----------] 2 tests from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

If you see output similar to the above, your GoogleTest installation is validated.

## Troubleshooting Common Validation Problems

<Accordion title="Sample Test Fails to Compile">
- Verify `GTEST_ROOT` and include paths.
- Check that GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are built.
- Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or later.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linker Errors">
- Confirm linked libraries include pthreads on Linux/macOS.
- Check your linker flags include `-lgtest -lgmock -lpthread`.
- Search for multiple conflicting versions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Executable Does Not Run or Crashes">
- Ensure runtime dependencies and environment variables are set.
- Check for threading support and correct library versions.
- Run with verbose flags or in debugger to gather info.
</Accordion>
