# Quick Validation Checklist

Ensure your GoogleTest installation is correct and your tests are discoverable and runnable with this concise validation checklist. Follow the commands and checks below to sanity-check your environment, test registration, and output correctness.

---

## 1. Verify Installation and Build

- **Check Compiler & Environment:**
  - Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or higher.
  - Verify GoogleTest headers and libraries are accessible.

- **Build Your Test Binary:**
  Use your build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel) to compile your test executable.

- **Verify Binary Exists:**
  - Locate the executable (e.g., `my_test`) after build.


## 2. Discover Registered Tests

Run your test binary with the flag to list all tests, verifying that GoogleTest can discover all registered tests.

```shell
./my_test --gtest_list_tests
```

You should see output like:

```
FactorialTest.
  HandlesZeroInput
  HandlesPositiveInput
QueueTest.
  IsEmptyInitially
  DequeueWorks
```

If this output is empty or missing expected tests:

- Confirm tests are linked into the binary.
- Check test fixture and `TEST` / `TEST_F` macro usages.


## 3. Run All Tests and Check Pass/Fail Status

Execute your tests to ensure they run and pass as expected:

```shell
./my_test
```

Expected output includes:

- **Test execution progress:** Lines like `[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput`
- **Success indications:** Lines like `[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput`
- **Summary:**

```
[==========] 6 tests from 2 test suites ran.
[  PASSED  ] 6 tests.
```

**Note:** If any tests fail, review failure messages and stack traces for diagnostics.


## 4. Run a Single Test

To isolate issues or validate a single test, run by name:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
```

Verify that only this test runs, and that it passes.


## 5. Check Output Formatting and Messages

- Confirm that failure messages (if any) are clear and include expected vs actual values.
- Use verbose output for deeper insight:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_verbose=info
```


## 6. Repeat Tests for Stability

To check for flaky tests, run multiple iterations:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_repeat=100
```

This helps ensure tests pass consistently.


## 7. Debug Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Validation Issues and Fixes">
<Accordion title="No Tests Discovered">
- Ensure your test code is compiled and linked into the executable.
- Check that each test uses `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` with proper test suite and test names.
- Confirm the naming conventions (avoid underscores in test and suite names).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Run but Always Fail">
- Examine failure messages carefully.
- Use `--gtest_verbose=info` to get detailed matching information.
- Verify that your assertions have the correct expected and actual parameters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Binary Not Found or Build Errors">
- Verify your build system points to correct GoogleTest include paths and libs.
- Confirm compiler version and standard flags (e.g., `-std=c++17`).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 8. Optional Advanced Validation

- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to stop on first failure for debugging.
- Enable XML report generation:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

- Run tests with disabled tests included:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

- Shuffle test order to reveal dependencies:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_shuffle
```

### Practical Example

```shell
# List all tests
./my_test --gtest_list_tests

# Run all tests
./my_test

# Run a single test
./my_test --gtest_filter=QueueTest.DequeueWorks

# Repeat tests 10 times
./my_test --gtest_repeat=10

# Generate XML report
./my_test --gtest_output=xml:results.xml
```
