# Running Tests

Discover how to build and execute tests, interpret output, and manage test binaries using GoogleTest's test runner. This guide helps you run single and multiple tests efficiently with confidence.

---

## 1. Preparing to Run Your Tests

Before running tests, ensure that your test program is properly built with GoogleTest linked and all tests are correctly registered.

- Verify your test binary is compiled and linked as described in the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/setup-and-installation/installation-guide).
- Ensure the tests are defined using the appropriate macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()`.
- Confirm test registration occurs before running tests (usually automatic with macros).

<Tip>
Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` early within your `main()` function to initialize GoogleTest and parse command-line flags before executing tests.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Running All Tests

Run the entire suite of tests compiled into your test binary with a simple call:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` executes all registered tests and returns `0` if every test succeeds, or `1` if any test fails.
- Tests run independently, isolating results.
- Execution order is undefined unless explicitly shuffled or filtered.

>>> **Success Criteria:** All tests run and their results are reported. Exit code `0` indicates success.

---

## 3. Running Selected Tests

### Using Command-Line Filters

GoogleTest supports filtering tests by name via `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run all tests matching 'FooTest' suite
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=FooTest.*

# Run tests with names containing 'Handles' in any test suite
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=*Handles*

# Run all but exclude tests ending with 'Slow'
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=* - *Slow
```

Filters use wildcard patterns:
- `*` matches zero or more characters
- `?` matches exactly one character

<Tip>
Combine positive and negative filters using `-` to quickly isolate relevant tests.
</Tip>

### Running Disabled Tests

Disabled tests (prefixed with `DISABLED_`) are excluded by default. To run them, use:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

---

## 4. Running Tests with Repeats and Shuffling

### Repeat Tests

For flaky or timing-sensitive tests, repeat execution multiple times:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_repeat=100
```

- `-1` means repeat indefinitely.
- Combine with `--gtest_break_on_failure` to halt on first failure.

### Shuffle Tests

Randomize the order tests are executed in to detect test dependencies:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_shuffle
```

- Use `--gtest_random_seed=SEED` to specify a fixed seed for repeatability.

---

## 5. Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest prints informative results for every test run:

```
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput (0 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

- `[ RUN ]` indicates a test is executing.
- `[ OK ]` means test passed.
- `[ FAILED ]` means test failed.

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_brief=1` to suppress outputs for passing tests and focus on failures.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Running Tests Programmatically: Invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

- Call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` only once per program execution.
- The return value should be the program's exit code.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  // You can perform custom actions based on 'result' here.
  return result;
}
```

---

## 7. Advanced Running Options

### Listing Tests Without Running

To list all available tests and exit:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

---

### Stop On First Failure

Halt test execution immediately upon the first failure:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_fail_fast
```

---

### Running Tests in Parallel (Sharding)

Split tests among multiple machines/processes using these environment variables:

- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: total number of shards.
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: index of the current shard (0-based).

GoogleTest will distribute test suites so each shard runs a disjoint subset.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Encountered While Running Tests">
<Accordion title="Test Binary Does Not Run or Is Missing">
Check that your test executable is properly built and the executable permission is set.

Verify your build process completes without errors, and GoogleTest is linked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Are Not Detected/Run">
Confirm that tests are defined using the proper macros, and that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is invoked.

Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to see which tests the runner detects.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Filtering Tests Returns No Matches">
Check the exact test suite and test names using `--gtest_list_tests`.

Remember filters are case-sensitive and respect glob syntax.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cannot Run Disabled Tests">
Ensure you specify the `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag when running.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 9. Next Steps

- Once tests run successfully, explore writing tests with fixtures (`TEST_F`) or parameterized tests (`TEST_P`).
- Learn about advanced assertions and matchers in the [Assertions Reference](/api-reference/gtest-core-api/assertions-reference).
- Delve into mocking with GoogleMock in the [Mocking Basics](/guides/real-world-workflows/mocking-basics) guide.
- Integrate tests in your CI pipeline as outlined in [Integrating with CI/CD Pipelines](/guides/integration-and-advanced/ci-integration).

Make sure your test environment is set up correctly before running tests.
Use appropriate command line flags for filtering, repeating, or sharding tests.
Review test output carefully to identify issues.
