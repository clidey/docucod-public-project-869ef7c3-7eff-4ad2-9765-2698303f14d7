# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

This page provides a concise list of frequent issues users encounter during the setup and integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, paired with actionable solutions. It empowers you to resolve build errors, linking problems, and missing dependencies quickly to overcome initial blockers and get your tests running smoothly.

---

## 1. Build Errors and Missing Dependencies

When integrating GoogleTest or GoogleMock, build errors related to missing headers, unresolved symbols, or incompatible compiler settings are common. Use the following steps to diagnose and fix these issues.

### 1.1 Ensure Required Dependencies Are Installed
- Verify that your system has a compiler supporting at least C++17.
- Confirm CMake or Bazel (depending on your build system) is properly installed and configured.
- Check that any needed development tools like `make`, `ninja`, or equivalent are available.

<Tip>
Always start by ensuring your build environment meets GoogleTest’s prerequisites as detailed in the [Prerequisites and System Requirements](../setup-and-installation/prerequisites-and-system-requirements) guide.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Correctly Include GoogleTest and GoogleMock Headers
- For mocks, include `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` to access mock facilities.
- For core testing, include `#include <gtest/gtest.h>`.

<Note>
Mixing or missing these includes can cause compilation failures or missing symbols during linking.
</Note>

### 1.3 Linking Issues
- When linking test binaries, ensure that both the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are linked if you use mocks.
- If using CMake, link with `gtest` and `gmock` targets explicitly.

Example CMake snippet:
```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test GTest::gtest GTest::gmock GTest::gtest_main)
```

<Tip>
If you build GoogleTest as part of your project via FetchContent or submodules, ensure you also propagate the include directories and dependencies correctly.
</Tip>

### 1.4 Handling Macro Conflicts
Certain system headers or third-party libraries may define macros with names overlapping GoogleMock methods (e.g., `Method`). To prevent such conflicts:
- Include GoogleTest/GoogleMock headers after system headers.
- Use `#undef` on conflicting macros before mocking, e.g., `#undef Method`.

<Warning>
Failing to address macro conflicts can cause compilation errors with no clear indication.
</Warning>

### 1.5 Platform and Compiler Specific Tips
- On MSVC, watch for warnings about const argument qualifiers; removing unnecessary const qualifiers in method parameters can help.
- When mocking methods with non-standard calling conventions (e.g., Windows `STDMETHODCALLTYPE`), specify this explicitly using the `Calltype(...)` qualifier.

## 2. Common Mocking Setup Issues

### 2.1 Mock Methods Must Be Virtual and Publicly Defined with `MOCK_METHOD`
- All mock methods need to mock virtual methods from the base class.
- Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro in the `public:` section regardless of the original method’s access level.

Example:
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
};
```

### 2.2 Handling Overloaded Methods
- Mock all overloads you intend to use, using `MOCK_METHOD` with correct signatures.
- Use `using BaseClass::MethodName;` to bring overloaded methods into scope if you mock only some overloads.

### 2.3 Mocking Move-Only Types
- For arguments or return types like `std::unique_ptr<>`, `MOCK_METHOD` supports them directly.
- Use lambdas to create and return new instances during mock calls if you want fresh objects instead of the same moved-from pointer.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, MakeBuzz(_))
    .WillRepeatedly([](StringPiece) {
       return std::make_unique<Buzz>(AccessLevel::kInternal);
    });
```

### 2.4 Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls
- An **uninteresting call** happens when a mock method is called without any `EXPECT_CALL`. By default, this causes a warning but not a test failure.
- An **unexpected call** happens when the call doesn't match any active `EXPECT_CALL`. This always causes a test failure.

<Info>
Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress uninteresting call warnings if they clutter your test output.
Use `StrictMock<T>` to treat uninteresting calls as failures, enforcing stricter verification.
</Info>

Example:
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoSomething());
// Other method calls are ignored without warnings.
```

### 2.5 Setting Default Behaviors and Expectations
- Use `ON_CALL(mock_object, Method(args))` with `.WillByDefault(...)` to specify default behaviors that don't enforce call counts.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(args))` to specify calls that must happen, with options for `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`.

<Tip>
Prefer setting default actions with ON_CALL and verify specific call expectations with EXPECT_CALL for clearer, maintainable tests.
</Tip>

### 2.6 Expectation Ordering and Sequences
- Use `InSequence` to enforce an order of expected calls within a scope.
- Use `.After()` or `.InSequence()` clauses to specify partial ordering constraints.

Example:
```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Execute());
}
```

### 2.7 Troubleshooting Mismatched Expectations
- If an expectation is not satisfied or a call is unexpected, run tests with the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed mock call traces.
- The verbose output shows the expected calls and the matching attempts, helping pinpoint mismatches.

<Tip>
Use the verbose flag for detailed diagnostics but switch back to default afterward to avoid clutter.
</Tip>

## 3. Verification and Cleanup

### 3.1 Automatic Verification on Destruction
- Mocks automatically verify expectations when destructed.
- If your mock objects persist beyond the test scope (e.g., heap-allocated and owned elsewhere), you can force verification explicitly:

```cpp
using ::testing::Mock;
Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

### 3.2 Avoid Leaking Mocks
- Leaked mock objects cause expect verification to be skipped silently.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_object);` if intentional.
- Always delete mocks at end of tests to ensure full verification.

<Warning>
Leaking mocks may cause your test to pass wrongly because expectations are not checked.
</Warning>

## 4. Sample Error and Troubleshooting Scenarios

### 4.1 Error: "Uninteresting mock function call encountered"

Cause: Mock method called without expectations.

Solution:
- Add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method()).Times(AnyNumber());` to explicitly allow calls.
- Alternatively, wrap your mock in `NiceMock` to suppress this warning.

### 4.2 Error: Missing `MOCK_METHOD` for a Virtual Method

Cause: Method is not mocked or mocked incorrectly.

Solution:
- Define the mock method in the `public:` section using `MOCK_METHOD` matching the base signature.

### 4.3 Error: Multiple `WillRepeatedly()` or `WillOnce()` Misuse

Cause: Multiple conflicting action clauses or wrong order.

Solution:
- Check that `.WillOnce()` precedes `.WillRepeatedly()` and each appears only once.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` if you want an expectation to deactivate after usage.

### 4.4 Error: Linking Errors for GoogleMock Symbols

Cause: Missing linking against `gmock` or incorrect build targets.

Solution:
- Confirm your build system links to both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries.
- Include GoogleMock headers and link GoogleMock library accordingly.

## 5. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Always keep destructors of interfaces virtual to allow safe mocking and deletion.
- Wrap complex or overloaded return/argument types with type aliases or parentheses in `MOCK_METHOD` macro to avoid parsing errors.
- Use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` when testing arguments with types that need explicit matcher casting.
- Use sequences or `.After()` clauses carefully to express precise call order dependencies without overspecifying.

## 6. Getting Further Help
