# Writing and Running Your First Test

Welcome to your first step with GoogleTest! This guide walks you through writing a minimal test case, compiling it, and running it to instantly confirm your setup works correctly. By following these instructions, you'll get a solid foundation to start writing and validating your own tests with GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets these essential requirements:

- **Compiler Support:** A C++17-compliant compiler (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+).
- **Build Tools:** A build system such as `make`, `CMake`, or Bazel configured to compile your project.
- **GoogleTest Integration:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock must be installed or vendored in your project.
- **Development Environment:** Access to a terminal or IDE where you can compile and run your tests.

<Check>
Make sure you have a working C++17 toolchain and GoogleTest is properly installed or integrated in your project (see Installation guides).
</Check>

## 2. Writing a Minimal Test Case

Your first test verifies that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly integrated and functioning.

### Step 1: Create a Test File

Create a file named `my_test.cc` (or any meaningful name) with the following contents:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>  // GoogleTest headers

// A simple test case named 'FirstTest' with one test called 'SimpleAssertion'.
TEST(FirstTest, SimpleAssertion) {
  // Use ASSERT_EQ to compare two values; if they differ the test fails.
  ASSERT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}
```

### Explanation
- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`: Defines a test case.
- `ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual)`: An assertion checking equality.

The test verifies that 1 + 1 correctly equals 2.

## 3. Compiling the Test

To compile the test, you must link it against the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.

### Example with `g++` and pkg-config

```bash
# Compile the test file
 g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /usr/include/gtest -isystem /usr/include/gmock \
     -pthread my_test.cc -lgtest -lgmock -lgtest_main -o my_test
```

**Note:** Replace include paths if your GoogleTest is in a different location.

### Using CMake

Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

target_link_libraries(my_test ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)
```

Then build using CMake commands.

<Info>
If you use Bazel or other build systems, refer to their specific integration guides.
</Info>

## 4. Running Your First Test

Once compiled, run your test executable:

```bash
./my_test
```

### Expected Output

```text
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from FirstTest
[ RUN      ] FirstTest.SimpleAssertion
[       OK ] FirstTest.SimpleAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from FirstTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms that GoogleTest is correctly working and your environment is set up.

## 5. Verifying Your Setup

### What Success Looks Like

- Test executable runs without errors.
- Your test passes with `[  PASSED  ] 1 test.`
- No runtime warnings or failures.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Compilation errors related to gtest/gmock includes or libraries">
Make sure the `-I` and `-l` flags point to the correct locations where GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and libraries reside. Check your installation or vendor paths.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors regarding pthread or stdc++">
GoogleTest depends on threading support. Make sure `-pthread` is passed in compile and link commands.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test executable runs but no tests are discovered">
Verify your test macro (`TEST`) syntax is correct and you have linked against `gtest_main` or provided a `main()` entrypoint.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

Now that you have a minimal test running:

- Explore writing more complex tests with assertions ([GoogleTest Assertions API](../api-reference/core-testing-apis/assertions-api)).
- Learn how to use GoogleMock for creating mocks in your tests ([Mocking with GoogleMock](../guides/core-testing-workflows/mocking-with-googlemock)).
- Consult the [GoogleTest Primer](../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/quickstart-primer.md) for an incremental learning path.
- If you encounter issues, see the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/troubleshooting.md) guide.

<Note>
The minimal test you wrote is a great proof-of-life for your setup and helps isolate build or environment problems early.
Always build and run this minimal test first after setting up GoogleTest/GoogleMock.
