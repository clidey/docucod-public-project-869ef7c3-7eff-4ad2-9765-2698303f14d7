# Verifying Installation

Ensure your GoogleTest and GoogleMock build and test environment is ready by performing quick validation steps. This guide provides actionable instructions using the provided sample tests and standard outputs to confirm a successful setup.

---

## 1. Confirm Successful Build

Before verifying the installation, ensure you have built GoogleTest and GoogleMock according to the installation instructions in the [Installation: All Platforms](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installation-platforms) guide.

If you built using CMake, a typical workflow is:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

On Windows, build with Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.


## 2. Run the Sample Tests Provided with GoogleTest/GoogleMock

The projects include unit tests to validate that the framework and your build environment work correctly.

### Steps:

1. Locate the test binaries generated during build, often named `gtest`, `gmock`, `gmock_main`, or similar.
2. Execute the test binary. For example:

```bash
./gmock_main
```

3. Observe the output. A successful test run will include lines similar to:

```text
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running X tests from Y test cases.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
...
[  PASSED  ] N tests.
[==========] N tests from Y test cases ran.
[  PASSED  ] N tests.
```


## 3. Using Your Own Simple Test to Verify Setup

If you want to verify the installation integrally, create a minimal test:

### Example minimal test file `sample_test.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple test case
TEST(SanityTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Build and run this test:

If using CMake, your `CMakeLists.txt` can link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`:

```cmake
add_executable(sample_test sample_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(sample_test gtest_main)
```

Then build and run:

```bash
./sample_test
```

You should see output indicating the test passed.


## 4. Interpreting Test Output

### Success Output

- Tests run count matches expected number.
- No test failures or errors are reported.
- The final status indicates `[  PASSED  ]` for all tests.

### Failure Output

- Individual test failure details appear with file/line number.
- Summary lists the number of failed tests.


## 5. Troubleshooting Common Validation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Verification">
<Accordion title="Test Binary Not Found or Not Built">
- Verify you ran the build commands correctly.
- Check your build directory for test executables.
- On Windows, search for `.exe` files like `gmock_main.exe`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Fail to Run or Immediate Crashes">
- Confirm you meet [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements).
- Check that your compiler supports C++17 and is properly configured.
- Ensure you linked against the correct libraries (`gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, `gmock_main`).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect or Unexpected Test Output">
- Verify you initialized GoogleTest in your `main()` with `InitGoogleTest()`.
- Confirm no multiple calls to `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your code.
- Check your command-line parameters; unrecognized flags can cause issues.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 6. Best Practices for Validation

- Always use provided test binaries immediately after building to catch issues early.
- Use the `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` libraries to avoid writing your own `main()` unless customization is necessary.
- Examine test output fully to verify all parts of your test suite ran.
- Integrate tests into continuous integration pipelines early to detect environment issues.


## 7. Next Steps After Successful Verification

- Proceed to [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-and-validation/writing-and-running-first-test) to write custom tests.
- Explore [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-test-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you encounter problems.
- Review [Configuration and Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/configuration-and-initial-setup) to customize test integration.

## Example Output

Running a sample test might produce:

```text
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SanityTest
[ RUN      ] SanityTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SanityTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SanityTest ran. (1 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms your test environment is properly set up and ready for more comprehensive testing.
