# Quick Validation and Troubleshooting

Ensure your GoogleTest installation works as expected by validating simple test results. This guide offers practical troubleshooting tips for common issues such as build errors, linking problems, and runtime misconfigurations to help you swiftly verify and maintain your GoogleTest setup.

---

## 1. Validate Your GoogleTest Installation

Before diving into writing complex tests, confirm that your GoogleTest setup is correct by running a simple test suite that verifies basic assertions and test execution.

### Step-by-Step: Running a Basic Test

1. **Create a simple test file:**

    Save the following as `basic_test.cc`:

    ```cpp
    #include <gtest/gtest.h>

    TEST(BasicTest, SimpleAssertions) {
      EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
      EXPECT_TRUE(true);
      EXPECT_FALSE(false);
      EXPECT_STREQ("hello", "hello");
    }

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
      ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
      return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
    }
    ```

2. **Compile the test:**

    Depending on your environment and build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel), compile `basic_test.cc` linking against GoogleTest libraries. For example, using g++ directly:

    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread \
      basic_test.cc /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a -o basic_test
    ```

3. **Run the test executable:**

    ```bash
    ./basic_test
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```none
    [==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
    [----------] Global test environment set-up.
    [----------] 1 test from BasicTest
    [ RUN      ] BasicTest.SimpleAssertions
    [       OK ] BasicTest.SimpleAssertions (0 ms)
    [----------] 1 test from BasicTest (0 ms total)

    [----------] Global test environment tear-down
    [==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
    [  PASSED  ] 1 test.
    ```

<Tip>
If the test fails to compile or link, verify that your include paths and linked libraries are correct according to your build system setup.

### Troubleshooting Common Validation Failures

<AccordionGroup title="Common Failures and Fixes">
<Accordion title="Build errors and missing headers">
**Symptoms:**
- Compiler cannot find `gtest/gtest.h` or related headers.

**Fixes:**
- Confirm GoogleTest source or installed header path is correctly specified in your include paths.
- For CMake, ensure you have linked the `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gtest_main` targets or included directories properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors related to undefined references">
**Symptoms:**
- Errors during linking referencing GoogleTest symbols.

**Fixes:**
- Link against GoogleTest libraries: `libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a` or the respective shared libraries.
- Confirm you link with `-pthread` or equivalent threading libraries.
- Ensure library order on the linker command line includes GoogleTest libs last.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests not running or no tests detected">
**Symptoms:**
- Running the test executable shows 0 tests run.

**Fixes:**
- Confirm tests are properly registered either via `TEST`/`TEST_F` macros or dynamic registration.
- For parameterized or typed tests, confirm correct instantiation macros are used.
- Verify you called `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Assertion failures in the sample test">
**Symptoms:**
- The simple validation test fails assertions unexpectedly.

**Fixes:**
- Ensure no modifications were made to the sample test code that would break the tests.
- Check the platform compatibility and compiler correctness.
- Confirm your environment does not unexpectedly affect the process behavior (e.g., locale, environment variables).
</Accordion>

## 2. Using GoogleTest Flags to Control Test Execution

GoogleTest provides a set of command-line flags to influence test execution and output. Use these to debug and validate your test runs.

### Useful flags for quick validation

- `--gtest_list_tests` : Lists all discovered tests without running them.
- `--gtest_filter=PATTERN` : Runs only tests matching the specified pattern.
- `--gtest_repeat=N` : Repeats all tests N times for stability checking.
- `--gtest_break_on_failure` : Stops execution at the first failure—helpful while debugging.
- `--gtest_color=yes|no|auto` : Controls colored output.

Example:

```bash
./basic_test --gtest_filter=BasicTest.* --gtest_repeat=3
```

<Tip>
Run `./your_test --help` to see a full list of GoogleTest flags supported in your build.
</Tip>

## 3. Quick Validation Checklist

Follow these practical steps if you encounter problems:

1. **Verify compilation and linking:** Make sure headers are found, and linking is successful.
2. **Run a simple test:** Use the example test shown above to verify basic functionality.
3. **Check environment and flags:** Confirm no environment variables or command-line flags interfere with discovery or execution.
4. **Increase verbosity:** Use flags like `--gtest_print_time=1` or `--gtest_brief=0` for detailed test output.
5. **Examine failure messages:** Use assertions’ failure messages and logs to identify issues.

## 4. Advanced Troubleshooting Tips

### Catching failures inside test helpers

If your assertion failures occur inside helper functions or subroutines, use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to the failure messages.

```cpp
void Helper(int value) {
  SCOPED_TRACE(testing::Message() << "Helper call with value=" << value);
  EXPECT_EQ(value, 42);
}

TEST(MyTest, UsesHelper) {
  Helper(43);
}
```

This helps identify the code path leading to a failure.

### Using `HasFatalFailure()` in test code

If your test calls subroutines that issue fatal failures using `ASSERT_*`, remember that fatal failures abort only the current function. Use `HasFatalFailure()` to detect such conditions and return early:

```cpp
void Subroutine() {
  ASSERT_EQ(1, 2);  // Fatal failure will return from Subroutine
}

TEST(MyTest, Example) {
  Subroutine();
  if (HasFatalFailure()) return;  // Don't continue if fatal failure occurred
  ...
}
```

### Dynamic test registration

GoogleTest supports registering tests programmatically if macros do not suffice. To do this, use:

```cpp
TestInfo* RegisterTest(
  const char* test_suite_name, const char* test_name,
  const char* type_param, const char* value_param,
  const char* file, int line, std::function<Test*()> factory);
```

This approach is useful for generating tests dynamically at runtime.

## 5. When All Else Fails – Getting Help

- Review the official [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) and [Assertions Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/assertions.md) for foundational knowledge.
