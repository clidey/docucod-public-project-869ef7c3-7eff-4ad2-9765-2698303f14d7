# Running and Interpreting Test Results

Guide users through executing their test suite and understanding standard output, including how to read pass/fail status and handle initial errors. Prepares users to confidently move forward with real development.

## 1. Running Your Test Suite

GoogleTest test executables are ordinary programs. Running them launches your entire test suite and prints results to standard output.

### Steps to Run Tests

<Steps>
<Step title="Build and Link Your Tests">
Make sure your tests are linked with the GoogleTest library or `gtest_main` (which provides a ready-made `main()`). Build your test binary as per your project’s build system.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Test Executable">
From your command line, execute your test binary:

```bash
./your_test_binary
```

This runs all registered tests automatically.
</Step>
<Step title="Optionally Use Command Line Flags">
Modify the run behavior with command-line flags:

- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`
- `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times.
- `--gtest_break_on_failure` to stop on first failure.
- `--gtest_list_tests` to list all available tests without running.

Run `./your_test_binary --help` to see all supported flags.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Ensure to call `::testing::InitGoogleTest()` in your `main()` before calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. This initializes flag parsing and is essential for flags to work correctly.
</Tip>

## 2. Understanding Standard Output

GoogleTest produces structured and color-coded output that clearly indicates the test run progress and results.

### Output Sections

- **Start and End Summary**: Indicates total test suites and tests run, plus how many passed or failed.
- **Test Execution Lines**: Show each test’s start and finish.
- **Failures and Errors**: Detailed messages for failing assertions, including file, line number, expected vs. actual values, and optional custom messages.

### Example Typical Output

```none
[==========] Running 3 tests from 2 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from MathTest
[ RUN      ] MathTest.Addition
[       OK ] MathTest.Addition (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] MathTest.Subtraction
[  FAILED  ] MathTest.Subtraction (1 ms)
/sample_test.cc:29: Failure
Value of: subtract(1, 1)
  Actual: 1
Expected: 0
[----------] 2 tests from MathTest (1 ms total)
[----------] 1 test from LogicTest
[ RUN      ] LogicTest.NonContradiction
[       OK ] LogicTest.NonContradiction (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from LogicTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 3 tests from 2 test suites ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] MathTest.Subtraction

 1 FAILED TEST
```

### Interpreting Output Details

- `[ RUN      ]` marks a test starting.
- `[       OK ]` marks a passed test.
- `[  FAILED  ]` marks a test failure.
- Location info helps you jump directly to the source of failure.
- Multiple failures in a test are reported sequentially.

<Note>
Using colored terminal output (enabled by default with `--gtest_color=auto`) improves readability of test results.
</Note>

## 3. Understanding Pass/Fail Status

### Test Results

GoogleTest marks tests as:

- **Passed**: All assertions succeed.
- **Failed**: One or more fatal or non-fatal assertions fail.
- **Skipped**: Tests explicitly skipped with `GTEST_SKIP()`.

### Exit Codes

Your test executable returns `0` if all tests pass, or `1` if any test fails. Use this in CI or automation to detect failures programmatically.

<Tip>
Always check the return code of your test executable. Ignoring it may lead to undetected test failures.
</Tip>

## 4. Handling Test Startup Errors and Initial Failures

Sometimes errors occur before or early in test execution. These may be caused by:

- Build or linking misconfiguration.
- Missing dependencies.
- Bugs in global/static initialization.

### How Startup Errors Appear

- GoogleTest emits error messages before test listing.
- The test binary may abort early, printing stack traces or error details.

### What to Do

- Verify that GoogleTest libraries and headers are properly included and linked.
- Check for build warnings or errors.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm test discovery works.
- Run with `--gtest_break_on_failure` under debugger to catch early failures.
- Review initialization code (`SetUpTestSuite()`, `Environment::SetUp()`) for issues.

<Warning>
Early test failures might be the result of fatal errors outside your test code. Investigate those before assuming test logic problems.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Using the UnitTest Reflection API (Advanced)

GoogleTest exposes an API to query test results programmatically at runtime.

Typical uses:

- Custom reporting or logging.
- Collecting metrics on test success and failure rates.

### Example: Print All Failures After Running Tests

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();

  auto& unit_test = *::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance();

  for (int i = 0; i < unit_test.total_test_suite_count(); ++i) {
    const ::testing::TestSuite* test_suite = unit_test.GetTestSuite(i);

    for (int j = 0; j < test_suite->total_test_count(); ++j) {
      const ::testing::TestInfo* test_info = test_suite->GetTestInfo(j);
      if (test_info->result()->Failed()) {
        std::cout << "Test failed: " << test_suite->name()
                  << "." << test_info->name() << std::endl;
        // Additional failure info could be printed here.
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

## 6. Tips and Best Practices for Test Execution

- Use test filters (`--gtest_filter`) to isolate failing tests during development.
- Enable `--gtest_repeat` for flaky test diagnosis.
- Keep an eye out for skipped tests (`GTEST_SKIP()`), which often indicate unmet preconditions.
- Use XML or JSON outputs (`--gtest_output=xml:filepath`) for integration with CI dashboards.
- Leverage `--gtest_break_on_failure` when debugging.
- Carefully review failure output line references for quick pinpointing.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Test Run Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues">  
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Discovered">  
- Confirm tests are linked and built into the executable.
- Run with `--gtest_list_tests` to see discovered tests.
- Ensure your test functions are named properly and registered (using `TEST` or `TEST_F`).
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Test Execution Stops Prematurely">  
- Check for fatal errors in static/global initialization.
- Run with `--gtest_break_on_failure` to trap the failure in a debugger.
- Validate external dependencies or environment setup.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Unclear Failure Messages">  
- Add custom failure messages using `<<` operator in assertions.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context when tests call helper functions.
- Implement custom printers for complex types.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Flaky or Intermittent Failures">  
- Use `--gtest_repeat` to reproduce failures.
- Evaluate test dependencies and shared resource usage.
</Accordion>  
</AccordionGroup>
