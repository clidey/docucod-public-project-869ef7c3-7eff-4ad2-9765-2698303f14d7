# Prerequisites & System Requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock

This page ensures you prepare a compatible environment by detailing the minimum required C++ standards, supported compilers, target platforms, and necessary tools needed to build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. Establishing this foundation is critical before proceeding with installation or writing tests.

---

## 1. Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require an environment that supports **C++17** or later.

- Ensure your compiler supports the C++17 standard.
- When using CMake, explicitly set the C++ standard in your top-level project:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- For projects without direct C++ support (e.g., C projects using GoogleTest for validation), pass C++ flags manually:

```bash
-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=c++17'
```


<Note>
Failing to use a compatible C++ standard will cause build failures.
</Note>

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to compile on:

- **GCC** (version supporting C++17)
- **Clang** (version supporting C++17)
- **MSVC** (Visual Studio 2017 or later recommended for full C++17 support)

Ensure that your compiler version fully supports C++17 features, including constexpr enhancements and template features.

<Warning>
Older compilers or incomplete C++17 support may lead to build or runtime issues.
</Warning>

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are **cross-platform** and have been tested on:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

Other UNIX-like OSes where compatible compilers exist are generally supported but may require environment-specific adjustments.

<Info>
Platform-specific build files are included for ease of use, such as Visual Studio solutions on Windows and Xcode projects on macOS.
</Info>

## 4. Required Tools

### Build System

GoogleTest integrates primarily with **CMake**, a popular cross-platform build system.

- **CMake minimum version:** 3.14 (required for `FetchContent` features used in GoogleTest)
- If you do not have CMake installed, download it at https://cmake.org/

### Compiler Toolchain

- On Linux/macOS: GCC or Clang
- On Windows: Visual Studio with C++ development workload

### Version Control

- Git is recommended to clone the GoogleTest repository from https://github.com/google/googletest

### Optional for Continuous Integration

- Package managers compatible with your platform (e.g., `apt`, `brew`, `vcpkg`)
- CI systems supporting CMake builds

## 5. Special Build Considerations

### Multithreading Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe if the **pthread** library is available on your system.
- On UNIX-like OSes, make sure to link with `-pthread`.
- If pthread detection fails, manually define:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

or

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

### Shared Library Build

- GoogleTest is usually built as a static library for simplicity.
- To build as a shared library (DLL on Windows), add:

```bash
-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

and make sure your linker creates a shared library.

- When compiling test binaries using the shared library, add:

```bash
-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

### Visual Studio Runtime Compatibility

- Visual Studio projects link C runtime dynamically by default.
- GoogleTest links runtime statically by default, which can cause runtime library mismatches.
- To fix, enable the dynamic runtime in GoogleTest builds with:

```bash
-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

## 6. Additional Environment Setup

### Macro Name Clashes

- GoogleTest macros can clash with other libraries.
- To avoid conflicts, you can instruct GoogleTest to rename specific macros.
- For example, to rename the `TEST` macro to `GTEST_TEST`, add:

```bash
-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
```

- This requires you to write `GTEST_TEST(...)` instead of `TEST(...)` in your tests.

## 7. Summary Checklist Before Proceeding

- [ ] Confirm C++17 support in your compiler environment.
- [ ] Have CMake v3.14 or newer installed.
- [ ] Use a supported compiler version (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- [ ] On Unix-like OS, confirm pthread library presence if multithreading is needed.
- [ ] Decide if you want GoogleTest as static or shared library and add the relevant flags.
- [ ] Configure Visual Studio builds to align runtime linkage if on Windows.
- [ ] Consider macro name clash options if including multiple conflicting libraries.

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues">
<Accordion title="C++17 Support Issues">
Check your compiler version and update if needed. Use `g++ --version` or `clang++ --version` to verify. On Windows, ensure Visual Studio 2017 or newer.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread Library">
On Linux/macOS, install pthread via your package manager if missing. Verify compiler flags include `-pthread`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CMake Version Too Old">
Upgrade CMake to at least version 3.14 to ensure all GoogleTest configuration features work correctly, especially `FetchContent`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Visual Studio Runtime Mismatch">
Enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` during GoogleTest build to match your project's runtime linkage.
</Accordion>

## Example: Verifying Compiler and CMake Versions

```bash
# Check C++ compiler version
g++ --version
clang++ --version

# Check CMake version
cmake --version
```

If your environment meets these requirements, you are ready to proceed with GoogleTest's installation and configuration.
