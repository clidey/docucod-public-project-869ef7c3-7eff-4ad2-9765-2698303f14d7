# Quick Validation Checklist

This checklist helps you quickly verify that your GoogleTest installation and test environment are correctly set up and working as expected. Running through these validation steps before proceeding ensures confidence to build and run more complex tests.

---

## 1. Confirm GoogleTest Installation

Make sure GoogleTest is installed or included correctly in your project and accessible to your build system.

### Step

- Locate your GoogleTest include directory (e.g., `googletest/include/gtest`) and libraries or built binaries.
- Verify your compiler and linker commands include the appropriate include and library paths.

### Outcome

You should be able to write and compile a minimal test program using `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` without errors.

---

## 2. Initialize GoogleTest in Your Main Function

GoogleTest requires initialization before running tests. This sets up internal state and processes command-line flags.

### Example

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Outcome

The program should compile and run without error, successfully initializing GoogleTest.

---

## 3. Run the Sample Test Suite

Write a simple test or use an example test to validate test discovery and execution.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  ASSERT_TRUE(true);
}
```

Compile and run the program. The output should indicate the test ran and passed.

Sample output snippet:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[       OK ] SampleTest.BasicAssertions
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

---

## 4. Validate Basic Command-Line Flags

Verify that common flags such as `--gtest_list_tests`, `--gtest_filter`, and `--gtest_fail_fast` are recognized and behave as expected.

### Steps

- Run your test binary with `--gtest_list_tests`
  - Confirm that it lists available tests without running them.
- Run your test binary with `--gtest_filter=SampleTest.BasicAssertions`
  - Confirm that only matching tests run.
- Run with `--gtest_fail_fast`
  - Confirm test execution stops on first failure.

### Expected Behavior

- Listing tests should print test names and exit.
- Filtering should run only selected tests.
- Fail fast should stop on first failure.

---

## 5. Check Flag Parsing and Defaults

GoogleTest internally parses flags and sets defaults. You can verify their status programmatically.

### Example Test

```cpp
TEST(FlagCheckTest, DefaultsAndModification) {
  EXPECT_FALSE(::testing::GTEST_FLAG(also_run_disabled_tests));
  EXPECT_FALSE(::testing::GTEST_FLAG(break_on_failure));
  EXPECT_EQ("auto", ::testing::GTEST_FLAG(color));
  
  // Modify a flag and verify change
  ::testing::GTEST_FLAG_SET(also_run_disabled_tests, true);
  EXPECT_TRUE(::testing::GTEST_FLAG(also_run_disabled_tests));
}
```

Compile and run. The test should pass successfully if flags are set and retrieved correctly.

---

## 6. Verify Exception Handling Behavior (If Exceptions Enabled)

If your build supports exceptions, you can verify that GoogleTest correctly catches them and reports failures.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsAndIsCaught) {
  EXPECT_THROW(throw std::runtime_error("error"), std::runtime_error);
  EXPECT_NO_THROW(int x = 5; (void)x;);
}
```

Running this test should pass and GoogleTest should not crash on exceptions.

---

## 7. Confirm Proper Assertion Macros Behavior

GoogleTest provides many assertions. Confirm at least the basic expectations.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(AssertionTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
  EXPECT_FALSE(false);
  EXPECT_EQ(5, 2 + 3);
  EXPECT_NE(5, 3);
  EXPECT_LT(1, 2);
  EXPECT_LE(2, 2);
  EXPECT_GT(3, 2);
  EXPECT_GE(2, 2);
  EXPECT_STREQ("hello", "hello");
  EXPECT_STRNE("hello", "world");
}
```

Run the test and confirm it passes without failures.

---

## 8. Use Predicate Assertions for Enhanced Debugging

Predicate assertions provide clearer failure messages when checking complex conditions.

### Example

```cpp
// A simple predicate function.
bool IsPositive(int x) { return x > 0; }

TEST(PredicateTest, ExpectPred) {
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, 5);  // Passes
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, -1); // Fails with clear message
}
```

### Predicate-Formatter Usage

You can write richer predicate formatters that return `AssertionResult` for descriptive failure output.

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " evaluates to " << n << ", which is not even.";
}
```

Use with:

```cpp
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, 3); // Fails with message including "3 is not even"
```

---

## 9. Check Output Formats and Logs

If you have enabled XML or JSON output (`--gtest_output=xml:filename` or `--gtest_output=json:filename`), confirm that output files are generated correctly.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If any of the above checks fail, consider:

- Confirming GoogleTest headers and libraries are correctly included.
- Checking your build configuration for compatibility (e.g., C++ standard, threading).
- Ensuring you call `InitGoogleTest()` before running tests.
- Verifying test macros are used as intended.
- Running tests with `--gtest_help` for flag options and diagnostics.
