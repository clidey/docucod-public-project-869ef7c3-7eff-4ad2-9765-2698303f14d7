# System Requirements

Ensure your development environment is ready to build, run, and test with GoogleTest. This page outlines precise compiler, platform, C++ standard, and dependency requirements that must be met before installation and usage.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms and compilers, providing portability across major operating systems and environments.

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows (Desktop, MinGW), Mac OS X, and several BSD variants.
- **Compilers:**
  - GCC (modern versions with good C++17 support)
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (VS 2017 Update 3 or later minimum)
  - Other common, standards-compliant C++17 compilers

> <Tip> For Windows users, note that Visual Studio 2015 or later is required, with VS 2017 Update 3 recommended for full compatibility. </Tip>

### Platform Nuances

- GoogleTest is fully portable and supports cross-compilation.
- Embedded or uncommon platforms might require custom tweaks.
- Some platform-specific macros and build flags help tailor GoogleTest for your environment.

See [Supported Platforms & Toolchains](/overview/integration-and-ecosystem/supported-platforms) for detailed information on platform-specific considerations.

---

## 2. C++ Standard Requirements

- GoogleTest requires **C++17** or newer to build and operate correctly.
- When building, ensure your build system or compiler flags enforce `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

### Why C++17?

The framework uses modern language features for better performance, enhanced type safety, and cleaner headers.

> <Warning> Attempting to build GoogleTest with earlier C++ standards will result in build errors. Make sure to configure your compiler and build system accordingly. </Warning>

---

## 3. Dependencies

- GoogleTest includes GoogleMock bundled in the source. When you build GoogleTest, GoogleMock is built alongside by default.
- **Build Tools:**
  - CMake for generating native projects is strongly recommended.
  - CMake version 3.14 or higher is required for advanced build features.
- **Threading Support:**
  - Platforms must support POSIX threads (`pthread`) or Windows threading APIs.
  - GoogleTest is thread-safe if your platform supports pthreads or Windows threads.

Configure your environment to link against pthreads on Unix-like systems as needed.

---

## 4. Compiler Settings and Build Flags

- Use standard-compliant compiler flags to specify C++17.
  - Example for GCC/Clang: `-std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra`
  - For MSVC: select appropriate toolset and standards support flags.
- On Windows, be mindful of runtime library settings:
  - GoogleTest by default links statically to the CRT.
  - To avoid runtime conflicts, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` option when building with CMake if your project uses dynamic CRTs.

---

## 5. File System and Stream Redirection

- GoogleTest requires an operational file system to run death tests and some test utilities.
- Stream redirection is supported on standard desktop/server platforms.

> <Note> Embedded or minimal environments without file systems or standard I/O support may not fully support certain GoogleTest features. </Note>

---

## 6. Runtime Environment and Execution

- GoogleTest can be run on platforms with console or GUI support.
- It produces test results with detailed stack traces and custom messages.
- Supports multi-threaded test execution with synchronization primitives internally.

## 7. Summary Table

| Requirement                 | Details                              | Notes                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Operating Systems            | Linux, Windows (including MinGW), Mac OS X, BSD variants | Embedded platforms may be limited  |
| Compilers                   | GCC, Clang, MSVC 2017 Update 3+    | Must support C++17                   |
| C++ Standard                | C++17 or later                     | Required for successful build       |
| Build System                | CMake 3.14+ suggested               | For ease of build and integration    |
| Threading                   | pthread or Windows threading       | Required for thread safety           |
| File System                 | Available for death tests, logging | Not usually an issue on desktops    |
| Runtime Library Linking     | Static by default; dynamic optional| Configure `gtest_force_shared_crt` on Windows if needed |

## 8. Verification of Environment Before Installation

Before installing GoogleTest, verify your environment with the following commands.

### Check Compiler Version and C++17 Support

```bash
# GCC
gcc --version
gcc -std=c++17 -o /dev/null -xc++ - <<<'int main(){return 0;}'

# Clang
clang --version
clang -std=c++17 -o /dev/null -xc++ - <<<'int main(){return 0;}'

# MSVC (Developer Command Prompt)
cl.exe
# check Visual Studio version and toolset support
```

### Check CMake Version

```bash
cmake --version
# Ensure version is >= 3.14
```

### Check pthread Availability (Linux/macOS)

```bash
ld --verbose | grep pthread
# or
pkg-config --exists pthread && echo "pthread available"
```

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common System Requirement Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Supporting C++17">
Make sure your compiler supports C++17. Update GCC to at least version 7, Clang to 5.0, or use Visual Studio 2017 or later. Verify compiler flags to enable C++17.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Support Missing">
On Unix-like systems, install development packages for pthreads if missing. On Windows, use supported Visual Studio toolsets.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="File System or Stream Redirection Problems">
GoogleTest requires a functional file system and I/O streams for full feature usage. On embedded platforms, some tests and features may be limited or unavailable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Due to Runtime Mismatch on Windows">
Use the CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align CRT linkage between your project and GoogleTest.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 10. Next Steps

Once your system meets these requirements, you can proceed to installation.

- See [Installing with CMake](/getting-started/installation-and-configuration/installing-googletest-cmake) for step-by-step build instructions.
- Refer to [Platform-Specific Setup](/getting-started/installation-and-configuration/platform-specific-setup) for environment-specific guidance.
- If you encounter issues during installation or test execution, consult [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-test-and-validation/troubleshooting) for targeted help.
