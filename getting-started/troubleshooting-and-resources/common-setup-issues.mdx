# Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

GoogleTest offers a reliable and flexible unit testing framework, but occasional setup and configuration hiccups can slow down your onboarding. This guide helps you quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve common installation and integration problems you may experience during GoogleTest setup.

---

## 1. Compiler Compatibility Problems

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler. Using older versions may cause build failures or runtime issues.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Compilation errors mentioning unsupported language features
- `MOCK_METHOD` macro failing to parse
- Linker errors related to missing symbols or incompatible C++ runtimes

**Resolution Steps:**
- Verify your compiler version:

  ```bash
  gcc --version  # or
  clang --version
  ```

- Confirm it supports at least C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+).
- Ensure your build tools (like CMake) are at a supported minimum version (CMake 3.14+ recommended).

<Tip>
Always use a recent compiler and build environment to avoid subtle incompatibilities — older compilers often lack full C++17 feature support required by GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
</Tip>

## 2. Incorrect Include and Link Paths

A frequent setup mistake is not correctly pointing your project to GoogleTest headers or libraries.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Compile errors like `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory`
- Linker failures for symbols such as `testing::Test::Test()`

**Resolution Steps:**
- Confirm that your project includes the path where the `gtest` headers reside, either in your CMake project or your build system.
- When linking, include the GoogleTest libraries, typically `gtest` and `gtest_main`.

**Example CMake snippet:**

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(my_test test_main.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_test ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)
```

- If using `FetchContent` mode in CMake, ensure the dependency is properly fetched and linked (see [Installation via CMake](../setup-and-installation/installation-via-cmake) for detailed instructions).

<Warning>
Link errors might also occur if your build mixes incompatible runtimes or linking static vs shared libraries inconsistently.
</Warning>

## 3. Incompatible or Missing Build Tools

GoogleTest expects specific versions of CMake, Bazel, or other build tools depending on your setup approach.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Failure during the build process reporting missing CMake commands
- Bazel build errors regarding unknown directives or workspace configuration

**Resolution Steps:**
- Verify your version of CMake with `cmake --version`. Upgrade to 3.14 or newer.
- For Bazel, use a supported Bazel version as per GoogleTest compatibility notes.
- Ensure all necessary build dependencies (e.g., `make`, `ninja`) are installed.

<Tip>
Using package managers or recent OS distributions usually provides compatible build tool versions out of the box.
</Tip>

## 4. Runtime Errors Due to Missing Virtual Destructors

If the interface classes you mock lack virtual destructors, GoogleMock may cause heap corruption or test failures.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Heap checker errors
- Unexpected behavior or crashes during test teardown

**Resolution Steps:**
- Ensure that all base interfaces you mock have virtual destructors.

```cpp
class Interface {
 public:
  virtual ~Interface() {}  // Must be virtual!
  virtual void DoSomething() = 0;
};
```

- Without this, deleting mock objects via base class pointers can fail.

<Warning>
Missing virtual destructors can cause silent memory leaks or undefined behavior.
</Warning>

## 5. Confusion Between Expectation Types

Understanding the difference between *uninteresting* calls (no expectation set) and *unexpected* calls (argument mismatch with expectations) can prevent common test errors.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Warnings like “Uninteresting mock function call encountered”
- Failures about unexpected calls or argument mismatches

**Resolution Steps:**
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` for functions you want to verify are called with specific arguments.
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior without expectation.
- To suppress warnings on uninteresting calls without failing tests, use `NiceMock`:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
```

- To treat uninteresting calls as errors, use `StrictMock`.

<Check>
Refer to [Using Mocks in Tests](../reference/mocking.md#UsingMocks) and [The Nice, the Strict, and the Naggy](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md#NiceStrictNaggy) for deeper understanding.
</Check>

## 6. Common Linker and Symbol Resolution Issues

If your tests compile but fail at linking, it’s usually because GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries are not linked.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Linker errors for symbols starting with `testing::`

**Resolution Steps:**
- Add `-lgtest -lgtest_main` or corresponding link targets in your build files.
- Add any necessary threading libraries (`-pthread` for pthread-based systems).

## 7. Troubleshooting Build From Source

When building GoogleTest manually from the source directory:

- Ensure you have cloned the repository correctly:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  cd googletest
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```

- If CMake configuration fails, check the C++ standard flag is set properly (C++17 minimum).

<Info>
Refer to [Building from Source](../setup-and-installation/building-from-source) for complete build instructions.
</Info>

## 8. Verifying Setup with the Built-in Tests

After installation, verify your setup by building and running the GoogleTest example or your minimal test bin:

```bash
./path/to/your/test_binary --gtest_list_tests
./path/to/your/test_binary
```

- Analyze test output for errors.
- If the examples fail to run, verify that runtime libraries and environment variables are properly configured.

## 9. Adjusting GoogleMock Verbosity for Diagnostic Output

When debugging failing mock expectations, increase the verbosity:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

- This will print detailed mock invocation traces and expectation matching info for easier diagnosis.

<Note>
Use caution: verbose output can be overwhelming; reduce verbosity once issues are resolved.
</Note>

## 10. Additional Helpful Practices

- Use IDE or build system integration for better debugging (e.g., Emacs `M-x google-compile`).
- Keep your mocks and expectations as simple and focused as possible.
- Avoid overly strict or too lenient expectations to minimize flaky tests.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if your mock may outlive the test scope to force verification.
