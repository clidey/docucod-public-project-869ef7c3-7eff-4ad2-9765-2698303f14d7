# Validating Your Setup

This guide helps you confirm that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation and configuration are correctly set up by running a sample or included test suite. It walks you through executing your first test program, understanding the outputs, and provides practical debugging advice if you encounter failures.

---

## 1. Overview

After installing GoogleTest and GoogleMock, the most important next step is to verify your environment is properly configured and your build system can compile and run tests successfully. This validation ensures your testing framework is ready to support your project reliably.

GoogleTest includes a set of example tests as well as the `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` function which runs all registered tests from your test binaries.

---

## 2. Running the Sample Test Suite

GoogleTest and GoogleMock packages provide test executables that include sample tests you can run directly after build.

### Step 1: Locate or Build the Test Executable
- If you built GoogleTest and GoogleMock from source using CMake, the test binaries are usually in your build directory (e.g., `build/googlemock/gtest/gtest_main` or `build/googlemock/gtest/gtest`).

- If you embedded GoogleTest into your project, build your test binary which should link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`. These libraries provide a `main()` function that calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Step 2: Execute the Test Binary
Run your test executable from a terminal or command prompt:

```bash
./your_test_executable
```

Example expected output snippet:

```
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 15 tests from 3 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 5 tests from SampleTestSuite
[ RUN      ] SampleTestSuite.TestOne
[       OK ] SampleTestSuite.TestOne (0 ms)
...
[  PASSED  ] 15 tests.
```

This output confirms your test framework runs and discovers tests correctly.

### Step 3: Interpretation of Test Results
- **[  PASSED  ]** indicates successful test runs.
- **[  FAILED  ]** indicates failed tests, with failure details following.
- The final exit code of the test executable reflects test success (0) or failure (non-zero).

## 3. Writing and Running Your First Custom Test

To further validate your setup and build confidence, write a simple test following these steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Test Source File (e.g., `sample_test.cc`)

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A basic test example
TEST(ValidatingSetup, SimpleCheck) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

### Step 2: Compile the Test
If you use CMake, add your test source and link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`:

```cmake
add_executable(sample_test sample_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(sample_test gtest_main)
add_test(NAME sample_test COMMAND sample_test)
```

Build your test:

```bash
cmake --build .
ctest -V
```

### Step 3: Run the Test
Simply run the `sample_test` executable. Successful run output will be similar to:

```
[ RUN      ] ValidatingSetup.SimpleCheck
[       OK ] ValidatingSetup.SimpleCheck (0 ms)
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms you can write and run your own tests successfully.

## 4. Understanding Key Output Messages

- **Running main() from gmock_main.cc:** Indicates the default main() function from GoogleMock has started executing. This function initializes GoogleMock and GoogleTest and calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- **[==========] Running X tests from Y test suites:** Shows total tests discovered and organized.

- **[ RUN      ] TestSuiteName.TestName:** Marks the start of an individual test.

- **[       OK ] TestSuiteName.TestName:** Marks successful test completion.

- **[  FAILED  ] TestSuiteName.TestName:** Marks test failure, followed by detailed failure messages.

- **Summary lines:** The total count of tests passed and failed.

- **Exit code:** A `0` exit signals all tests passed; non-zero signals some failures.

## 5. First Steps for Debugging Failures

If your tests fail or your test binary does not run correctly, follow these troubleshooting steps:

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Symptom                             | Cause / Fix                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test executable fails to run       | Confirm dependencies and runtime libraries are correctly linked.                      |
| No tests discovered or run         | Make sure test source files are compiled and linked against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`.
|
| Linking errors for GoogleTest libs | Verify correct library paths and compilation flags. Also check CMake install prefixes. |
| Program crashes during tests       | Use debugger or run tests individually to isolate failing tests.                      |
| Unexpected test failures           | Rebuild with debug symbols, check test source correctness, and ensure environment consistency. |

### Debugging Strategies
- Run tests with verbose output by passing `--gtest_verbose=info` to get additional diagnostic information:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_verbose=info
```

- Run a single test by name to isolate failures:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
```

- Confirm your main function calls `InitGoogleMock()` or `InitGoogleTest()` correctly before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. You can rely on linking `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to avoid manual `main()` implementation.

- Inspect compiler and linker command lines for correct flags and library paths.

- Verify C++17 or higher compiler support and thread library flags (`-pthread` on POSIX) are included.

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries** to avoid writing your own `main()` unless you need custom initialization.
- Always check the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in custom `main()` functions to ensure proper test run reporting.
- Group related tests logically into test suites to make results easy to interpret.
- Use test filters to run specific tests during development.
- Run tests via your build system's test runner (e.g., `ctest` with CMake) to integrate with CI pipelines.

## Appendix: Sample `main()` From gmock_main.cc

If you create your own main function, it should look like this minimal example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This initializes the framework and runs all tests, returning the proper exit status.

Check your setup now by building and running sample tests. Successful runs mean your GoogleTest environment is ready for your project's testing needs.

<Tip>
If you encounter issues, verify your build flags, linked libraries, and environment variables before seeking external help.
