# Introduction & Prerequisites

Welcome to the GoogleTest and GoogleMock frameworks. This section provides a concise overview of these tools, clarifies their roles, targets intended users, and outlines the necessary system and compiler requirements for a successful installation and configuration.

---

## What are GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

- **GoogleTest (gTest)** is Google's widely used C++ testing framework for writing unit and integration tests.
- **GoogleMock (gMock)** is the accompanying mocking framework designed for creating mock classes that facilitate testing interactions and dependencies in C++ code.

Together, they empower developers to write maintainable, reliable, and expressive tests, while enabling fine-grained control over dependencies and behavior verification.

---

## Who Should Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

- **C++ Developers and Testers** seeking robust frameworks to automate and isolate testing.
- **QA Engineers** needing repeatable and scalable testing solutions.
- **Technical Leads and Architects** looking to establish high-quality testing standards and dependency isolation through mocks.

These frameworks support a variety of use cases including unit testing, integration testing, API contract verification, and prototyping via mocks.

## Supported Platforms and System Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support most modern platforms and compilers:

- **Operating Systems:**
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows
  - Embedded and cross-compiled systems

- **Compilers:**
  - GCC (modern versions)
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++
  - Others supporting C++11 and above

- **C++ Standard:**
  - Requires **C++11** or newer for full feature support.

- **Dependencies:**
  - GoogleTest and GoogleMock come bundled together.
  - Requires standard C++ library support.
  - No additional external dependencies are needed out of the box.

- **Build Tools:**
  - Compatible with popular build systems like CMake and Bazel.

## Compiler and Build Environment Notes

- Ensure your compiler supports at least C++11. Features like lambdas and smart pointers are extensively used.
- On Windows, be aware of specific calling conventions; GoogleMock supports these via options.
- For large mock classes, consider separating constructor and destructor definitions into `.cc` files to improve compilation speed.

## Getting Ready

To prepare for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

1. Verify your system meets the OS and compiler requirements.
2. Install or clone the GoogleTest repository, which includes GoogleMock.
3. Configure your build system to compile and link against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
4. Familiarize yourself with the basics of writing mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.

## Practical Tips

- **C++ Version:** Always build your projects with at least C++11 enabled to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Mock Placement:** Place mock class definitions close to the interfaces they mock, preferably alongside production code in test-only directories.
- **Use Namespaces:** Import relevant `testing` namespace symbols once per file for clear and concise code.
- **Keep Mocks Public:** Always declare `MOCK_METHOD` macros in the public section of your mock classes to facilitate expectation setting.
