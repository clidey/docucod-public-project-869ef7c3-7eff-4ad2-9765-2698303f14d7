# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

This document details the essential compiler and language requirements for using GoogleTest, lists supported build systems and operating systems, and guides you to confirm your environment is ready before proceeding with installation.

---

## 1. Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **C++17** or later. This is a strict requirement as many of the framework’s features rely on modern C++ language capabilities.

### How to Verify Your Compiler Supports C++17

1. Check your compiler version and documentation to confirm C++17 support.
2. Ensure your build system sets the appropriate compiler flags to enable C++17, for example:

```bash
# GCC or Clang
-std=c++17

# MSVC
/std:c++17
```

### Notes:
- If your project is predominantly C, you may need to explicitly add these flags for compiling GoogleTest.
- GoogleTest enforces this at compile time; attempts to build with earlier standards will fail.

## 2. Supported Build Systems

GoogleTest is designed to integrate well with common C++ build systems. These include:

- **CMake:** The primary and most supported build system for GoogleTest.
  - Minimum CMake version: **3.13** (some features require CMake 3.14 or higher)
  - Supports generating native makefiles, Visual Studio projects, and Xcode projects.

- Other build tools can be used, but require manual configuration to point to GoogleTest headers and libraries.

### Recommended Build System Practice

- Use **CMake** to simplify the integration and build process.
- Use `FetchContent` or `add_subdirectory()` to manage GoogleTest sources in your project.
- Set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 or higher explicitly to ensure compatibility.

## 3. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports cross-platform development on various operating systems:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions and MinGW)
- **macOS**
- Supported platforms align with [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), for a comprehensive list please see the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Platform Capabilities

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms with pthreads (e.g., Linux, macOS).
- On Windows, GoogleTest uses native threading primitives; some platform-specific synchronization details may vary but the framework works reliably.
- Use provided macros to detect platform features (e.g., `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`).

## 4. Threading and Runtime Considerations

- To enable threading support, ensure the pthread library is available and linked correctly on POSIX systems.
- CMake scripts provided handle this detection automatically and link against pthreads where appropriate.
- If pthread detection fails, manually define the `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro (1 to enable, 0 to disable).

## 5. Verifying Your Environment

Before installation and usage, confirm the following:

- Your compiler supports and is configured to use **C++17**.
- Your build tools (CMake or alternatives) are updated to supported versions.
- Your operating system is one of the supported platforms.
- On POSIX systems, pthreads support is enabled (or you have defined disabling macros).

### Quick Check Example with CMake:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17
```

### Compiler Flag Check:

```bash
g++ --version
clang++ --version
cl.exe  # on Windows
```

### Environment Variables:

Ensure no conflicting macros are disabling required features, especially for threading and C++ standard version.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Prerequisite Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="C++ Version Not Supported">
If your compiler fails with errors indicating unsupported language features, verify
- The compiler version supports C++17 fully.
- You have set the correct C++ standard flags (`-std=c++17` or equivalent).
- Your build system does not override these flags inadvertently.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="pthreads Missing or Not Linked">
On POSIX systems, errors related to pthread functions indicate missing or incorrect linking:
- Ensure your system has pthread development packages installed.
- Let CMake find pthread via `find_package(Threads)` or manually link `-lpthread`.
- Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if autodetection fails.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Operating System">
GoogleTest relies on commonly used OS features; if running on exotic or embedded OSes:
- Check if GoogleTest supports your platform.
- Consider custom porting or disabling certain GoogleTest features.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Summary

To prepare for building and integrating GoogleTest:

1. Use a modern C++17-compatible compiler and set flags accordingly.
2. Prefer CMake 3.13 or newer, ideally 3.14+, as your build system.
3. Confirm your platform supports pthreads or native threading as needed.
4. Review official platform support links to verify your environment.

Ensuring these prerequisites will guarantee a smooth build and integration experience with GoogleTest.
