## Breaking Changes

While striving for backward compatibility, some releases introduce breaking changes requiring migration:

- **Minimum C++17 Requirement:** Starting with 1.17.0, GoogleTest no longer supports pre-C++17 compilers.
- **API Adjustments:** Occasional refinements to mock strictness wrappers and macro usage enhance clarity but may need code updates.

## Deprecation Notices

Features subject to deprecation are documented explicitly ahead of removal:

- Legacy macros and deprecated mocking behaviors will be phased out over subsequent releases.
- Users should adopt recommended replacement APIs from the Mocking Reference.

Early adoption of new APIs prevents future compatibility issues.
