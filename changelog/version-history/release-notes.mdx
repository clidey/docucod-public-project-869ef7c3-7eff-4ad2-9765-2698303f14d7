## Recent Releases

### Version 1.17.0 (Released: March 2023)
- **C++17 Baseline:** Minimum requirement updated to C++17 standard. Users must ensure their build environments support C++17 to use this release.
- **Enhancements:** Improvements to both GoogleTest and GoogleMock components, including better test discovery, refined assertion macros, and enhanced mocking capabilities.
- **Documentation Updates:** The documentation was migrated to GitHub Pages for improved accessibility and navigation.
- **Deprecations:** Minimal; users upgrading from earlier C++ standards need to migrate build systems accordingly.

For detailed release notes, see the [GitHub v1.17.0 Release page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0).

## Key Features and Improvements by Version

### Version 1.16.x Series
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock were merged into a single repository for simplified maintenance and deployment.
- Added extended matchers and customizable mock actions to provide richer test verification.
- Strengthened test suite and fixture APIs to improve scalability for large codebases.

### Earlier 1.15.x Series
- Enhanced death test reliability and reporting.
- Introduced better integration with CMake and Bazel build systems.
- Added support for user-defined predicates and matchers for more expressive assertions.

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes

- **C++ Standard Upgrade:** Starting from version 1.17.x, C++17 is mandatory. This change may impact projects still targeting older C++ standards. Updating your compiler settings and build configurations is necessary.
- **Build System Adjustments:** The merge of GoogleMock and GoogleTest repositories means users should update their build integration references. For projects using CMake, ensure you follow updated guidelines for adding GoogleTest and GoogleMock as dependencies.

<Check>
If you are upgrading from a pre-1.17.x release, verify your compiler supports C++17 and adjust build flags accordingly.
