## Latest Release: GoogleTest 1.17.0 (June 2023)

### Executive Summary
The 1.17.0 release marks a significant milestone by requiring C++17, enabling modern language features and improving overall robustness. It includes updated documentation hosting, multiple build system enhancements, and critical fixes that improve cross-platform testing stability.

### Key Highlights
- **C++17 Minimum Requirement:** Ensures compatibility with modern C++ environments and improves language feature usage across GoogleTest.
- **Documentation Migration:** Official documentation is now hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/), providing a smoother browsing experience.
- **Continuous Integration:** Google's internal CI systems maintain high test suite quality and reliability.
- **Planned Dependencies:** Preparation for a future dependency on [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp), which will help improve internal tooling and code reuse.

### Critical Bug Fixes and Improvements
- Streamlined build with CMake and better control over multi-threading and threading flags.
- Enhanced compatibility with Visual Studio runtimes to prevent common linking errors.
- More robust handling of shared versus static runtimes on Windows environments to eliminate CRT conflicts.

### How to Upgrade
To migrate to version 1.17.0:
- Ensure your toolchain supports C++17 or later.
- Review your build configurations for compatibility with the new runtime and threading flags.
- Update your dependencies and CI pipelines to use the new documentation URLs and test suites.
