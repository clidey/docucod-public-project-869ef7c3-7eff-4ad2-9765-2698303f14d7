## Best Practices for Upgrading

- Before upgrading to a new major or minor version, carefully review the breaking changes and deprecations sections.
- Leverage the [Breaking Changes & Migration Steps](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/upgrade-migration/breaking-changes) guide for detailed instructions.
- Use semantic versioning as a guide to the level of changes expected: major versions indicate potential compatibility breaks; minor versions add features without breaking APIs; patches address bug fixes.

---

## Troubleshooting and Auditing

When diagnosing issues with tests or test builds:

- Consult the changelog entry corresponding to your current or target version to identify relevant fixes or changes.
- Cross-reference with the [Bug Fixes & Patches](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/feature-fixes/bug-fixes) page for specific problem resolutions.
- Review security updates if your environment requires compliance or vulnerability management.
