## Best Practices When Upgrading

- **Review breaking changes closely:** Some versions introduce API changes that require code adjustments.
- **Confirm toolchain compatibility:** New releases often raise the minimum required C++ standard or compiler version.
- **Test in isolation:** Before full integration, run the tests on the new release alone to pinpoint issues.
- **Leverage new features gradually:** Utilize improvements such as enhanced assertions and parameterized test capabilities to improve code quality incrementally.

## Example: How to Use Past Release Notes

Suppose you are currently using version 1.14.0 and want to upgrade to 1.17.0. Reviewing past releases, you may identify:

- API deprecations in versions 1.15.0 and 1.16.0.
- Key bug fixes in 1.16.0 related to threading.
- New assertion macros introduced in 1.17.0.

This insight guides your upgrade approach by first addressing API changes and then incorporating new features after full regression testing.
