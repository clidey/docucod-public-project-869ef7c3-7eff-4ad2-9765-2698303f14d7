## Overview of the Latest Release

GoogleTest continues to evolve as the premier C++ testing framework from Google, embracing modern C++ standards and delivering robust testing capabilities. The most recent release centers on aligning with contemporary C++ development practices by requiring a minimum of C++17, enhancing integration and future extensibility.

### Key Highlights

- **Minimum C++17 Requirement:**
  The latest branch (`1.17.x`) mandates usage of C++17 or later. This change ensures users benefit from the latest language features and optimizations, future-proofing their test suites.

- **Documentation Accessibility:**
  GoogleTest’s documentation is now fully hosted on GitHub Pages (https://google.github.io/googletest/). This approach offers users an improved browsing experience, easy navigation, and ready access to user guides and API references.

- **Project Consolidation:**
  The release consolidates the previously separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects. Users now enjoy unified maintenance and synchronized releases, simplifying version management.

- **Upcoming Dependencies:**
  Plans are underway to introduce a dependency on Abseil, Google's collection of C++ libraries, which will add more utility and modern features to GoogleTest in future versions.

## Understanding What Changed

This page focuses exclusively on the latest release notes, detailing what users need to know to effectively upgrade and leverage new capabilities.

### Minimum C++ Standard Update

The elevation of the required C++ standard to C++17 means:

- Your build environment must support C++17 or newer.
- Legacy codebases targeting earlier standards might need updates to compile.
- You gain immmediate access to features like structured bindings, `std::optional`, improved constexpr, and more, allowing for more expressive test code.

### Documentation and User Resources

GoogleTest’s documentation migration to GitHub Pages brings:

- Easy access to the comprehensive [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
- Streamlined browsing compared to raw repository files.
- Centralized location for the Primer, Reference, and advanced user workflows.

If you haven’t explored the online docs yet, now is a good opportunity to familiarize yourself with best practices and detailed usage scenarios.

### Unified Testing and Mocking Framework

By merging GoogleTest and GoogleMock,

- You’ll maintain and distribute both in tandem, mitigating version mismatches and compatibility issues.
- Test discovery and running frameworks are integrated seamlessly with mocking capabilities.

This unification empowers you to employ mock objects in C++ tests without juggling separate toolchains.

## How to Upgrade and Get Started with the Latest Version

### Steps to Adopt the 1.17.x Branch

1. **Check your Compiler:** Confirm your toolchain supports C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+).
2. **Update Build Configuration:** Modify your build system to enable C++17 (e.g., `-std=c++17` in GCC/Clang).
3. **Fetch the Latest Code:** Pull the 1.17.0 release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0).
4. **Rebuild Your Tests:** Recompile your test binaries with the updated GoogleTest libraries.
5. **Review Documentation:** Visit the online [GoogleTest User Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for updated guidance and examples.

<Tip>
Upgrading your C++ standard might expose deprecated code or require refactoring your tests. Use the migration time to clean up and modernize your test suites for long-term benefits.
