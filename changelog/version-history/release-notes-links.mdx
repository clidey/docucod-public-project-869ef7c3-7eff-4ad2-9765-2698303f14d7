## Best Practices for Using Release Notes

### Stay Informed
Regularly review new releases and scan for updates that may benefit your projects.

### Verify Compatibility
Before upgrading, ensure your toolchain and platform support the new version, especially as the 1.17.x branch requires at least C++17.

### Backup and Test
Always back up your test code and run thorough test suites after upgrading to catch integration issues early.

### Use Release Notes for Migration
If breaking changes or deprecated features are mentioned, follow the linked migration guides or official documentation updates.
