## Troubleshooting and Tips

- Ensure your compiler supports the minimum required C++ standard to avoid compilation errors.
- When upgrading between major versions, run your entire test suite to detect any failing tests due to API changes.
- Use the built-in test discovery to reduce maintenance overhead; no need to enumerate tests manually.
- Take advantage of `ASSERT_*` versus `EXPECT_*` macros to control test flow on failures.

## Example: Checking Your Version and Upgrading

```bash
# Check your current GoogleTest version
$ gtest-config --version
1.16.0

# Review the changelog for any incompatible changes since 1.16.0
# Follow the migration guide if upgrading to 1.17.0 or later
```
