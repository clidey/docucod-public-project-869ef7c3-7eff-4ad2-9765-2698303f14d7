# Latest Release Highlights

This page summarizes the most recent updates to GoogleTest and GoogleMock, highlighting the key enhancements, headline features, important deprecations, and upgrade recommendations. Designed to keep you informed on what has changed and why it matters, this changelog helps you quickly understand how the latest release improves your testing experience.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The latest release introduces critical improvements aimed at modernizing the framework, enhancing usability, and ensuring robust compatibility with current C++ standards. Emphasizing stability and performance, these updates deliver new capabilities while providing clear guidance on deprecated features and migration steps.

---

## 2. Key New Features and Improvements

### 2.1 C++17 Minimum Requirement
- The release now requires **at least C++17** compliance for all builds.
- This upgrade unlocks language modernizations, improves compiler optimizations, and positions GoogleTest and GoogleMock for future enhancements.

### 2.2 Improved Mocking Capabilities
- Continued refinement of **mock object syntax and behavior** ensuring more intuitive and expressive mock definitions.
- Enhanced support for **partial mocks** and flexible matchers to cover complex testing scenarios.

### 2.3 Package Config Files Update
- The `.pc.in` template files for CMake (`gtest.pc.in`, `gmock.pc.in`, etc.) now reflect the latest installation variables and dependency linkage, ensuring smoother integration with build systems.

### 2.4 Documentation Consolidation
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock documentation have been consolidated and relocated to a top-level `docs` directory.
- Users are encouraged to visit the new centralized documentation site: [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/)

### 2.5 Ecosystem Advancements
- Increased alignment with external projects, notably through planned dependency on **Abseil**, modernizing internal utilities and compatibility.
- Enhanced integration with popular CI systems and build tools for streamlined test automation.

## 3. Deprecations and Breaking Changes

### 3.1 C++ Standard Requirement Enforcement
- Users must now ensure their projects **compile with C++17 or newer**.
- Older C++ standards (C++11, C++14) are no longer supported and will cause build failures.

### 3.2 Removed Legacy Documentation Paths
- Previous documentation paths like `googlemock/docs/README.md` or similar in subdirectories are deprecated; all docs reside at the top-level `docs`.

### 3.3 Build System Configurations
- Package config templates expect updated variable placeholders and may break backward compatibility if custom modifications are based on old configurations.

---

## 4. Upgrade and Migration Recommendations

### 4.1 Prepare Your Build Environment
- Upgrade your compiler to support at least **C++17**.
- Update your build scripts (e.g., CMakeLists.txt) to include the latest `.pc` files for `gtest`, `gmock`, and main variants.

### 4.2 Update Documentation References
- Redirect all documentation lookups to the centralized site at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
- Remove references to now-deprecated internal README files.

### 4.3 Review Mock Definitions and Usage
- Consult the latest mock API usage guides, especially if you leverage advanced mocking patterns.
- Test and adjust mock strictness levels and call expectations in light of improvements to mock behavior handling.

---

## 5. Practical Tips for Transition

- **Verify your test builds** post-upgrade with sample tests before integrating into CI workflows.
- Use the comprehensive [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) to revisit recommended test structure and best practices.
- Monitor runtime logs for unexpected mock call warnings; adjust mock strictness or expectations accordingly.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Upgrade Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Failures Related to C++ Standard">
If your build fails due to unsupported C++ standards, confirm your compiler version and build flags enforce at least C++17. For CMake, set:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Deprecated Documentation References">
If tooling or local scripts reference outdated documentation files, update links to point to the official [GoogleTest documentation site](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linking Errors Related to .pc Files">
Ensure you are linking against the correct `.pc` files generated for your version of GoogleTest/GoogleMock. Confirm that environment variables such as `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` include the directory containing the latest `.pc` files.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
