## Versioning and Release Strategy

GoogleTest follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) principles, with the version numbers formatted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, representing:

- **MAJOR**: Large, potentially backward-incompatible changes
- **MINOR**: New features and non-breaking improvements
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and small internal changes

Releases include:

- **Major Releases**: Significant changes impacting API or behavior
- **Minor Releases**: Feature additions, enhancements
- **Patch Releases**: Bug fixes, security updates
- **Pre-release Versions**: Alphas, betas, or release candidates for testing purposes

#### Branches

- Stable release branches maintain backward compatibility within major versions.
- Development continues on the `main` branch, with pre-releases generated as needed.

## Identifying Your Version

To determine the GoogleTest version your project uses:

- Check header files (e.g., `gtest/gtest.h`) or library version macros.
- Review your dependency management configuration (e.g., CMakeLists, Bazel WORKSPACE).
- Inspect release tags if you cloned the repository directly.

Keeping your framework updated ensures access to the latest features and security fixes.
