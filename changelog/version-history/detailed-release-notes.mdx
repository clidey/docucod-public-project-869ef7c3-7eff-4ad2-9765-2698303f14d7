## 5. Sample Entry from Release Notes (Example)

### Version 1.17.0 - Released 2021-03-04

**Executive Summary:**
- Required minimum C++17 standard.
- Added richer verbosity control via `--gmock_verbose` flag.
- Enhanced usage of `InitGoogleMock()` to process command-line flags efficiently.

**New Features:**

- New matchers for container checking.

**Improvements:**
- More accurate failure messages in output tests.
- Refined strictness controls for mocks (`StrictMock`, `NaggyMock`, `NiceMock`).

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed parsing logic for multiple GoogleMock command-line flags.
- Resolved leaks in test fixtures triggering false-positive leaks.

**Deprecations:**
- Deprecated some legacy macros, favoring modern testing constructs.

**Breaking Changes:**

## 6. Release Notes in Your Workflow

### Initializing and Running Tests with Updates

When upgrading, use the `InitGoogleMock` function as shown below to capture flag changes introduced in recent releases:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This ensures your tests honor flags like `--gmock_verbose` and handle new behavior adjustments seamlessly.

### Handling New Verbosity Levels

You can control the verbosity of GoogleMock's output to aid debugging:

- `info` — prints all messages.
- `warning` — prints warnings and errors (default).
- `error` — prints errors only.

Set via command line or programmatically:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

or in code:

```cpp
GMOCK_FLAG_SET(verbose, "info");
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues Referenced in Release Notes

- **Flag Parsing Failures:** Check for proper syntax `--gmock_flag=value`.
- **Leaked Mocks:** Enable `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks` to help identify.
- **Unexpected Calls:** Review expectations configured with `EXPECT_CALL` and default actions.
- **Compiler Errors:** Confirm your environment meets the minimum supported C++ standard and dependencies.
