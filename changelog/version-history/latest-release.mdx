## Version 1.17.0 – Released

### Executive Summary
The 1.17.0 release marks a significant milestone for GoogleTest, building on its robust C++ testing foundation. This version introduces critical updates focused on modern C++ standards compliance, enhanced test framework capabilities, and improved build system integration.

### Key Updates and Enhancements

- **C++17 Minimum Requirement**: The 1.17.x branch requires a minimum of C++17 standard support. This aligns GoogleTest with modern C++ features and enhances compatibility and performance. Users must ensure their build environments support C++17 to benefit from the latest features.

- **Unified Repository with GoogleMock**: The ongoing merger of GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects continues, offering a seamless testing and mocking experience within a single repository. This provides smoother development flows and simplifies dependency management.

- **Updated Build and Integration Workflow**: Enhancements in the CMake build scripts and supporting files make integrating GoogleTest into larger projects more streamlined. Notably, the updated `CMakeLists.txt` supports flexible toggling of GoogleMock inclusion and better compatibility with various platforms.

- **Continued Cross-Platform Support**: GoogleTest maintains and improves its extensive platform support, covering compilers and OS environments as specified in the Google foundational C++ support policy.

- **Ongoing Documentation Enhancements**: Full documentation is now hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/), providing an improved browsing and search experience.

### Benefits to Users

- Modern C++ compliance ensures that your test suites can leverage newer language features while maintaining stable build environments.
- Integrated GoogleMock support simplifies writing comprehensive tests involving mocks and stubs.
- Enhanced build flexibility supports diverse development setups and continuous integration pipelines.
- Robust documentation aids both new and advanced users in quickly adopting improved practices.

### Upgrade and Migration Notes

- **C++ Standard Enforcement**: Upgrade your compiler and build toolchains to C++17 or newer if you have not done so.
- **Review Build Configurations**: Adjust CMake options as needed, especially regarding the `BUILD_GMOCK` flag if you want to build GoogleMock alongside GoogleTest.
- **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for comprehensive details on new features and configuration.

### Resolved Issues and Fixes

- Stability improvements across multithreaded test executions.
- Fixes in test discovery and filtering mechanisms.
- MacOS, Windows, and Linux platform-specific build fixes and runtime tweaks.

### Additional Notes

- Google continues to use its internal continuous integration systems to maintain the quality of releases.
- A future dependency on Abseil is planned to further modernize GoogleTest's internals and dependencies.

## How to Upgrade

1. **Clone the v1.17.0 Branch:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
```

2. **Build Using CMake:**

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

If you want to disable GoogleMock during the build:

```sh
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

3. **Update Your C++ Standard to C++17:**
Update your project’s compiler flags accordingly (e.g., `-std=c++17`).

4. **Run Your Tests:**
Ensure your test binaries link against the updated GoogleTest libraries and execute normally.

## Troubleshooting Common Upgrade Issues

<Tip>
If you encounter linker errors related to runtime libraries on Windows, consider enabling the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align dynamic runtime linkage.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Building with a compiler that does not support C++17 will fail. Verify your toolchain compatibility before attempting the upgrade.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If test discovery fails, ensure your test registration macros are correctly used and that your test sources are recompiled against the new library.
