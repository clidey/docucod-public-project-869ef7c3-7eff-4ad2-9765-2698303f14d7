## Release Highlights

### Version 1.17.0 â€” Released on [Release Date](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

The GoogleTest 1.17.0 release brings important platform updates and modern C++ standard requirements, empowering you to leverage new language features and improve test reliability.

#### Key Updates:

- **Minimum C++17 Requirement**: This release requires your environment to support at least the C++17 standard. This change ensures compatibility with modern C++ features, improved language safety, and future-proofing your test code.

- **Documentation Live on GitHub Pages**: GoogleTest documentation is now hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/). This provides a streamlined, searchable, and continuously updated resource to enhance your learning and troubleshooting experience.

- **Improved Continuous Integration (CI) Practices**: The project uses Google's internal CI systems guaranteeing higher build stability and faster feedback loops.

- **Future Integrations Planned**: The team plans to integrate a dependency on [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp), which will bring additional utility support and code modernizations.


### What This Means for You

If you maintain or develop C++ test suites using GoogleTest, upgrading to 1.17.0 unlocks:

- Access to more robust language features that can improve test expressiveness and safety.
- Enhanced documentation that helps troubleshoot and learn with ease and confidence.
- A more stable and reliable build and test environment thanks to coordinated CI.


## Immediate Adoption Recommendations

### Verify C++17 Support in Your Build Environment

Ensure your compiler and build tooling support at least C++17. Update your build scripts accordingly, for example, by setting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 in CMake projects.

### Leverage the New Documentation Portal

Migrate your documentation references and workflows to the official GitHub Pages site for the latest guides, tutorials, and API references.

### Plan for Future Upgrades with Abseil

Monitor upcoming versions that introduce Abseil dependencies. Familiarize your team with Abseil's utilities to seamlessly integrate future GoogleTest enhancements.
