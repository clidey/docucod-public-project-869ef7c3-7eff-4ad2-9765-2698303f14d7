## 1. Executive Summary

Version 1.17.0 marks an important milestone for GoogleTest, continuing to improve reliability, modern C++ compatibility, and ease of integration. This release requires at least C++17 support, aligning with modern compiler standards and ensuring robust feature support. The update also sets the stage for future enhancements through a planned dependency on Abseil, introducing new possibilities in utility and consistency.

Key highlights of this release include:

- Full adoption of C++17 minimum standard, enabling modern language features and improved compiler interoperability.
- Continued seamless integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, maintaining a unified, powerful testing environment.
- Documentation migration to GitHub Pages for improved user accessibility and navigation.
- Various internal updates and fixes enhancing test discovery, assertion capabilities, and build system flexibility.

This release strengthens GoogleTest’s position as the premier framework for expressive, reliable C++ automated testing.


## 2. Release Highlights

### 2.1 C++17 Minimum Requirement
GoogleTest 1.17.x requires a compiler environment that supports at least the C++17 standard. This change:

- Enables leveraging modern language features for cleaner code and improved performance.
- Ensures better compatibility with contemporary build environments.
- May require updating your compiler or build scripts accordingly.


### 2.2 Documentation Enhancements
The GoogleTest documentation has been fully moved and updated on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/).

- This migration offers improved browsing, searchability, and accessibility.
- New users and seasoned developers alike will benefit from clearer guides and examples.
- Visit the User’s Guide page for a well-rounded introduction.


### 2.3 Integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock
This release continues the combined distribution of GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- Unifies development and user experience for mocking and unit testing.
- Supports automatic test discovery, rich assertions, and sophisticated mocking patterns.
- Provides compatibility with established build systems including CMake and Bazel.


### 2.4 Build and Installation Improvements
The release includes updates to build scripts and cmake configurations:

- Improved support for building GoogleTest as standalone or integrated into existing projects.
- Enhanced handling of dynamic vs. static runtimes on Visual Studio platforms.
- Friendly configuration options to toggle GoogleMock inclusion.


### 2.5 Upcoming Developments
Looking ahead, GoogleTest plans to introduce a dependency on Abseil (Abseil C++ common libraries), promising better utility functions and modernization.


## 3. Using This Release

### 3.1 Getting Started
To start using GoogleTest 1.17.0:

- Clone the repository or download the release archive tagged `v1.17.0`.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
  cd googletest
  ```

- Build using CMake (version 3.14 or newer):

  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install
  ```

- To build only GoogleTest without GoogleMock:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
  ```


### 3.2 Compiler Requirements
Ensure your compiler supports C++17. This can be configured in your build system, for example by setting:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Or by passing compiler flags:

```
-std=c++17
```


### 3.3 Runtime Library Options
When building on Visual Studio, consider the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option:

- Enforce dynamic or static linkage of the C runtime to match your project.
- Example:

```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```


### 3.4 Macro Naming Customization
To avoid clashes with other libraries defining GoogleTest macros, macros can be renamed by defining flags such as `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` at compile time.
