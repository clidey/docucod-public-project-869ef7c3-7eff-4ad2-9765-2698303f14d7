## Current Stable Release: Version 1.17.0

- **Release Date:** Refer to the official [GitHub release page for v1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0).
- **Documentation:** The complete and updated documentation is now hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/).

### Key Highlights of 1.17.0 Release

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock continue to be bundled and maintained together to ensure seamless integration and consistent feature support.
- The minimum required C++ standard has been raised to **C++17**, improving language feature support and platform compatibility. See the [C++17 requirement policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard) for details.
- Enhanced build support with CMake, including updated build configurations to better support multiple platforms and environments.
- Ongoing infrastructure improvements aimed at internal continuous integration and build reliability.
- Forward-looking notice: GoogleTest plans to adopt a dependency on [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) to leverage its core utilities, expected in future releases.

### Noteworthy Announcements

- The official documentation is no longer maintained in older repository folders but lives exclusively at the GitHub Pages site linked above. This shift provides a richer browsing experience and easier access to examples, guides, and API references.
- Continuous Integration is performed using Google’s internal systems, ensuring robust test coverage and release quality.

### Changes in User Experience and Build

- The enhanced CMake build system allows building GoogleTest and GoogleMock as standalone projects or integrating them into existing projects with consistent compiler and linker settings.
- Visual Studio users can resolve runtime library conflicts by enabling the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option.
- GoogleTest supports building as both static and shared libraries (DLLs), with guidance on appropriate compiler flags.
- Multi-threaded testing is now better supported by detecting and optionally forcing pthread usage for thread safety.
