## Understanding the Versioning Scheme

GoogleTest uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), expressed as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** version changes indicate backward-incompatible changes or major rewrites.
- **MINOR** version changes add new features or significant improvements, while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **PATCH** version changes include bug fixes and minor refinements that do not break existing functionality.

Each release is carefully documented in detail in the respective release notes linked alongside the version information.
