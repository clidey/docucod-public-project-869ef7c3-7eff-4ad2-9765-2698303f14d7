Each entry includes:

- **Version Number**: Semantic versioning is followed to clearly indicate majors, minors, and patches.
- **Release Date**: The date when the version was made publicly available.
- **Change Highlights**: Summaries of key features, improvements, fixes, or removals.
- **Breaking Changes**: Explicit notes on changes that require code or configuration adaptations.
- **Security Updates**: Notices on any security-related patches.

## Example Entries

### Version 1.16.0 - Released on 2023-09-15

- Improved multi-threading support for complex test cases.
- Added new matchers to gMock for better argument validation.
- Fixed race conditions in death tests.
- Deprecated older macros no longer aligned with modern C++17 standards.

### Version 1.15.0 - Released on 2022-12-10

- Enhanced test filtering to improve selective execution.
- Resolved a linking issue affecting certain platforms during static library usage.
- Updated documentation and added more code samples in the mocks API.

## Navigating Between Major, Minor, and Patch Releases

- **Major Releases** (e.g., 1.x.0) introduce new features and possibly breaking changes.
- **Minor Releases** (e.g., 1.15.x) typically include enhancements and important bug fixes.
- **Patch Releases** (e.g., 1.16.1) focus on security patches and critical bug fixes without new features.

Major version breaks are rare, indicating strong backward compatibility.

## Migration and Compatibility

For any breaking changes noted, users are advised to consult the corresponding migration notes documented separately in the [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](/changelog/upgrade-guidance/breaking-changes).

Use these notes to:

- Apply step-by-step guidance adjusting tests and build configurations.
- Understand deprecated features with timelines for removal.
- Evaluate compatibility matrices detailing supported compiler versions and platform constraints.

## Where to Find Detailed Release Notes

For a concise summary of recent changes or specific release details, visit the [Latest Release Notes](/changelog/version-history/latest-release-notes).

Comprehensive release notes exist as markdown files in the project repository documenting each version update with full technical details.

## Best Practices for Using Version History

- Always test your codebase locally when upgrading to a newer version.
- Review breaking changes before upgrading to anticipate and resolve issues early.
- Use the documented version history to correlate bug fixes to issues seen in your environment.
- Prefer supported stable releases for production testing environments.

## Troubleshooting and Support

If you encounter unexpected issues related to upgrades, use the [Common Installation Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues) and [General Usage FAQ](/faq/common-usage-issues/faq-general) to diagnose.

Community forums and GitHub issue tracking are also recommended for seeking help with version-specific questions.
