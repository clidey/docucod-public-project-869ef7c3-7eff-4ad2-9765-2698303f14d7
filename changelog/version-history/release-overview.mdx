## Latest Releases

### Version 1.14.0 - Released 2024-06-15

- **Enhanced Mocking API:** Introduced improved support for specifying call sequences with greater flexibility, including enhanced `EXPECT_CALL` modifiers for partial ordering and retirement behavior.
- **Performance Improvements:** Optimized test discovery and execution phases to reduce startup overhead, especially for large test suites.
- **Bug Fixes:** Resolved multiple concurrency issues in multi-threaded mock scenarios, improving stability during parallel test runs.
- **Documentation Updates:** Added detailed examples for using mock strictness wrappers (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, `NaggyMock`) and new advanced call sequencing patterns.

### Version 1.13.0 - Released 2023-12-05

- **New Features:** Added support for default actions on mock methods returning move-only types, enabling more flexible mocking scenarios.
- **Mock Behavior Enhancements:** Clarified the semantics of `.RetiresOnSaturation()` and the interaction with `.Times()` and `.WillOnce()`, providing more predictable expectation lifecycle.
- **Improved Integration:** Streamlined initialization flow when combining GoogleTest and GoogleMock runners, simplifying custom `main()` function usage.
- **Fixed Issues:** Addressed edge cases with expectation ordering and uninteresting calls, reducing false warnings.

## Notable Breaking Changes

- The older `TestCase` API for test suites is deprecated in favor of `TestSuite` to align with modern terminology and practices; migrating existing code is encouraged.
- Expectations now adhere strictly to invocation count policies such as `.RetiresOnSaturation()`, requiring review of test mocks using these features.

Comprehensive migration instructions are provided in the [Breaking Changes](../migration-upgrade/breaking-changes.md) guide.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Regularly Update:** Stay current with releases to leverage performance enhancements and fix subtle concurrency issues in mocks.
- **Use Strictness Wrappers:** Employ `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` to control uninteresting call handling and improve test robustness.
- **Careful Expectation Ordering:** Define more general expectations first and override with specific ones last to avoid unintended shadowing.
- **Leverage Default Actions:** Use `ON_CALL` to set default mock behaviors, reducing boilerplate in tests.
- **Review Deprecations:** Adopt modern terminology (`TestSuite` vs `TestCase`) early to ensure forward compatibility.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Unexpected Test Failures:** Often due to failure to set up `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising the mock; ensure expectations are declared ahead of calls.
- **Thread Safety Concerns:** When running tests in parallel, mocks must be used according to thread-safety guidelines detailed in the [Scalability and Performance](../../concepts/extensibility-performance/scalability-performance.md) documentation.
- **Likelihood of Upper Bound Violations:** Occurs when a mock is called more than the specified `.Times()`. Consider `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to handle multiple expected invocations cleanly.

Refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions](../../faq/getting-started-common-issues/mock-usage-questions.md) and [Advanced Mocking Patterns](../../guides/mocking-and-behavior-verification/advanced-mocking-patterns.md) for deeper guidance.
