## Understanding the Release Listings

This page presents a curated, complete listing of all official GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. Whether you're onboarding or maintaining existing tests, reviewing the release notes here helps you stay informed about new capabilities, bug fixes, and important changes that may require your attention.


### What You Will Find Here

- **Core Updates**: Descriptions of new features and enhancements that enhance your testing and mocking experience.
- **Bug Fixes**: Details on resolved issues, improving reliability and stability.
- **Capability Improvements**: Information about enhancements to existing functionalities.

Every release entry is crafted to give you *full visibility* into the project's evolutionary steps, helping you confidently adopt newer versions or troubleshoot issues related to changes.

## Navigating the Release Details

Each release entry is structured to communicate the following:

1. **Release Version and Date** - Clear version numbering (following semantic versioning principles) and timestamp.
2. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview capturing the essence of the update.
3. **New Features and Improvements** - Whatâ€™s new and how it benefits your testing workflows.
4. **Bug Fixes** - What issues were fixed and scenarios affected.
5. **Breaking Changes and Migration Notes** - If applicable, instructions on how to transition smoothly.
6. **Security Updates** - Information about patches related to security vulnerabilities.
7. **Deprecated Features** - Features or behaviors slated for removal in future versions to avoid.

This systematic approach lets you quickly assess whether an update affects your projects and guides your migration or adoption.

## Practical Tips

- **Stay Current with Minor Releases:** Although major releases introduce broad changes, minor and patch releases often contain critical fixes and enhancements.
- **Carefully Review Breaking Changes:** Always consult the breaking changes section before upgrading your asserts and mock definitions.
- **Use Upgrade Guides:** Refer to migration assistance documentation when moving across significant versions.
- **Leverage Community Documentation:** The [Community-Created Documentation](docs/community_created_documentation.md) section offers additional resources and insights.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Skipping release notes prior to upgrading may lead to unexpected test failures.
- Ignoring deprecation notices can cause your tests to break upon future updates.
- Overlooking default behavior changes in mock expectations may result in flaky or incorrect tests.

## Example Release Entry Format

```markdown
### Version 1.12.1 - 2023-03-15

#### Summary
- Fixed issues with mocking methods taking move-only types.
- Improved diagnostic messages when expectations are not met.

#### New Features
- Added support for setting default values for user-defined types via `DefaultValue<T>`.

#### Bug Fixes
- Resolved a crash when using `ON_CALL` with overloaded methods without explicit casting.

```

## Troubleshooting Release-Based Issues

If after upgrading you encounter unexpected errors:

- Verify that mock methods are correctly declared using `MOCK_METHOD` with the right qualifiers.
- Ensure your expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) match the call patterns, considering new matcher capabilities.
- Check for conflicts arising from obsolete or deprecated mocking APIs.
- Consult the [Mocking FAQ](docs/gmock_faq.md) and [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for guidance.
