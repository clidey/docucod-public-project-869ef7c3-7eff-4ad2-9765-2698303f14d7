# Notable Features & Improvements in GoogleTest

GoogleTest continues to evolve, embracing modern C++ features and improving the testing experience for developers. This page highlights key enhancements introduced in recent versions that directly impact how you write, organize, and run your tests. Discover new assertions, enhanced parameterized testing, improved mock behaviors, and usability tweaks designed to streamline your daily workflow.

---

## 1. Enhanced Test Discovery and Organization

### Smarter Test Naming and Filtering
- Improved recognition of test suite and test names to better support complex naming patterns.
- Upgraded filtering mechanism supports glob patterns and regular expressions with more predictable behavior.

### Parameterized Testing Extensions
- New features in parameterized tests allow combining multiple parameter sources.
- Better support for type-parameterized tests simplifies testing templates and generic code.
- Support for instantiating tests with user-defined parameter generators.

**Example:**

```cpp
// Using combined parameter sources
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    Combined,
    MyTest,
    ::testing::Combine(::testing::Values(1, 2, 3), ::testing::Values('a', 'b')));

// Type-parameterized test usage
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

// Run tests for different types like int, double, etc.
```

## 2. New and Extended Assertions

### Richer Assertion Macros
- New assertions like `EXPECT_THAT()` and corresponding matchers provide expressive ways to validate container contents, strings, and custom predicates.
- Enhanced failure messages give clearer insights into what went wrong, including better printing of expected and actual values.

### Assertions for Floating-Point Comparisons
- More robust ways to test floating point equality with tolerances and ULP-based comparisons.
- Support for floating-point near equality with `EXPECT_NEAR()` improvements.

**Usage Example:**

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(my_vector, ::testing::ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
EXPECT_NEAR(my_float, expected_float, 1e-5);
```

## 3. Mocking Framework Improvements (gMock Enhancements)

### Better Control of Mock Behavior Modes
- Improved clarity and usability of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` behavior modes.
- Warnings and errors on uninteresting calls can be finely tuned per mock.

### More Powerful Matchers and Actions
- Enhanced built-in matcher support, including logical combinations (`AllOf`, `AnyOf`, `Not`) and container-specific matchers.
- Expanded action capabilities include chaining actions (`DoAll`), delegating to real or fake objects, and invoking argument callbacks.

### Simplified Mock Class Definitions
- `MOCK_METHOD` macro refinements provide clearer syntax and better handling of complex method signatures.
- Support for mocking move-only types (like `std::unique_ptr`) with straightforward syntax.

### Improved Sequencing and Expectation Ordering
- Enhanced `InSequence` and `After` clauses for specifying partial and total call orders in tests.
- Expectations retire automatically when saturated or as sequences advance to reduce brittleness.

**Example:**

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoThis(_))
    .Times(3)
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(3));

{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Start());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, End());
}
```

## 4. Improved Performance and Compilation Speed

### Compilation Efficiency
- Recommendation to move mock class constructors and destructors to `.cc` files to reduce compile times.
- Reduced template bloat when using `MOCK_METHOD` in large classes.

### Test Execution Speed
- Guidance on controlling mock strictness and uninteresting call warnings to optimize test suite runtime.
- Encouragement of using `ON_CALL` for setting default behaviors rather than excessive `EXPECT_CALL`.

## 5. Usability and Debugging Aids

### Verbosity and Logging Controls
- The `--gmock_verbose` flag set to `info`, `warning`, or `error` controls the amount of logged detail from mock expectations.
- Detailed stack traces on expectation failures are available for in-depth debugging.

### Matchers and Actions Insights
- Comprehensive tracing of mock calls, including arguments and matched expectations, aids in diagnosing failing tests.
- Facilities to define custom matchers and actions to fit domain-specific testing needs, complemented by expressive failure messages.

## Best Practices Based on Recent Improvements

- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior to reduce brittle and overly strict tests.
- Prefer sequences (`InSequence`) when verifying call order.
- Utilize new matchers and `EXPECT_THAT` to write expressive assertions.
- For large mock classes, define constructors/destructors in `.cc` files to speed up compilation.
- Control verbosity in test runs with `--gmock_verbose` to balance informative logs with noise.
