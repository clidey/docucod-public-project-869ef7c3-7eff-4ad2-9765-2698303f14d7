# Notable Features & Improvements

This page highlights the most significant features and improvements introduced across recent major and minor releases. It aims to help you quickly grasp new capabilities, enhanced behaviors, and design patterns added to the framework so you can adopt and integrate them effectively into your workflow.

## Major and Minor Releases Overview

Each release is crafted with a focus on improving your experience with mocking in C++. From expanded mock method capabilities to refined strictness behaviors, these changes empower you to write clearer, more maintainable, and robust tests.

### Enhanced Mock Method Declarations

- **Flexible `MOCK_METHOD` Macro**: Support for detailed method qualifiers including `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, `Calltype(...)`, and reference qualifications (`ref(...)`) allows precise mocking of complex interfaces.

- **Improved Handling of Commas in Types**: Wrapping return or argument types containing commas inside extra parentheses, or using aliases, resolves parsing issues seamlessly.

- **Support for Overloaded and Templated Methods**: Mocking overloaded functions and class templates is straightforward with `MOCK_METHOD`; no additional boilerplate required.

### Strictness Modes for Mocks

- **NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock** classes let you control how your mocks handle uninteresting calls:
  - `NiceMock` suppresses warnings on calls without expectations.
  - `NaggyMock` (default behavior) warns on such calls.
  - `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as failures, enhancing correctness checks.

- These modes “inherit” constructors from the base mock classes, simplifying adoption even for mocks with arguments.

### Improved Expectation Syntax and Flexibility

- **Chaining Clauses in `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL`**: You can use `.With()`, `.Times()`, `.InSequence()`, `.After()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, and `.RetiresOnSaturation()` clauses with precise order enforcement.

- **Expectation Ordering and Sequencing**: Using `InSequence` or `After` allows you to specify strict or partial call orders, helping to verify complex call interactions reliably.

- **Automatic Cardinals Inference**: GoogleMock deduces call cardinality from the `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` clauses when `Times` is omitted, reducing boilerplate.

### Default and Custom Actions

- **Built-in Default Actions** support common return types, including void, primitive types, and default-constructible classes.

- **Chaining Multiple Actions** with `DoAll()` enables side effects combined with return values.

- **Delegation Techniques**: Easily delegate mock method behavior to fakes, real objects, or parent class methods for hybrid testing approaches.

- **Support for Move-only Types**: Returning and accepting `std::unique_ptr` and similar move-only types is fully supported in mocks.

### Advanced Matchers and Actions

- **Comprehensive Matcher Support**: From simple wildcard to compound and parameterized matchers, you can construct precise argument checks.

- **Custom Matcher and Action Definitions**: Create reusable, expressive custom matchers and actions using convenient macros or by implementing interfaces.

- **Safe Argument and Overload Disambiguation**: Use `SafeMatcherCast`, `Const()`, and `WithArgs` to finely control matcher and action behavior for overloaded and multi-argument methods.

### Enhanced Error Reporting and Debugging

- **Verbose Logging Control**: The `--gmock_verbose=LEVEL` flag (`info`, `warning`, `error`) adjusts diagnostic output, including call traces and stack information, aiding in root-cause analysis.

- **Stack Traces in Warnings**: When enabled, gMock includes stack traces on uninteresting or unexpected calls for quick localization.

- **Helpful Failure Messages**: Detailed mismatch reports showing arguments, pre-requisite expectations, and order violations assist rapid troubleshooting.

### Performance and Compilation

- **Optimized Mock Class Compilation**: Moving mock class constructors and destructors to `.cc` files speeds up builds significantly when mocking many methods.

- **Support for Advanced Use Cases**: Using mocks in multithreaded tests is safe under defined rules, and complex asynchronous behaviors are testable via GoogleMock actions and synchronization utilities.

### Usability Enhancements

- **Improved Support for Mocking Non-virtual and Free Functions**: Advanced recipes enable mocking by interface indirection or templated dependency injection.

- **Simplified Syntax for Setting Expectations Without Parameters**: You can omit argument matchers to express expectations on non-overloaded methods easily.

- **Checkpoints and Partial Ordering**: You can insert checkpoints and define DAGs of call order to model realistic execution flow constraints.

## Tips for Smooth Migration and Adoption

- If upgrading to versions introducing strict mock behaviors, thoroughly review and adapt your expectations and usages of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` as per your test goals.

- Review all mock methods with overloaded signatures to ensure all overloads are appropriately mocked or properly lifted with `using` declarations.

- When managing complex call ordering, leverage `InSequence` and `After` clauses to explicitly document dependencies and prevent brittle tests.

- Use default action clauses with `ON_CALL` thoughtfully to minimize uninteresting call warnings without overconstraining your tests.
