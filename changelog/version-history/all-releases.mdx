# All Releases

This page provides a comprehensive chronological list of all GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases, including version numbers, release dates, and highlight summaries. It is designed to help users quickly locate the relevant release for their projects and gain an overview of recent development activity.

## Release Listing

Releases are presented in **reverse chronological order** — the most recent release appears first. Each entry includes:

- **Version Number:** Following semantic versioning principles (major.minor.patch).
- **Release Date:** The exact date when the release was published.
- **Summary Highlights:** Key features, improvements, bug fixes, and other notable updates.

### Breaking Changes

Every release section clearly states if any breaking changes exist along with migration instructions to help maintain smooth transitions between versions. For example:

- Migration away from the deprecated `TestCase` type to `TestSuite` has been finalized.
- Macros with underscored naming conventions replaced with recommended API variants.
- Modifications in mock method qualifiers to support C++ qualifier consistency.

### Deprecated Features

Releases that mark features as deprecated are listed here with notices about timelines for removal and recommended alternatives.

Example:
