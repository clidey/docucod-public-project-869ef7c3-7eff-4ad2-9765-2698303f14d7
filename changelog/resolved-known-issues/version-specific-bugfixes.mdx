# Version-Specific Bug Fixes

This document summarizes the key bugs and regressions addressed across recent releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It highlights user-facing fixes to help developers verify resolved issues before upgrading, ensuring a smoother and more reliable testing experience.

## Bug Fixes in Recent Releases

### GoogleTest Core Fixes

- **Thread Safety and Synchronization Improvements**
  - Fixed potential race conditions in multi-threaded test environments where synchronization primitives were improperly handled, enhancing stability on systems using pthreads and Windows threading.
  - Corrected locking mechanisms in `Mutex` and `ThreadLocal` implementations to prevent deadlocks or data races under concurrent test execution.

- **Regular Expression Handling Updates**
  - Resolved bugs with regular expression matching in platforms using POSIX or RE2 engines where certain patterns failed or crashed unexpectedly.
  - Improved fallback behaviors for environments lacking POSIX regex support, enhancing robustness for embedded or restricted platforms.

- **Platform Detection and Macro Definitions**
  - Fixed misdetections on specific Windows and Unix variants that caused improper macro settings leading to compilation or runtime failures.
  - Adjusted auto-detection logic for availability of exceptions, RTTI, and file system support to align with modern compiler behaviors.

- **Stream Redirection and Death Test Stability**
  - Addressed issues where output capture (stdout/stderr) was unreliable or led to hangs on some platforms, improving the consistency of death test executions.
  - Fixed crashes that occurred in rare cases during death test child process launches.

- **Command Line Flags and Environment Variable Parsing**
  - Fixed parsing errors that caused environment variables or command line flags to be mishandled, ensuring proper configuration of test runs.

### GoogleMock-Specific Fixes

- **Mock Method Invocation and Expectations**
  - Fixed bugs where expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) on mock methods were not properly enforced in edge cases, such as when using strict or naggy mocks.
  - Corrected handling of overloaded and const-qualified mock methods in `MOCK_METHOD`, avoiding compile errors and unexpected behaviors.

- **Call Count Tracking and Cardinalities**
  - Addressed inaccuracies in call count tracking that could cause spurious failures or incorrect retirements of expectations when using `.Times()` clauses.

- **Matcher and Action Improvements**
  - Resolved corner cases causing matchers to incorrectly fail or succeed, especially for polymorphic and container matchers.
  - Fixed subtle bugs in action chaining and callback invocation mechanisms that affected default behaviors.

### Build System and Integration Fixes

- **CMake and Bazel Compatibility**
  - Corrected CMake build scripts to handle compiler flags more consistently across MSVC, Clang, and GCC.
  - Fixed Bazel build rules for better macro definition handling and improved linkage with optional dependencies like Abseil.

- **Compiler Compatibility Adjustments**
  - Resolved compilation warnings and errors by refining support for C++17 features, feature-test macros, and deprecated warnings on various toolchains.

### Documentation Fixes and Clarifications

- Improved documentation links and descriptions in key developer guides to reflect the latest API and macro usages.

## How to Verify Fixes Before Upgrading

1. **Review Release Notes and Archives:** Consult the complete release notes archive to identify whether your impacted issue has been addressed.
2. **Run GoogleTest Self-Validation:** Use included sample tests and validation suites to confirm library stability in your environment.
3. **Check Platform and Compiler Compatibility:** Confirm your toolchain and OS align with the supported versions as noted in the system requirements.
4. **Test Migration Guides:** If upgrading from older versions, verify compliance with breaking changes and deprecation schedules.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If you encounter build or runtime errors after upgrade, verify macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` and `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` are set appropriately for your platform.
- For multi-threaded test failures, ensure your environmentâ€™s threading primitives are properly detected and compatible.
- In case of deadlocks or hangs with death tests, review the `--gtest_death_test_style` flag and consider switching between `fast` and `threadsafe` modes.
