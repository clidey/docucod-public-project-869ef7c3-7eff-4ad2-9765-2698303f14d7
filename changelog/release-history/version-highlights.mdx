## Tips and Best Practices

- Always verify your toolchain supports the required C++ standard before upgrading.
- Use feature flags and runtime options documented in the core API reference to tailor test execution to your needs.
- Leverage improved mock behaviors and matchers to write clearer, more maintainable tests.
- Test your suite incrementally after updating to catch issues early.

Automation scripts and CI pipelines can consume this version log to enforce minimal GoogleTest version checks and display user-relevant highlights during build processes.

### Example snippet for CI integration

```bash
# Extract latest version and date from changelog
LATEST_VERSION=$(grep -m1 -oP '(?<=Version )[\d\.]+(?= \(Released)' changelog.md)
RELEASE_DATE=$(grep -m1 -oP '(?<=Released: )[\w\d ]+' changelog.md)
echo "Running tests with GoogleTest version $LATEST_VERSION (released on $RELEASE_DATE)"
```
