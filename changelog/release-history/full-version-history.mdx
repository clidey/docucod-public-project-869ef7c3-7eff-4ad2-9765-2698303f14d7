# Full Version History

This page provides a detailed chronological log of all GoogleTest releases, encompassing major, minor, and patch versions. Each entry links to corresponding release tags and in-depth release notes where available, enabling users to trace the evolution of the framework over time.

---

## Understanding the Full Version History

The Full Version History serves as a comprehensive timeline of all official GoogleTest releases. It helps users:

- Track new features, bug fixes, and enhancements added in each version
- Identify patch updates for quick fixes
- Review deprecated features and breaking changes
- Find links to detailed release announcements and notes

This chronological listing is critical for teams managing version upgrades and for developers seeking to maintain compatibility across different versions of GoogleTest.

### Versioning Structure

GoogleTest follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with the following format:

- **Major version (X)**: Indicates significant changes potentially with backward-incompatible API modifications.
- **Minor version (Y)**: Adds features in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Patch version (Z)**: Implements backward-compatible bug fixes.

Example: `1.17.0` means major version 1, minor 17, patch 0.

### Viewing Release Details

For many releases, detailed notes, highlights, and upgrade recommendations are available in linked release announcements. Users are encouraged to review these to fully understand the impact of changes on their codebase.

## Best Practices for Upgrading

When upgrading GoogleTest versions, keep the following in mind:

- **Review Breaking Changes:** Check release notes and the [Breaking Changes & Migrations](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/upgrade-notices/breaking-changes) guide to understand API or behavior modifications.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Run your full test suite on the new version to detect any integration or compatibility issues early.
- **Update Build Configurations:** Verify your build system is updated to meet new requirements, such as the need for C++17 in newer releases.
- **Follow Deprecations:** Remove usage of deprecated features promptly to ease future upgrades.
