# Full Version History

This page presents a comprehensive chronological record of every official release of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Each entry outlines the key improvements, fixed issues, enhancements, and any relevant platform or compatibility updates. This historical overview enables users to track the evolution of the framework, identify version-specific features, and plan upgrades accordingly.

## Understanding the Versioning Scheme

GoogleTest follows semantic versioning principles aligned with major, minor, and patch releases:

- **Major versions** introduce significant new features or potentially breaking changes.
- **Minor versions** add backward-compatible features and improvements.
- **Patch versions** focus on bug fixes, security updates, and minor enhancements.

All versions are tagged and documented to facilitate easy identification and migration.

## Compatibility and Platform Notes

- Versions 1.17.x and above require C++17 support and compatible compiler toolchains.
- Some older Linux distributions may require workaround or backported patches for full compatibility.
- Windows support includes adjustments for linking system libraries effectively in newer releases.
- MacOS tested with latest Xcode toolchains from version 1.15.x onward.

## Build System and Integration Updates

- CMake targets have evolved to simplify linking and incorporating GoogleTest components.
- Bazel workspace files updated to reflect new dependencies and test execution flags.
- The introduction of `gtest_main` and `gmock_main` pkg-config files helps automating library inclusion.

## Migrating Between Versions

- Users should consult the [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/upgrade-guidance/breaking-changes.md) document for migration-critical changes.
- Backward compatibility is maintained except where major version bumps indicate breaking API or behavior changes.
- Detailed upgrade instructions are provided in [Upgrade Instructions & Migration Tips](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/upgrade-guidance/upgrade-instructions.md).

## Tips for Using Version History Effectively

- **Stay Current:** Regularly upgrade to the latest minor or patch release to benefit from bug fixes and performance improvements.
- **Evaluate Dependencies:** Check your project's C++ standard and platform compatibility before upgrading.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Validate your test suites after upgrades to spot and adapt to any behavioral changes.
