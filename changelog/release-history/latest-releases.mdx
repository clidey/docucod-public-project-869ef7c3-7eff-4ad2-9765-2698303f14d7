# Latest Releases

This page presents an up-to-date overview of GoogleTest’s most recent releases, capturing major features, improvements, and community-impacting updates. It serves as a quick reference for users evaluating whether to upgrade or integrate the latest version into their projects.

## 1. Overview of Recent Major Releases

### Release Highlights
- **Major Versioning & C++17 Requirement**: Starting with version 1.17.0, GoogleTest requires a minimum of C++17 support, ensuring modern language features and improved developer experience.
- **Unified GoogleTest and GoogleMock**: The repository maintains integrated releases of both GoogleTest and GoogleMock, streamlining test and mock framework updates together.
- **Integration and Build Improvements**: Enhanced support for common build systems including CMake and Bazel, with simplified workflows to build GoogleTest and GoogleMock as standalone or integrated components.
- **Improved Runtime Configuration**: Introduction and refinement of runtime flags allow finer control over test verbosity, mock behavior, and diagnosis of leaks, enabling better troubleshooting.
- **Robust Multi-threading Support**: Improved thread-safety using pthread where available and platform-specific threading models to support concurrent test execution.

### Community and Ecosystem
- Broad adoption across major projects, including Chromium, LLVM, Protocol Buffers, and OpenCV.
- Active engagement through GitHub with steady contributions, user feedback, and beta releases.
- Plans to adopt Abseil dependencies to leverage Abseil’s portable C++ common libraries.

## 2. Latest Release Details

### Version 1.17.0 (Released YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Mandatory C++17 Standard**: Requires C++17 or newer compilers.
- **CMake Build Modernization**: Default inclusion of GoogleMock in builds; option to exclude via `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.
- **Enhanced Flag System**: Flags like `gmock_verbose`, `gmock_default_mock_behavior`, and others allow dynamic behavioral tuning and better output control.
- **Expanded Mocking Capabilities**: Improvements in mock method definitions using `MOCK_METHOD` macro, including better handling of qualifiers and complex signatures.
- **Improved Initialization API**: `InitGoogleMock()` now parses and absorbs GoogleMock flags, cleaning command line arguments and allowing mixed use of flags.

---

## 3. Important Changes Impacting Users

### Breaking Changes
- Removal of support for compilers older than those supporting C++17.
- Modifications in internal flag handling require reviewing custom initialization sequences.

### Deprecated Features
- Some legacy macros and flags are superseded by modernized APIs and may be removed in future versions.

### Migration Tips
- Update your build scripts to specify C++17 standard.
- Use the new initialization approach with `InitGoogleMock()` for proper flag parsing.
- Verify that all mock methods use the updated `MOCK_METHOD` macro syntax, especially with qualifiers like `const` and `override`.
