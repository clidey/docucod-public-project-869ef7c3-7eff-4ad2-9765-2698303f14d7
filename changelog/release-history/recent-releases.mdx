## Version 1.17.0 — Released on March 3, 2023

### Overview
The 1.17.0 release marks a significant milestone by upgrading GoogleTest and GoogleMock to require **at least C++17**, reflecting modern C++ standards for better language features and compiler optimizations. This update enforces improved code safety and expressiveness by leveraging newer language standards.

### Key Highlights
- **C++17 Requirement:** Minimum C++ standard raised; users must compile with C++17 or later.
- **Documentation Relocation:** Comprehensive documentation has been moved to GitHub Pages for better accessibility: [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/)
- **Support Policy Alignment:** The release conforms fully to Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy, ensuring consistency and long-term maintainability.

### Impact on Users
Users should update their build environments to support C++17. Most modern compilers already comply, but this may affect legacy projects. Transition guides are recommended to adjust compiler flags and verify compatibility.

## Troubleshooting Common Upgrade Issues

### Compiler Compatibility
- Ensure your compiler supports C++17; for GCC, Clang, MSVC recent versions support in full.
- Use standard CMake options such as `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`.

### Linking Errors
- Make sure to link with the correct GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries (`gtest_main`, `gmock_main`, or without main variants).
- Pay attention to threading flags especially when forcing pthread usage.

### Build Configuration
- Verify CMake minimum version and packages.
- Use provided `gtest_force_shared_crt` for dynamic runtime library compatibility on Visual Studio.

For detailed troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues.md) guide.
