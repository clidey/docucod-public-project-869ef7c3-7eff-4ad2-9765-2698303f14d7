## Example Entry: Version 1.17.0 (Released YYYY-MM-DD)

### Executive Summary
Version 1.17.0 advances GoogleTest’s foundational capabilities by enforcing C++17 as the minimum standard, refining build configurations for cross-platform compatibility, and continuing to lay groundwork for upcoming dependency integration.

### New Features
- **C++17 Minimum Standard:** Starting with 1.17.0, GoogleTest requires environments supporting C++17. This ensures modern language features improve test reliability and future-proofing.
- **Updated Build Support:** Enhanced CMake build scripts improve detection and setup, especially on Windows and Clang environments.

### Improvements
- Refined default compiler and linker flags to better handle shared/static runtime conflicts, especially on MSVC.
- More strict warning levels enabled across supported compilers, helping catch potential issues early.
- Support for configuring runtime flags to avoid common pitfalls in Visual Studio and clang-cl.

### Bug Fixes
- Corrected issues with multi-threaded test support using pthread detection and flags.
- Fixed conflicts with dynamic versus static runtimes causing linker errors.

### Known Limitations
- Dependency on external components such as Abseil and RE2 is planned but not yet integrated; users should plan accordingly.
- Certain complex build environments may require manual adjustment of the provided CMake options.

### Upgrade Guidance
- Ensure your compiler and environment support C++17 before upgrading.
- Review existing build scripts in your projects; upgrading to accommodate the new compiler flags may be required.

## Understanding Release Types

- **Major Releases:** Introduce significant features or API changes require your attention for migration.
- **Minor Releases:** Generally add features or improvements with backward compatibility.
- **Patch Releases:** Focus on bug fixes and security patches, usually safe to upgrade.
- **Pre-release/Beta:** May contain experimental features; recommended for testing, not production.

---

## Practical Tips for Upgrading

- Confirm your build environment matches the requirements specified for the version.
- Integrate unit tests with upgraded GoogleTest versions in a staging environment before rollout.
- Refer to the **Breaking Changes & Migration Guidance** page for detailed migration instructions if your upgrade includes breaking changes.

## Example User Scenario

Imagine you have been using GoogleTest 1.16.0 in your project. Upon seeing version 1.17.0 released:

1. You check the *New Features* to find that C++17 is now required.
2. Since your project is currently at C++14, you decide to plan migration to C++17.
3. Review *Improvements* and *Bug Fixes* to see benefits such as better cross-platform build support.
4. Consult *Upgrade Guidance* to anticipate changes you need in your CMake files.
5. Test the upgraded library and your tests in a staging environment following the recommended upgrade path.

This process helps you safely and confidently incorporate the enhancements GoogleTest offers with each new release.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues in Upgrades

- **Compilation Failures:** Ensure your compiler defaults to C++17 or later; adjust your build flags accordingly.
- **Linker Errors on Windows:** Check that your project and GoogleTest use matching runtime library settings (static vs dynamic).
- **Test Discovery Issues:** Validate that no deprecated macros or flag changes impact your test registration.

Refer to our [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues) guide for more details.
