# Release Notes by Version

Welcome to the comprehensive changelog page for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Here, you will find detailed release notes for every version, outlining new features, enhancements, bug fixes, deprecations, and other critical updates that directly impact your usage of the testing framework. This documentation helps you pinpoint what has changed in each release and understand how these changes can benefit your test development and execution workflows.

## Understanding Release Notes

Each release note provides a clear and actionable summary of the changes you can expect. These notes are crafted to support your upgrade decisions, guide adaptation to new features, and alert you to any deprecated or removed functionalities.

Our structured approach highlights:

- **New Features**: Innovations and additions that expand capability and simplify testing tasks.
- **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing features for better performance, usability, or stability.
- **Bug Fixes**: Corrections that address issues impacting test reliability or build processes.
- **Deprecations and Removals**: Notifications about features phased out, with guidance on alternatives.

## Navigating the Releases

Our changelog is organized in reverse chronological order, ensuring that the latest releases appear first. Each version entry includes:

- **Version Number and Release Date**
- **Executive Summary** of the release highlights
