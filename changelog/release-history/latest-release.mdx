## 2. Detailed Release Highlights

### 2.1 Modern C++17 Requirement

With version 1.17.0, GoogleTest has moved to require a minimum of C++17. This shift:

- Enables GoogleTest to use simplified and safer language constructs internally.
- Improves binary compatibility with modern toolchains.
- Means users must update their compiler and build settings accordingly.

### 2.2 Build System Enhancements

- **CMake:** Community contributions have strengthened CMakeLists and helper scripts, improving ease of integration.
- **Bazel:** The Bazel build files continue to support a broad spectrum of platforms and include configuration refinements to handle dependencies such as Abseil and RE2 when enabled.

### 2.3 GoogleMock Integration

- GoogleMock targets and libraries are fully aligned with the new GoogleTest core.
- The modular architecture offers flexible use of mock classes, with updated strictness controls and mock behavior defaults.

### 2.4 Documentation and User Resources

- The documentation migration to GitHub Pages offers direct access to guides, API references, FAQs, and best practice walkthroughs.
- Links from official repo README and landing pages now direct users to this updated documentation hub.

## 3. Upgrade and Migration Guidance

### 3.1 Upgrading from Previous Versions

- Confirm your compiler and project build pipelines support C++17 or later.
- Adjust your CMake or Bazel configurations according to the updated build files and options.
- For GoogleMock users, verify mock method declarations and expectations comply with updated API behaviors.

### 3.2 Breaking Changes and Deprecations

While this release focuses on improvements and maintenance:

- Some legacy code relying on pre-C++17 behavior may require refactoring.
- Deprecated APIs or flags (if any) will be documented separately in breaking changes notes.

Refer to the [Breaking Changes Documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md#breaking-changes) for detailed instructions.

## 4. Getting Started with the Latest Release

### 4.1 Installation

- Follow the updated installation guides for your platform with either CMake or Bazel.
- Ensure `BUILD_GMOCK` is enabled if using GoogleMock features.
- Link against new targets such as `gtest`, `gmock`, and `gtest_main` as appropriate.

### 4.2 Writing and Running Tests

- Begin with writing tests using new or existing GoogleTest macros.
- Leverage the improved support for typed and parameterized tests enabled by C++17 features.

### 4.3 Running Your First Test

- Compile and execute your test binaries as usual; the framework’s automatic test discovery remains unchanged.
- Use updated command line options and environment flags supported in this release.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Compiler Compatibility:** Make sure to use a compiler version that fully supports C++17.
- **Build Errors:** Check your build system’s definitions and flags against the latest CMakeLists or Bazel BUILD files.
- **Mocking Issues:** Review mock definitions for proper usage of `MOCK_METHOD` macros under new API guidelines.

## 7. Sample C++17 CMake Snippet to Build GoogleTest

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(MyTestProject LANGUAGES CXX)

# Set C++ standard to 17
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add GoogleTest subdirectory (assuming googletest is cloned in deps/googletest)
add_subdirectory(deps/googletest)

# Define your test executable
add_executable(sample_test test/sample_test.cpp)

# Link test executable with GoogleTest and GoogleMock
target_link_libraries(sample_test gtest gmock gtest_main)

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME sample_test COMMAND sample_test)
```
