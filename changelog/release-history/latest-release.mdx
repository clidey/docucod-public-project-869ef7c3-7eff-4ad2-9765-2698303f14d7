# Latest Release: GoogleTest

Stay informed with the most recent updates to GoogleTest, Google's trusted C++ testing framework. This page provides a practical overview of the latest release, summarizing key features, improvements, and critical fixes to help you confidently upgrade your testing environment.

## Overview of the Latest Release

The most recent version of GoogleTest introduces enhancements that elevate your testing experience, improve performance, and maintain compatibility with modern C++ standards. Understanding these changes empowers you to leverage GoogleTest effectively for robust, maintainable, and scalable tests.

### Key Features and Improvements

- **C++17 Minimum Support:** The latest 1.17.x branch requires at least C++17, ensuring that tests can benefit from the latest language improvements and modern idioms.
- **Enhanced Build System Support:** Improvements to CMake and Bazel build configurations simplify integrating GoogleTest in various environments, including clearer guidance on optional dependencies like Abseil.
- **Merged GoogleTest and GoogleMock:** Continuing the consolidation of these closely related projects, the release offers cohesive builds and streamlined APIs that enhance mocking and unit testing workflows.
- **Rich Set of Assertions and Test Control:** This release maintains support for xUnit-style tests, value-parameterized, and type-parameterized tests, with improved diagnostics and assertion macro behaviors.

### Notable Bug Fixes

- Resolved platform-specific build issues, especially on unsupported or edge systems.
- Fixed handling of thread-safety and concurrency in some test suites to ensure reliability in parallel test executions.
- Corrected installation paths and library linking in CMake builds, facilitating smoother setup.

<Tip>
Upgrading to this release improves test reliability and future-proofs your codebase by embracing modern C++ standards. However, because the minimum supported C++ version is now C++17, ensure your compiler and build environment satisfy this prerequisite.
</Tip>

## Upgrading and Compatibility Considerations

### Minimum Requirements

- **Compiler:** Must fully support C++17 as per Google's foundational C++ support policy.
- **Build Tools:** Compatible versions of CMake (minimum 3.16 recommended) or Bazel as per your setup.

### Migration Tips

- Review your build configurations to confirm compliance with updated CMakeLists and Bazel BUILD files.
- If your project uses Abseil dependencies, align them correctly as the GoogleTest build now optionally integrates with Abseil components.
- Test existing test suites thoroughly after upgrading, paying close attention to parameterized and death tests.

### Deprecated or Changed Behaviors

- Some internal linker options and flags may differ; verify linker and compiler flags post-upgrade.
- Direct usage of googlemock as a separate dependency is replaced with the merged framework; adapt includes and linkage accordingly.

<Warning>
Skipping the upgrade or ignoring the new C++17 requirement may lead to build failures or runtime issues. Always back up your current setup and run comprehensive tests after upgrading.
</Warning>

## How This Release Fits Into the Documentation Ecosystem

This page focuses strictly on the latest release highlights. To fully leverage the new capabilities and ensure smooth migration, consult related documentation:

- **[Installing with CMake](/getting-started/installation-initialization/install-cmake):** Detailed installation and configuration instructions aligned with the latest CMake support.
- **[Installing with Bazel](/getting-started/installation-initialization/install-bazel):** Guidance on Bazel integration reflecting recent changes.
- **[GoogleTest Primer](/guides/core-workflow/getting-started-tests):** For newcomers upgrading, refreshing the fundamentals expedites adaptation to changes.
- **[Breaking Changes & Deprecations](/changelog/breaking-changes-guidance/breaking-changes):** Essential for understanding upgrade impacts and migration strategies.

## Practical Example: Upgrading Your CMake Build

If you are using CMake, the updated `CMakeLists.txt` requires at least version 3.16. The release enables optional Abseil integration, as reflected below:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(googletest-distribution)
set(GOOGLETEST_VERSION 1.17.0)

option(BUILD_GMOCK "Builds the googlemock subproject" ON)
option(INSTALL_GTEST "Enable installation of googletest" ON)
option(GTEST_HAS_ABSL "Use Abseil and RE2" OFF)

if (GTEST_HAS_ABSL)
  find_package(absl REQUIRED)
  find_package(re2 REQUIRED)
endif()

if (BUILD_GMOCK)
  add_subdirectory(googlemock)
else()
  add_subdirectory(googletest)
endif()
```

Make sure your project includes these options appropriately and links with the updated targets.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues Post-Upgrade

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Topics">
<Accordion title="Build Failures Related to C++17 Requirement">
Ensure your compiler supports C++17 and your build environment uses appropriate standard flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker or Symbol Errors After Upgrade">
Verify that your linkage commands match the new library names and dependencies, especially if you link directly with `gtest` or `gmock` libraries. For CMake users, ensure targets like `gtest_main` and `gmock_main` are correctly linked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Integration Issues with Abseil Dependencies">
If using Abseil integration, confirm Abseil and RE2 libraries are present and visible to your build system as expected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Failures Unexpectedly Occur After Upgrade">
Review test code for deprecated assertions or calls incompatible with the new version. Pay attention to changes in death tests or parameterized test behavior.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
