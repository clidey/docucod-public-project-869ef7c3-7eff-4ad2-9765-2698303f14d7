---

## 2. Key Features and Improvements

### 2.1. Modernized Language Requirements
- This release **requires C++17** as a minimum language standard, enabling the use of modern C++ features internally for better performance and maintainability.
- Developers must ensure their build environment supports C++17 or above.

### 2.2. Improved Platform Compatibility and Support
- Aligns with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).
- Updated platform compiler and tool versions are documented in the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).
- Better detection and integration for multi-threading environments, including pthread improvements.

### 2.3. CI/CD and Continuous Integration Enhancements
- Further hardened internal CI pipelines provide more stable automated validation.
- Improved support for parallel test execution utilities such as **gtest-parallel**.
- Enhanced hooks for integration with external test runners and third-party listeners.

### 2.4. Documentation and Usability Updates
- Transitioned documentation hosting to [GitHub Pages](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
- Refreshed tutorials and guides to reflect the C++17 requirement and current best practices.
- Expanded references to integration workflows, mocking behavior customization, and platform portability tips.

### 2.5. Build and Installation Improvements
- Updated CMakeLists and build scripts for smoother cross-platform builds.
- New or improved CMake options for controlling runtime library linkage (e.g., `gtest_force_shared_crt`).
- Better guidance for incorporating GoogleTest & GoogleMock into existing projects, including examples for CMake and Bazel.

---

## 3. Notable Bug Fixes

- Resolved linkage mismatches in Visual Studio regarding dynamic versus static runtimes.
- Fixed issues with pthread detection flags leading to build failures on some platforms.
- Corrected visibility macros to enhance shared library compatibility.
- Addressed intermittent test failures related to death tests and test lifecycle events.

---

## 4. Upgrade Considerations

- **C++17 Requirement:** Projects upgrading must ensure that their toolchains and build configurations support at least C++17.
- **Runtime Library Flags:** Review project settings for runtime linkage flags, especially for Visual Studio users.
- **Deprecation and Compatibility:** No breaking API changes for typical test writing and mocking usage, but users should consult detailed compatibility notes if they rely on internal or advanced extension points.

<Tip>
Retain the practice of pinning your dependency versions and thoroughly validate test suites after upgrading to catch any compilation or runtime differences early.
</Tip>

## 5. Getting Started with v1.17.0

### 5.1. Installation
- Recommended approach: Using CMake with FetchContent to integrate GoogleTest & GoogleMock directly into your project.
- See the [Official Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html) for step-by-step instructions.
- Alternative builds using Bazel are supported as detailed in the Bazel installation documentation.

### 5.2. Writing and Running Tests
- Leverage all existing GoogleTest and GoogleMock APIs.
- Use the updated syntax and macros that now require C++17 features.
- Continue to use `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD()` as usual.

<Tip>
Ensure your compiler flags include `-std=c++17` or equivalent for your environment.
</Tip>

### 5.3. Documentation and Learning Resources
- Visit the main documentation site: [GoogleTest Documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
- Explore updated guides such as Writing Your First Test and Mocking Techniques adapting to the new version.

## Code Example: Typical CMake FetchContent Integration
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test PRIVATE gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_test COMMAND my_test)
```
