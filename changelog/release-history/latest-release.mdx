# Latest Release Notes

This page provides an in-depth look at the most recent GoogleTest and GoogleMock release, focusing on headline features, improvements in test discovery and assertion capabilities, updates to tooling, and important bug fixes. It serves as your primary reference point to understand what's new and enhanced in the current version of the GoogleTest/GoogleMock framework, empowering you to leverage the latest capabilities effectively.

---

## 1. Overview of the Latest Release

The latest release streamlines and elevates your testing experience by focusing on these core areas:

- **Enhanced Test Discovery:** Automated and more robust mechanisms now reliably identify and run your tests without manual registration.
- **Expanded Assertion Features:** Flexible and powerful assertion macros and matchers enable clearer, more expressive test validation.
- **Tooling Enhancements:** Updated build integration and configuration options improve your development workflow.
- **Key Bug Fixes:** Addressed several longstanding issues to improve stability and correctness in test execution and mocking.

The release aligns with modern C++ standards, ensuring compatibility with C++17 and above.

---

## 2. Key Features and Improvements

### 2.1 Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest continues to advance its automatic test discovery model. Tests defined with standard macros such as `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` are automatically registered and discovered at runtime. The test runner orchestrates execution in deterministic order, supporting parallelization where appropriate.

**Benefit:** Save time by eliminating manual test registration and reduce human error in keeping tests updated.


### 2.2 Assertions and Matchers

Recent updates expand the expressiveness and control over test assertions:

- Richer matchers for container contents, object properties, and function argument matching.
- Support for user-defined assertions to tailor checks tightly to your application logic.
- Clear separation between fatal and non-fatal failures, helping you decide whether a failure should abort a test or allow continued execution.

This empowers you to write more meaningful tests that communicate intent clearly and help pinpoint failures fast.


### 2.3 GoogleMock Improvements

GoogleMock offers:

- Declarative syntax with `MOCK_METHOD` macros for defining mocks with precision.
- Mechanisms for hybrid partial mocks, enabling mixing real and mocked behaviors.
- Flexible actions and matchers for complex mock behaviors and argument validations.

Recent improvements enhance sequence control, cardinality specification, and error messages for expectation violations, aiding debugging and stability.


### 2.4 Tooling and Build System Updates

- The CMake integration script (`CMakeLists.txt`) supports building GoogleTest and GoogleMock either as standalone projects or integrated subdirectories.
- Improved handling for building shared or static libraries with clear compiler flag options such as `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY`.
- Options to force dynamic runtime linkage on Windows with `gtest_force_shared_crt` to avoid linker conflicts.

**Tip:** Use the provided CMake build scripts and recommended flags to ensure consistent, smooth builds across platforms.

---

## 3. Notable Bug Fixes and Stability Enhancements

- Fixes related to multi-threaded test execution, ensuring thread-safety, especially on POSIX platforms using pthreads.
- Improved detection and linkage for pthread support on non-Windows platforms to prevent build errors.
- Enhanced clarity and robustness in mocking expectations and verifications, reducing flaky tests and unexpected failures.
- Addressed issues with macro name clashes by allowing users to rename macros such as `TEST` or `ASSERT_EQ` to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

These fixes ensure a more reliable and predictable test environment.

## 4. Getting Started with the Latest Release

### 4.1 Building with CMake

To build the latest version including GoogleMock (default):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
cd googletest
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

To build **only** GoogleTest (without GoogleMock):

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
make
sudo make install
```


### 4.2 Integration in Your Projects

- Use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` to locate installed headers and libraries.
- Link against `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gmock` targets for test executables.
- For embedding GoogleTest source during build, use CMake's `FetchContent` approach for streamlined dependency management.

Example snippet:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/v1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest_main gmock_main)
add_test(NAME my_test COMMAND my_test)
```


### 4.3 Runtime Configuration and Flags

- To enable or disable pthread usage in your environment, define `DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro appropriately.
- Rename conflicting macros to avoid clashes using flags like `DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build and Link Errors

- Windows users may encounter runtime library conflicts; resolve by setting `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake.
- Missing pthread linkage errors on Linux/macOS are typically fixed by enabling pthread explicitly or using the provided CMake scripts.

### Mock Expectation Failures

- Verify that mock methods are correctly defined with `MOCK_METHOD` and expectations set with `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrapper classes to control warnings and failures related to uninteresting calls.
