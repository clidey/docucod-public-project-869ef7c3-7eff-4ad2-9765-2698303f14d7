# Bug Fixes & Patch Notes

The **Bug Fixes & Patch Notes** section is dedicated to cataloging key corrections and stability improvements across GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. This resource is essential for developers aiming to understand resolved issues, track regressions, and ensure tests are reliable and performant over time.

---

## 1. Overview of Bug Fixes and Patches

Each release often includes fixes that address bugs reported by users or discovered internally. These fixes enhance the stability, correctness, and usability of mocking and testing features. As a user, this section assists you by:

- Diagnosing unexpected behavior changes after upgrades.
- Confirming that long-standing or critical issues have been resolved.
- Planning upgrades with awareness of risk mitigations.

A well-maintained bug fix log complements the release notes by highlighting smaller, targeted improvements that might not merit a feature spotlight but have significant user impact.

## 2. Recent Bug Fixes Highlights

### 2.1 Correctness Improvements

- Resolved cases where mock expectations were incorrectly reported as unmet despite matching calls occurring.
- Fixed issues around overloaded method mocking that led to ambiguous or failed matches.
- Addressed problems with call count verification causing false negatives in test validations.

### 2.2 Usability Fixes

- Improved diagnostics and error messages on unexpected or uninteresting method calls for clearer debugging.
- Enhanced matchers and action chaining behaviors to work reliably with move-only types and complex arguments.
- Fixed lifecycle issues where certain mocks did not verify expectations due to object leaks or improper destruction sequencing.

### 2.3 Performance and Stability

- Optimized internal mocking mechanisms to reduce compilation overhead and runtime latency, especially for tests with many mock methods.
- Resolved deadlock risks in multi-threaded tests involving mock objects.
- Improved handling of default actions and custom action combinations to avoid unexpected crashes.

## 3. Detailed Patch Examples

### Mock Method Declaration Fixes

Fixes in the handling of `MOCK_METHOD` declarations now better support:

- Methods with complex types containing commas (e.g., `std::pair` or `std::map`).
- Overloaded methods with `const` and non-`const` versions, preventing compiler warnings and ensuring correct matcher application.

### Expectation Matching Enhancements

Adjustments to the processing order of expectations ensure:

- More precise application of the "newer expectations override older ones" rule, reducing test flakiness.
- Correct treatment of expectations with sequences and partial orders, even under concurrent mock invocations.

### Strictness Wrapper Behavior

Bug fixes enhance the behavior of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` wrappers by:

- Guaranteeing that uninteresting calls produce the expected warnings or failures according to the wrapper level.
- Ensuring strict mocks consistently cause failures on unexpected calls, improving test reliability.

### Delegation and Default Actions

Improvements in delegation patterns include:

- Correct support for delegating calls to fakes, real objects, or parent class methods without losing expectations tracking.
- Enhanced `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` interaction to respect default actions properly, avoiding spurious warnings.

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls Addressed by Fixes

- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:** Previously confusing or noisy warnings on methods without explicit expectations have been clarified and can be controlled via `--gmock_verbose` flag.
- **Call Ordering & Sequences:** Fixes help prevent brittle tests when requiring calls in strict or partial orderings by making sequences and `After` clauses more robust.
- **Mock Leaks:** Improvements allow proper detection and reporting of leaked mocks to improve test hygiene.
- **Mocking Non-Virtual or Overloaded Functions:** Updated guidance and fixes ensure that mocking appears seamless for complicated method signatures and overloading scenarios.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips Using Patch Notes

If your tests suddenly fail or behave differently after upgrading to a newer GoogleMock version:

1. Review the patch notes relevant to your upgrade version to see if known issues affecting your code have been fixed.
2. Examine changes around mocking method declarations or expectation matching if you mock complex interfaces.
3. Check for alterations in strictness levels or default behaviors that might affect warnings or errors.
4. Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag during test runs to get detailed call matching and expectation logs.
5. Consult updated guides such as the [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md) and [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for new best practices influenced by bug fixes.

## 6. Version History and Links to Release Notes

For detailed bug fix listings per version and full release notes, refer to the official [GoogleTest GitHub releases page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases). Here you can find:

- Chronological history of releases.
- Security patches and critical fixes announcements.
- Feature additions disentangled from bug fixes.

---

## 7. Best Practices to Leverage Bug Fixes

- Always pin your test dependencies to a known version and read the patch notes before upgrading.
- Use mock strictness wrappers (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) appropriately to catch issues early.
- Apply sequences and partial order constraints thoughtfully; fixes improve reliability but test design matters.
- Incorporate delegation patterns carefully for complex mock behavior; fixes reduce pitfalls.
- Monitor warnings related to uninteresting calls and configure verbosity to filter noise appropriately.
