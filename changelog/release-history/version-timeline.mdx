# Version Timeline

An at-a-glance overview of major and minor GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions, release dates, and primary highlights. This timeline enables users to quickly track the progression of the project, identify key milestones, and select versions that align with their development needs and compatibility requirements.

## Understanding the Version Timeline

The Version Timeline is designed as a quick reference guide for developers and teams to monitor the evolution of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It presents a chronological sequence of releases highlighting new features, improvements, bug fixes, and platform support expansions.

By using this timeline, you can:

- Identify when important features were introduced or improved.
- Recognize deprecation points that might affect your existing tests.
- Gauge compatibility with your compiler and platform based on release dates and requirements.
- Decide the right version to upgrade to, balancing features and stability.


## Key Versioning Information

- **Major Versions** introduce significant new capabilities or architecture changes that may require migration.
- **Minor Versions** focus on incremental feature additions and usability improvements.
- **Patch Releases** typically address bug fixes and security updates.

### Important Version Milestones

| Version | Release Date | Highlights and Notes |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1.17.0  | 2023-XX-XX   | Requires C++17 or later. Planned Abseil integration. Enhanced cross-platform support. | 
| 1.16.0  | 2022-XX-XX   | Improved parameterized tests support, mock behavior controls refined. | 
| 1.15.0  | 2021-XX-XX   | Added typed and type-parameterized test improvements, better death test handling. |

*Note: For exact release dates and detailed changelogs, refer to the Detailed Release Notes page.*


## Navigating Your Version Choice

When choosing a version:

- Confirm your compiler supports at least C++17 starting 1.17.0.
- Review the breaking changes carefully if migrating between major versions.
- Check platform support for your operating system and build tools as reflected in the Supported Platforms documentation.
- Consider integration points with your build system and CI environment.


## Tips for Working with Version History

- **Stay Updated:** Regularly consult the Version Timeline when planning upgrades or troubleshooting issues.
- **Check for Deprecations:** Look out for features marked for removal or changed behaviors that might impact your tests.
- **Use Semantic Versioning:** Understand GoogleTest's versioning scheme to anticipate the nature of changes.


## Example Scenario

Imagine your team relies heavily on typed tests and recently upgraded to a newer compiler supporting C++17. By consulting this Version Timeline, you identify that version 1.17.0 introduces enhanced typed test features with C++17 as a minimum, making it an optimal upgrade target. You then consult the Detailed Release Notes and Breaking Changes documentation to prepare your migration.
