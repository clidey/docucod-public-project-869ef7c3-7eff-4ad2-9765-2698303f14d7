# All Releases Timeline

Explore a comprehensive, chronological inventory of all GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions. This page presents each release entry—major, minor, and patch—in reverse chronological order, enabling you to trace the evolution of the project at a glance.

Each version summary highlights the core changes introduced, focusing on key improvements, feature additions, bug fixes, or critical updates relevant to users looking to understand what each release delivers. This structure enables efficient identification of versions containing substantial updates or urgent patches.

## Navigating the Releases

The timeline begins with the latest release and moves backwards to earlier versions, providing clear release dates and version numbers to support precise referencing.

Users can scan for:

- **Major releases:** Introducing breaking changes, new features, or significant API additions.
- **Minor releases:** Bringing incremental improvements or notable enhancements.
- **Patch releases:** Focused on bug fixes, stability, or security patches.

Each entry is summarized with user-centric language emphasizing the impact and value of the changes.

## Example Release Entry

### Version 1.13.0 — Released June 2024

- Added support for mocking methods with move-only types, improving interaction testing for modern C++ codebases.
- Enhanced error reporting to include detailed call stack information on failed expectations.
- Fixed inconsistencies in `EXPECT_CALL` invocation order enforcement, ensuring predictable behavior.

Users upgrading from earlier versions should review the specific section on breaking changes (if applicable) to understand migration requirements.

## Using the Timeline

This list empowers developers and testers to:

- Quickly identify which release introduced a particular feature or fix.
- Decide which version best fits their project needs based on stability and functionality.
- Prepare for migrations by recognizing deprecated or changed behaviors.

<Tip>
For an in-depth look into individual release notes, including detailed bug fixes and feature descriptions, please consult the "Features & Improvements" and "Bug Fixes & Stability Updates" pages.
