# Version Overview

An at-a-glance timeline summarizing the releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page helps users track the history of major, minor, and patch updates, providing context on the cadence, scope, and intent behind each release.

## Understanding GoogleTest and GoogleMock Versioning

GoogleTest and GoogleMock follow a clear versioning approach to help you understand the impact of each update and plan upgrades accordingly. Versions are structured in the standard semantic format:

- **Major**: Indicates significant changes, possibly including API breaks or notable new features
- **Minor**: Adds backward-compatible features or may include enhancements
- **Patch**: Contains backward-compatible bug fixes and minor improvements

This versioning scheme ensures that you can confidently update to the latest patch without breaking existing test suites and can prepare for potential migrations with major releases.

## Release Cadence and Update Frequency

Historically, GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases are frequent to incorporate improvements, fixes, and compatibility enhancements:

- Patch releases occur regularly to address bugs quickly
- Minor releases bring new testing capabilities aligned with user feedback and evolving C++ standards
- Major releases are less frequent and accompany architectural enhancements or breaking API changes

Monitoring the timeline helps anticipate when to upgrade and how those upgrades might affect your test infrastructure.

## Highlights of Notable Releases

Although this page summarizes all versions, here are examples of key updates users found impactful:

- Introduction of typed and parameterized tests improving test reuse and coverage
- Enhanced mocking abilities such as advanced action chaining and more expressive matchers
- Integration improvements for CMake and Bazel build systems
- Portability updates supporting diverse platforms and environments including embedded systems
- Introduction of flags and verbosity levels in GoogleMock for better diagnostics

Keep an eye on the latest patch releases to benefit from ongoing stability improvements.

## Migration and Upgrade Guidance

Major versions may introduce breaking changes in test macros, initialization routines, or mock definitions. When upgrading:

- Review the release notes for deprecations and required code updates
- Use documented migration guides to adapt test fixtures, mock classes, and build configurations
- Run the test suite after upgrading to validate

Always synchronize GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions to avoid compatibility issues.

## Typical User Flow for Upgrading

1. **Stay Informed**: Review this changelog page regularly to understand new releases
2. **Plan**: Evaluate new features and breaking changes against your current test code
3. **Test Locally**: Build and run tests with the new version in a controlled environment
4. **Update CI**: Upgrade your continuous integration environment and verify stability
5. **Deploy**: Roll out the update across your project while monitoring test performance

## Tips for Maintaining Test Suite Compatibility

- Use recommended macros and APIs consistently to minimize future migration effort
- Avoid deprecated features by tracking release notes and deprecation warnings
- For mocking, use the latest recommended syntax for defining mocks and expectations
- Leverage verbose output mode in GoogleMock to diagnose unexpected behaviors

## Troubleshooting Version-Related Issues

If you encounter problems such as failing tests or build issues after upgrading:

- Confirm that your build system uses the intended GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions
- Verify that your compiler meets the supported C++ standard (typically C++17 or later)
- Check for API changes in the latest release notes or migration documentation
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/first-test-run/troubleshooting-setup.mdx) guide
