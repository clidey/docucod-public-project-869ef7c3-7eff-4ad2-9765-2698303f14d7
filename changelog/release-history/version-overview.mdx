# Version Overview & Timeline

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have evolved through a series of major and minor releases, each carefully designed to enhance capabilities, fix issues, and improve integration with diverse development workflows. This page provides a structured timeline of these releases, giving users a clear understanding of which features became available when and how the libraries have matured over time.

---

## Understanding the Version Timeline

The version timeline is organized chronologically from the latest to earlier releases, enabling you to track the evolution of the frameworks efficiently. Each entry summarizes key improvements, such as new feature introductions, bug fixes, ecosystem integrations, and enhancements in stability or performance.

The timeline assists you in:

- **Identifying feature availability**: Know exactly when important functionalities were introduced.
- **Planning upgrades**: Evaluate the benefits and risks by reviewing fixes and breaking changes for each version.
- **Ensuring compatibility**: Understand changes in ecosystem support, including compilers, platforms, and build tool integrations.

## How to Use This Page

This page is meant to support your decision-making around adopting new versions or troubleshooting issues linked to specific releases. It focuses specifically on GoogleTest and GoogleMock combined version releases.

Consider it as your quick reference to answer:

- "Does this version support my platform or compiler?"
- "When was a particular bug fixed?"
- "What new mocking or assertion features have been introduced recently?"

For detailed technical usage, setup, and integration guidance, consult other documentation pages as linked below.

## Release Entries

### Versioning Format

Versions follow semantic versioning principles: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** releases introduce significant new features and/or breaking changes.
- **MINOR** releases add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** releases fix bugs and improve reliability without changing APIs.

### Latest Release Highlights

#### v1.17.0 (Main Branch)
- Introduced improved handling of move-only types in mocks, enabling better support for modern C++ standards.
- Enhanced CMake build scripts to support dynamic runtime linkage options, easing integration on MSVC and Windows platforms.
- Updated GoogleMock to support additional qualifiers in mocked methods, such as `noexcept` and reference qualifiers.
- Strengthened thread-safety guarantees for test runs and mocks.
- Improved platform support matrix with clarified compatibility for recent compiler versions.

#### Prior Release v1.16.0
- Added value-parameterized test improvements, including easier syntax for instantiating typed tests.
- Fixed several bugs related to parameterized tests and multi-threaded test execution.
- Expanded mocking framework with new matcher combinators for improved argument validation.

### Breaking Changes

- Users compiling with Visual Studio must now explicitly configure runtime linkage via `gtest_force_shared_crt` to avoid library conflicts.
- The minimum compiler requirement is C++17 standard compliance. Builds on older standards are unsupported and will fail (confirmed in internal compatibility checks).
- Deprecated old macro-based mock definitions (`MOCK_METHODn`) in favor of the unified `MOCK_METHOD` syntax. Migration guides are available.

### Deprecations

- Legacy build methods without CMake support are deprecated; users are encouraged to use the provided CMake or Bazel build workflows.
- Use of non-`override` qualifiers in mock methods is discouraged and flagged for removal in future versions.

### Security and Stability Updates

- Several issues related to incorrect matcher evaluation on edge cases have been fixed.
- Patching internal synchronization mechanisms to prevent rare race conditions observed in heavily parallelized test suites.

## Practical Tips for Version Use

- **Stay updated with stable releases** for the best balance of features and stability.
- Use **patch releases promptly** to benefit from important bug fixes, especially related to platform compatibility and multi-threading.
- Before upgrading to a new major version, review the **breaking changes and deprecation notices** carefully and follow the migration notes.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues that may relate to changes between versions:

- Verify your build environment matches the **supported platforms** and compiler versions as described in [Platform Support and Build Integration](../overview/integrations-and-ecosystem/platform-support-and-build-integration.md).
- Refer to the [Installation Instructions](../getting-started/setup-introduction/installation-instructions.md) to ensure proper setup.
- Review [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](../getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting.md) for common pitfalls.
- Check if your problems relate to mocking by consulting the [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md).
