## Versioning and Release Cadence

GoogleTest follows a semantic versioning scheme:

- **Major versions** introduce significant new features and potential backwards-incompatible changes.
- **Minor versions** add functionality and improvements in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Patch releases** focus on bug fixes and minor refinements without breaking changes.

Releases typically follow a regular cadence but may vary based on contributions and testing cycles.
