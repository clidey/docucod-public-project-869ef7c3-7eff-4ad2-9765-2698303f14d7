## Highlights of Recent Releases

### GoogleTest 1.17.0 (Released)

- **Minimum C++17 Requirement**: This release mandates a C++17-compliant compiler. Projects integrating GoogleTest now need to ensure C++17 support is enabled. This upgrade unlocks modern language features and improves compatibility.

- **Unified GoogleTest & GoogleMock Repository**: GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects have been merged into a single repository, simplifying dependency management and streamlining releases.

- **Improved Build via CMake FetchContent**: GoogleTest now supports seamless integration into existing CMake projects using `FetchContent` with `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`. This allows for effortless, reproducible builds without manual source management.

- **Visual Studio Runtime Linking Option**: To resolve common runtime conflicts on Windows, a new CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` lets you force dynamic linking of the C runtime libraries, matching Visual Studio's defaults and avoiding linker errors.

- **Thread Safety and Pthread Control Macros**: GoogleTest continues offering configurable threading support for environments with or without pthreads. Macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` can be set explicitly, enabling reliable multi-threaded test execution.

- **Shared Library Support**: GoogleTest can now be built and linked as a shared library. Compiler and linker flags `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` control this behavior.

- **Macro Name Clash Avoidance**: For projects facing macro naming conflicts with GoogleTest (e.g., `ASSERT_EQ`), defining macros such as `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` enables GoogleTest to rename conflicting macros with a `GTEST_` prefix, avoiding collisions.

- **Test Execution Enhancements**: New flags and options have been added or improved for running tests with specific filters, repeat counts, seed control, and output formatting, giving users finer control over test execution.


## Additional Enhancements

- **Improved Documentation and User Guides**: Documentation is now prominently hosted on GitHub Pages with better navigation, updated examples, and clearer explanations to enhance the onboarding experience for new and existing users.

- **Expanded Assertion Macros and Matchers**: Additional assertion macros and matcher capabilities have been refined for richer test expressiveness.

- **Event Listener API Enhancements**: Users can now better customize test event tracking, enabling integration with external test runners and reporting systems.

## How These Changes Benefit You

- **Modern Language Features**: Upgrading to C++17 lets you leverage new standard features for cleaner, more maintainable tests.

- **Simplified Integration**: Using CMake FetchContent reduces the overhead of managing source dependencies and ensures consistent builds across platforms.

- **Enhanced Windows Support**: The dynamic runtime linkage option fixes frequent Visual Studio linking issues, offering a smoother Windows development experience.

- **Configurable Threading and Library Options**: Adjust threading and linking based on your platform and build needs, ensuring robust parallel test execution.

- **Avoid Macro Conflicts**: Customize macro definitions to coexist seamlessly with other libraries using conflicting macro names.

- **Better Test Control and Feedback**: Fine-tune test runs with updated flags and enjoy more comprehensive test lifecycle hooks with event listeners.
