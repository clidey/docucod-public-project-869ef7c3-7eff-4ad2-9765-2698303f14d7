# Major Features & Improvements

This documentation page details the headline features and notable improvements introduced in each major release of GoogleTest. It focuses on key advancements in C++ standards support, test discovery enhancements, expanded assertion types, and integration upgrades that directly improve the testing experience and robustness.

---

## Supported C++ Standards

- **Minimum C++17 Requirement:** Starting with version 1.17.x, GoogleTest enforces C++17 as the minimum supported C++ standard. This update aligns with modern C++ best practices and unlocks language and standard library features for enhanced type safety and performance.

- **Compatibility Alerts:** Users must ensure their build environment supports at least C++17 to build and use GoogleTest successfully. This modern baseline optimizes code maintainability and future-proofs testing.

---

## Test Discovery Enhancements

- **Automatic Test Registration:** GoogleTest continues to provide seamless test discovery by implicitly registering tests defined with the `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros. No manual listing or registration is required.

- **Expanded Test Identification:** Improvements have been made to reliably discover typed tests, type-parameterized tests, and parameterized tests, broadening coverage in complex testing scenarios.

- **Filter and Execution Controls:** New command-line options and flag improvements enable finer control over test filtering, selective execution, and test sharding to speed up large test suites.

---

## Expanded Assertion Types

GoogleTest now supports a richer set of assertions to cater to diverse verification needs:

- **Enhanced Predicate Assertions:** Additional predicates and macros simplify expressing custom validation logic within tests.

- **Float and Double Comparisons:** Improved floating-point comparison assertions handle edge cases and tolerance specifications more predictably.

- **Integrated Exception Testing:** Assertions for expected exception types and messages have been refined for clearer semantics and reporting.

---

## Integration Upgrades

- **GoogleMock Bundled Integration:** Since the merger with GoogleMock, users benefit from a unified mocking and testing experience, inclusive of an intuitive DSL for setting mock expectations, actions, and verifying interactions.

- **Build System Compatibility:** The CMake build scripts are updated for better integration, including native support for concurrent test executions and system-specific optimizations.

- **Continuous Integration Support:** Enhanced support with internal CI workflows ensures smoother automated testing routines and more detailed XML output for test reports.

## Practical Implications for Users

### Smooth Migration
To benefit from the latest features such as C++17 support and improved test discovery, users should verify compiler compatibility and update build configurations as needed.

### Enhanced Testing Capabilities
The expanded assertions and matcher sets allow writing more expressive and reliable tests, catching subtle bugs earlier.

### Faster Test Execution
With refined test filtering and parallel execution options, large test suites execute more efficiently, reducing feedback cycles during development.
