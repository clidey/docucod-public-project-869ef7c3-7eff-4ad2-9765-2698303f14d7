## Tips for Managing Upgrades

- **Check Required C++ Standard:** Since versions like 1.17.x require C++17, verify your build environment compatibility before upgrading.
- **Use Migration Guides:** Pay attention to deprecation notices and utilize provided upgrade instructions.
- **Backup Tests and Environments:** Preserve prior versions and test results before upgrading.
- **Review Test Output Changes:** Ensure your CI systems and test report parsers accommodate any format modifications.

## Troubleshooting Release-Specific Challenges

If you encounter issues after upgrading, consider:

- Reviewing bug fix notes and known issues for your version.
- Checking compatibility with your build system and platform.
- Confirming your test code does not mix `TEST` and `TEST_F` incorrectly within the same suite.
- Utilizing flags such as `--gtest_list_tests` to verify test discovery.
