# Detailed Release Notes

This page offers comprehensive release notes for each version of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, focusing on bug fixes, feature improvements, and resolved issues. It is designed to help users understand the full scope of changes in each release so they can plan their upgrades and leverage new features effectively.

## Latest Release

**Version:** *Refer to the main release documentation for exact version numbers*

**Release Date:** *Refer to the official release announcements*

### Executive Summary
This release further stabilizes GoogleMock's behaviors and output messages, improving developer experience through more informative logs and better warning control. It enhances the robustness of expectation handling and default action management.

### New Features and Improvements
- Enhanced verbosity control of mock function call traces with `--gmock_verbose` flag, allowing fine-grained insight during test debugging.
- Added support for overriding mock strictness with new wrappers `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`, enabling flexible control over uninteresting call behavior.
- Improved the `EXPECT_CALL()` macro to correctly infer call cardinalities based on `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` usage.
- Upgraded warning and error messages for unmatched, uninteresting, or excessive mock calls with clearer diagnostic descriptions.
- Improved handling of expectations retirement using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to simplify complex call sequencing.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed spurious warnings for methods mocked with `const` parameters in Microsoft Visual C++ compilers.
- Resolved issues where multiple identical failure messages were printed for failed expectations at different call times.
- Addressed memory and heapcheck failures caused by non-virtual destructors in mock classes.
- Corrected corner cases where default actions would not properly apply after explicit actions run out.

### Breaking Changes
- No major breaking changes. However, users are encouraged to verify usage of `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.WillRepeatedly()` clauses to align with updated cardinality inference logic.

### Deprecation Notices
- Legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros continue to be supported but migration to newer `MOCK_METHOD` style is recommended.

### Security Updates
- No specific security vulnerabilities reported in this release.
