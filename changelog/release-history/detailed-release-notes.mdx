## Recent Releases

### Version 1.17.0 (Released 2024-05-01)

#### Enhancements
- Updated minimum C++ standard to C++17, refining modern codebase compatibility and feature support.
- Improved integration with Abseil dependencies for enhanced internal string and flag handling.
- Enhanced matchers and actions in GoogleMock for more expressive mock behavior control.
- Advanced output formatting and JSON report generation for better CI consumption and tooling compatibility.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a threading-related race condition affecting death tests on some Linux environments.
- Resolved issues in the POSIX regular expression wrapper that caused false negatives in partial matches.
- Addressed cross-platform file system handling quirks impacting test executable detection.
- Corrected flag parsing behavior for multi-value filters to prevent unintended test exclusions.

#### Adjustments
- Deprecated legacy "fast" death test style in favor of the more robust "threadsafe" default.
- Streamlined test event listener APIs for improved extensibility and ease of use.
- Refined color output auto-detection for terminals to reduce false positives on non-terminal outputs.

#### Compatibility Notes
- This release requires redevelopment of users' test binaries with at least a C++17 compliant compiler.
- Users employing custom build scripts should ensure that `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY` and `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` flags are properly set when building shared libraries.

---

### Version 1.16.5 (Patch Release, 2023-12-15)

#### Bug Fixes
- Patched a critical regression causing false failure reports when using parameterized tests with certain types.
- Fixed a memory leak in the mock object lifecycle management under some test ordering scenarios.
- Corrected XML output timestamp formatting to comply with ISO 8601 standards.

#### Adjustments
- Improved diagnostics in assertion failure messages to include additional context from predicate-format assertions.

---

### Version 1.16.0 (Minor Release, 2023-10-10)

#### Enhancements
- Added support for user-defined print-to-string customization via `AbslStringify` integration.
- Introduced improvements in the thread-local storage abstraction to support additional platforms.
- Enhanced `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and related macros for testing expected failure behavior in multithreaded tests.

#### Bug Fixes
- Resolved incompatibilities with certain Windows compilers in dynamic linking scenarios.
- Fixed an edge case in value-parameterized test instantiation that caused test duplication.

---

### Version 1.15.0 (Major Release, 2023-06-20)

#### Enhancements
- Refactored internal components to improve build system compatibility, including Bazel and CMake.
- Added advanced mocking frameworks with enhanced cardinality and action controls.
- Improved test sharding support enabling more effective parallel execution across multiple machines.
- Expanded test output formats, including JSON reporting suitable for integration with modern CI pipelines.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed assertion macro name collisions in scenarios enabling `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_*` flags.
- Patched issues with death test process isolation and synchronization causing intermittent failures.

#### Adjustments
- Defaulted new test suites to be run before death tests to preserve thread safety during test execution.
- Revised documentation and samples to reflect new recommended practices for setting up and running tests.
