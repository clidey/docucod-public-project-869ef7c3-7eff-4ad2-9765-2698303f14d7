# Full Version History

A thorough, time-ordered record of all releases and updates to the GoogleTest project, providing users clear insights into what each version introduced, fixed, or changed. This history enables users to evaluate project stability, understand new capabilities, and plan upgrades confidently.

---

## 1. Overview of Versioning

GoogleTest follows semantic versioning principles, with versions typically formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR** versions introduce significant changes which may break backward compatibility.
- **MINOR** versions add new features and improvements in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** versions primarily contain bug fixes and minor updates without adding new features.

The version history is organized chronologically from earliest releases to the latest, with emphasis on major milestones and incremental improvements.

## 2. Chronological Listing of Releases

### Version 1.17.0 â€” June 2022
- **Highlights:**
  - Updated to require **C++17** standard as a baseline.
  - Integrated GoogleMock and GoogleTest into a unified repository and release flow.
  - Improved documentation with live GitHub Pages.
  - Enhanced portability and support for newer compilers.

### Earlier significant versions (Summary):
- Versions prior to 1.17.x progressively improved test discovery, added extensive assertion macros, and enhanced GoogleMock integration.
- Established multi-threaded testing support and refined cross-platform compatibility.
- Introduced advanced mocking features including partial mocks and rich argument matchers.

*Note: A detailed log of all patch versions and intermediate minor releases can be found on the official [GitHub release page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases).*

## 3. Major New Features and Improvements

- **Unified Framework:** The consolidation of GoogleTest and GoogleMock repositories and releases streamlines user adoption and maintenance.
- **Enhanced Language Support:** Transition to requiring C++17 allows use of modern language features for better performance and usability.
- **Improved Build and Integration:** CMake scripts and package configurations have been refined to simplify integration into various build systems and environments.
- **Expanded Test and Mocking Capabilities:** Continuous additions to assertion types, matchers, actions, and mock modes ensure more precise and expressive test definitions.

---

## 4. Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

Each patch release addresses issues reported by the community, such as:

- Fixes for platform-specific build and runtime errors.
- Improvements to thread safety and concurrency handling.
- Resolution of corner case failures in mock expectations and assertion handling.
- Documentation clarifications to improve user guidance and reduce setup friction.

---

## 5. Deprecated Features and Removal Notices

GoogleTest follows a clear policy on deprecations where features or macros may be phased out over several releases. Users are advised to monitor release notes for:

- Deprecated macros or flags and their recommended replacements.
- Changes to default build scripts or compiler flags that may impact legacy projects.
- Planned removal of older platform or compiler support.

***Migration and Upgrade tips*** are provided in the related [Upgrade Guides and Migration Tips](./upgrade-guides.md) documentation.

---

## 6. Security Updates

While GoogleTest primarily consists of test framework code which runs locally, security patches related to dependencies or build tools are documented if applicable.

## 7. Accessing Detailed Release Notes

Detailed notes and descriptions for all releases can be found on the official GoogleTest GitHub repository release page:

[https://github.com/google/googletest/releases](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases)

Users are encouraged to review release notes specific to their version upgrades to understand impacts and enhancements fully.

---

## 8. Recommended Upgrade Paths

- **From pre-1.10.x:** Consider upgrading directly to 1.17.x to gain C++17 advantages and unified GoogleMock support.
- **Patch upgrades:** Follow patch updates closely for bug fixes and stability.
- Always test existing test suites after upgrades to catch any breaking changes or behavioral adjustments.

Refer to the [Breaking Changes](./breaking-changes.md) and [Upgrade Guides](./upgrade-guides.md) for detailed migration assistance.
