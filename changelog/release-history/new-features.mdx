## Recent Releases

### [Latest Release]
- **Includes:** Detailed list of newly introduced features, performance improvements, enhanced matchers and actions, as well as increased mocking flexibility
- **Highlights:** Improvements to mock method handling for move-only types, enhanced default actions with ON_CALL, and enriched cardinality support in EXPECT_CALL
- **User Impact:** Enables writing cleaner, more expressive tests with better control over mock behaviors

### Release Highlights
- _Mocking Enhancements:_ Support for move-only types fully integrated, allowing seamless use of `std::unique_ptr` in mocks.
- _Advanced Actions:_ Improved support for side-effect modeling with new built-in actions such as `SetArrayArgument` and `InvokeArgument` for callback-based testing.
- _Sequencing and Ordering:_ Greater flexibility in enforcing call order using `InSequence` and `After` clauses, aiding complex interaction testing.
- _Mismatch Diagnostics:_ More descriptive failure messages and enhanced verbose logging options (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to assist in debugging.

## Breaking Changes

Occasionally, major releases include breaking changes to improve the framework's robustness or to align with modern C++ standards.

- Expectation and Action Clause Ordering: `EXPECT_CALL` clauses must follow specified ordering rules (e.g., `Times` before `InSequence`). Incorrect ordering will now trigger explicit errors.
- Deprecated Macros: Old-style `MOCK_METHODn` macros are discouraged and replaced by versatile `MOCK_METHOD` syntax.
- Behavior of Sticky Expectations: Expectations are sticky by default unless `.RetiresOnSaturation()` is specified. This change affects tests relying on previous non-sticky behavior.

Migration guidance for these changes is available in the [Breaking Changes](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/break-migrate-deprecate/breaking-changes) documentation.

---

## Deprecations and End-of-Life Notices

- The legacy `MOCK_CONST_METHODn` and `MOCK_METHODn` macros are deprecated in favor of `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Some older matching macros are superseded by polymorphic matcher factories.
- Users should transition to the `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` types for controlling uninteresting call behaviors instead of custom workarounds.

Refer to [Deprecations and End-of-Life Notices](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/break-migrate-deprecate/deprecations) for details and timelines.

## Security Updates

Though primarily a testing framework, GoogleTest occasionally includes patches addressing potential security vulnerabilities detected in underlying components such as logging or internal APIs. Users are advised to stay current with releases to benefit from these safeguards.

## Release History

### Overview
This section catalogs previous releases in reverse chronological order with summaries:

#### Version 1.x.x - YYYY-MM-DD
- Added comprehensive support for mocking templated and overloaded methods.
- Enhanced action composition with `DoAll` and `IgnoreResult` for complex test scenarios.
- Introduced cardinality expressions such as `AtLeast()` and `Between()` for flexible call count constraints.

#### Version 0.x.x - YYYY-MM-DD
- Initial stable release of GoogleMock integrated into GoogleTest.
- Provided core macros including `MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`, and `ON_CALL`.
- Laid foundation for user-friendly matchers and actions.

---

## Best Practices Highlighted in Recent Changes

- **Use `ON_CALL` to set defaults:** Define default behaviors to keep tests resilient and avoid over-asserting interactions.
- **Set expectations precisely:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying interactions that matter, avoiding brittle tests.
- **Leverage sequences and partial orders:** When call order matters, use `InSequence` and `After` clauses to clearly express dependencies.
- **Manage sticky expectations:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations retire when saturated and prevent upper-bound violations.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Uninteresting call warnings:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress unnecessary warnings when calls to mocks are not explicitly expected.
- **Confusing failures due to method overloads:** Explicitly specify argument types or use wrapper methods to disambiguate mocked overloads.
- **Mocking move-only types:** Define lambdas in `WillOnce()`/`WillRepeatedly()` to handle return of `unique_ptr` or similar types correctly.
