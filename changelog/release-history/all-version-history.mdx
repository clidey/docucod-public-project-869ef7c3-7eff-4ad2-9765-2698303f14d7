## Understanding the Release History

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are released together as a unified framework. This page documents their version histories side by side to provide clarity on feature availability, fixes, and improvements across both components.

Each version is presented in **reverse chronological order**—most recent first—to ensure immediate visibility of the latest updates.

## What You Will Find Here

- **Version Numbers and Release Dates:** Precise versioning follows semantic versioning principles, reflecting the scope of changes.
- **Core Highlights:** Each entry captures the essence of the release, spotlighting significant features, API additions, enhancements to mocking capabilities, and resolved issues.
- **Impact on Users:** Focused explanations orient users on how the changes affect test writing, mocking behavior, and overall framework usage.

## Example Release Highlights

>### Version 1.17.0 (Released Date: TBD)
>- Introduced minimum C++17 requirement, improving language feature support and modern code idioms.
>- Unified GoogleTest and GoogleMock repositories for consistency and streamlined maintenance.
>- Enhanced mocking macros to simplify mocking of move-only types.
>- Improved error messages for expectation mismatches and mock call warnings.
>- Strengthened support for default actions and cardinality inference in mock methods.

## How to Use This Page

- **Identify Your Current Version:** Use the version headings to locate your GoogleTest/GoogleMock release.
- **Understand New Features:** Quickly grasp what new functionality has been added.
- **Prepare for Upgrades:** Spot any deprecations or breaking changes (detailed in the upgrade guide) related to your version.
- **Leverage Improvements:** Look for performance boosts or bug fixes that could enhance your testing or mock behavior.

<Tip>
If you're upgrading from an older version, start by reviewing the latest release highlights first, then scan backward to catch any cumulative changes that may impact your code.

## Tips for Maintaining Your Tests With New Versions

- **Check Compatibility:** Verify that your environment meets the minimum C++ standard and platform support for the new version.
- **Mock Behavior Changes:** Pay special attention to updates in mocking behavior modifiers (`EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL`, `RetiresOnSaturation()`, etc.), as they affect test outcomes.
- **Leverage New Matchers and Actions:** Use added built-in matchers and actions to write more expressive and maintainable tests.
- **Monitor Warnings and Errors:** Newer versions may include better diagnostics for uninteresting or unexpected calls; use these to improve test stability.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues in Upgrades

- Unexpected mock function calls occurring due to changes in default behaviors.
- Adjusting tests for new inferred cardinality rules when using `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()`.
- Addressing C++17 code standard requirements in your build system.

## Final Notes

This history serves as an evolving resource to acquaint users with what each release brings. It complements more detailed documentation on mocking syntax, test lifecycle, and platform support.
