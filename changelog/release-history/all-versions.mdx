# All Releases & Version Timeline

Explore a chronological timeline of past releases, each with easy-to-read notes summarizing key updates, bug fixes, and deprecations—helping you evaluate changes relevant to your project’s needs.

## Understanding the Release Timeline

This page presents a comprehensive view of all historical releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, arranged from the most recent to the earliest. It is designed to help developers and QA engineers quickly grasp what improvements, bug fixes, or breaking changes have been introduced over time and decide on upgrade paths accordingly.

GoogleTest and GoogleMock use semantic versioning where each release is identified by a version number (e.g., 1.17.0), representing major, minor, and patch updates. Releases may be categorized as major (introducing significant new features or breaking changes), minor (adding features or enhancements without breaking compatibility), and patches (bug fixes and stability improvements).

## How to Use This Timeline

- **Identify Versions**: Find the release version relevant to your project.
- **Review Highlights**: Each release summary provides key details on new features, fixes, and deprecations.
- **Plan Migration**: Use noted breaking changes and deprecations to understand migration efforts.
- **Check Security Updates**: Pay special attention to any security-related fixes in the release notes.

## Best Practices for Upgrading

- Verify your build environment meets the minimum compiler and platform requirements before upgrading.
- Run your test suites with increased verbosity mode to spot deprecated API usages early.
- Incrementally migrate mocking behaviors and assertion macros following migration guides in breaking changes documentation.
- Leverage continuous integration pipelines to detect any regressions caused by upgrading.
