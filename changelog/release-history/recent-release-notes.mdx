## What's New in the Latest Release

### Version 1.17.0 (Current Release)

Released: [Refer to the official GitHub release page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

GoogleTest 1.17.0 brings critical updates aligned with modern development practices, addressing user needs for compatibility, usability, and enhanced testing capabilities.

#### Key Highlights:

- **C++17 Minimum Requirement:**
  GoogleTest 1.17.0 enforces C++17 as the minimum standard for building and running tests. This upgrade ensures that users benefit from modern language features, improved compiler optimizations, and better long-term support.

- **Integrated GoogleMock and GoogleTest:**
  The framework continues to unify GoogleMock and GoogleTest repositories into a single project for seamless mocking and testing experience.

- **Expanded Test Execution Options:**
  Enhanced support for running tests individually, in sequences, or in parallel to optimize rapid feedback cycles.

- **Improved Stability and Compatibility:**
  Updates to build scripts and configurations to work reliably across supported platforms following Google’s foundational C++ support policy.

#### Important Note for Upgraders

- Ensure your build environment supports C++17 or newer. This change might require updating your compiler or build toolchain to a compliant version.

- Review any custom build flags or macros related to previous GoogleTest versions, especially those involving thread safety or macro definitions, as modern defaults may affect behavior.

- If you embed GoogleTest sources into your project, verify that the source code syncs with version 1.17.0 to avoid incompatibilities.

- For users building GoogleTest as shared or static libraries, recheck build configurations for dynamic runtime linkage settings on Windows platforms, as CMake options might have changed.

## Fixed Issues

- Resolved various stability issues related to cross-platform compatibility.

- Addressed quirks in macro naming collisions by refining macro renaming options.

- Fixes in CMake and build scripts to better handle multi-threaded tests and integration with external build systems.

## Upgrade Recommendations

1. **Validate your environment:** Confirm that your compiler and tools fully support C++17.

2. **Update build configurations:** Align your project’s CMake or other build system scripts with the 1.17.0 requirements.

3. **Test incrementally:** Before rolling out across large codebases, run updated test suites to verify test discovery and assertion behavior remain consistent.

4. **Consult breaking changes and upgrade guides:** See the [Breaking Changes & Major Migrations](https://your-doc-url/changelog/migration-upgrade-guides/breaking-changes) page for detailed migration steps.

5. **Review deprecated features:** Check the [Deprecations & Sunset Policies](https://your-doc-url/changelog/migration-upgrade-guides/deprecation-notices) to adapt your tests accordingly.
