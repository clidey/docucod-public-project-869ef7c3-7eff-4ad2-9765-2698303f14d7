# What’s New in GoogleTest

This page offers you a concise yet authoritative overview of the latest features, enhancements, and notable changes introduced in recent versions of GoogleTest. Whether you’re returning after some time away or upgrading to the newest release, here is your starting point to quickly grasp what’s improved and how it benefits your testing workflows.

## Highlights of Recent Versions

### Streamlined C++17 Requirement
- GoogleTest now requires at least **C++17** to build and run. This ensures modern language features are leveraged for improved performance, clarity, and maintenance.
- This update means you should confirm your build environment supports C++17 or newer before upgrading.

### Unified GoogleTest and GoogleMock
- The repository officially maintains GoogleTest and GoogleMock together, simplifying project integration and version management.
- This consolidation eases writing unit and mock tests side-by-side, ensuring seamless interoperability.

### Enhanced Compiler and Platform Support
- The build system has been overhauled to better detect and adjust compiler flags for MSVC, Clang, GCC, IntelLLVM, and more.
- Default compiler flags now prefer stricter warnings and correct the use of static or dynamic runtime libraries, improving build correctness and diagnostics.
- Pthreads support is automatically detected and utilized where available to enable thread-safe test execution.

### Improved Build and Integration Experience
- The CMake build scripts are updated to offer clearer, more flexible options:
  - You can build GoogleTest as a **shared** or **static** library with appropriate compile definitions.
  - The standard target aliases simplify linking (`GTest::gtest`, `GTest::gmock`, etc.).
  - Support for Ninja, Visual Studio, or Xcode generators is improved.
- Installation steps for standalone or embedded usage in other projects are documented and straightforward.

### Better Support for Multithreading and Synchronization
- When pthreads are available, GoogleTest’s internal threading primitives (mutexes, thread local) are enabled for thread-safe test execution.
- On Windows platforms without pthreads, native synchronization primitives are used.

### More Robust Logging and Error Reporting
- Platform-appropriate logging macros enable clear severity-level messages.
- Stack trace and failure reporting improvements ensure test failure diagnostics include precise source locations.

### Notable API and Usage Guidelines
- The recommended approach is to link with `gtest_main` for default `main()` implementation.
- Users can customize behavior through well-documented CMake options or compiler macros.

## Practical Tips for Upgrading

- **Verify C++ standard support**: Your compiler and build system must target at least C++17.
- **Check build flags**: Adjust your project’s C++ and linker flags if you previously used older defaults.
- **Shared vs Static**: If switching from static to shared library builds, ensure your targets are linked with `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` defined.
- **Test Locally First**: Run your entire test suite locally after upgrade to catch any environment or compatibility issues early.
- **Consult Issue Tracker**: Check the official GitHub issues for any known problems related to your compiler or platform.
