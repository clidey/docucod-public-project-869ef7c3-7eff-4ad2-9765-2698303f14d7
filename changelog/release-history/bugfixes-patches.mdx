# Bug Fixes & Patches

This page details recent bug fixes, patches, and stability improvements specifically addressing GoogleTest’s core functionality. It helps maintainers and users stay informed about resolved issues, strengthening confidence in the testing framework’s reliability. Whether you’re troubleshooting test failures or ensuring compatibility, these notes provide crucial insight into the ongoing maintenance of GoogleTest.

---

### 1. Reliability and Correctness Updates

- **Fixed Inaccurate Test Part Result Handling:**
  - Corrected behavior of `TestPartResult` related to message summary extraction, ensuring that stack traces are properly excluded from summaries.
  - Enhanced consistency of TestPartResult accessors like `file_name()`, `line_number()`, and `message()`, avoiding null pointer dereferences and improving error messaging.

- **Assertions Reporting Improvements:**
  - Resolved edge cases in `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` macros to correctly intercept and report failures originating from both current and other threads.
  - Enhanced correctness of the streaming reporter (`ScopedFakeTestPartResultReporter`) that captures test failures, supporting reliable test utilities and failure verification.

- **Test Lifecycle Stability:**
  - Improved handling of fatal and non-fatal failures during test fixture construction and teardown to prevent unexpected test continuation or premature aborts.
  - Fixed scenarios where mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` within the same test suite incorrectly passed, enforcing stricter fixture consistency.

### 2. Event Handling and Listener Fixes

- Ensured that event listeners in GoogleTest, including the default text and XML printers, correctly forward events and avoid recursive failures.
- Fixed ordering of listener event notifications for start and end events, maintaining sequence integrity.

### 3. Environment and Property Recording

- Addressed issues with property recording during test execution and global setup/teardown phases:
  - Prevented collision with reserved XML attribute names when logging custom test properties.
  - Improved thread-safe recording of properties, reducing race conditions and ensuring the proper attribution of properties to tests or test suites.

### 4. Command Line Flag Parsing and Behavior

- Fixed robustness issues in parsing GoogleTest flags, handling cases like repeated flags, flags without values, and unrecognized flag scenarios gracefully.
- Added validation and clearer error messaging for invalid flag values such as sharding environment variables and filter patterns.
- Enhanced support for help message printing triggered by unrecognized flags or `--help` argument.

### 5. Output Management and Reporting

- Fixed encoding issues for failure messages containing special characters, improving readability and accurate escape sequences in both console and XML/JSON output.
- Improved Unicode handling and UTF-8 conversions in failure messages and test name outputs.
- Enhanced consistency of XML and JSON report generation including correct inclusion of durations, timestamps, and property attributes.

### 6. Test Sharding and Parallel Execution

- Resolved bugs affecting test sharding:
  - Correct enforcement of shard boundaries, ensuring tests run only on assigned shards.
  - Proper creation and cleanup of shard status files for integration with external test runners.

### 7. Security and Maintenance Notes

- The use of `GTEST_FLAG_SET` and related flag-setting routines have been tightened to prevent incorrect state mutations.
- General code sanitization excluding deprecated APIs and reinforcing portability patches across supported platforms.

---

### Practical Impact for Users

- Tests relying on strict fixture consistency or complex failure intercept mechanisms can now depend on more reliable detection and reporting.
- The flag parsing robustness improvement allows smoother test execution in complex CI/CD environments.
- Disabled and skipped tests are more reliably identified and reported, supporting better test lifecycle control.
- Custom property recording now avoids conflicts, enabling safer extensions to test metadata.

---

### Example: Using EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE for Testing Failure

```cpp
#include "gtest/gtest-spi.h"

TEST(ExpectFatalFailureExample, DetectsFailure) {
  EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(
      { ASSERT_EQ(1, 2); },
      "Expected equality of these values");
}
```

This verifies that the assertion fails as expected, critical for utility and extension testing.

---

### Troubleshooting Common Patch-Related Issues

- Ensure your test suites do not mix `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros to avoid failures.
- Watch for changes in reserved test property keys when using `RecordProperty()`.
- When sharding tests, confirm shard environment variables are correctly set to prevent test skipping.
