# Bug Fixes & Stability Updates

The "Bug Fixes & Stability Updates" page provides a categorized and detailed summary of resolved issues, minor patches, and reliability improvements that enhance GoogleTest's robustness. This page focuses on changes that affect user workflows directly by addressing bugs or improving framework stability without introducing new features.

## Overview

This section helps users understand the improvements that ensure smoother, more predictable test execution. It includes bug fixes that prevent unexpected assertion failures, improve accuracy in failure reporting, and enhance concurrency handling in multithreaded test scenarios.

## Key Fixes and Improvements

### Improved Handling of Assertion Failures

- Fatal and non-fatal failures in subroutines are now caught more reliably, avoiding situations where tests prematurely abort or continue incorrectly after assertion failures.
- Parameterized test failures print their specific parameter values clearly in failure summaries. This makes debugging easier by directly pointing to problematic inputs.
- Usage of `SCOPED_TRACE` has been stabilized across nested and concurrent scenarios, ensuring trace messages accurately map to the relevant failure points even across threads.

### Enhanced Stability in Concurrent Tests

- In threadsafe builds, scoped traces (`SCOPED_TRACE`) properly isolate failure messages to the correct thread.
- Test part result reporters now effectively intercept and report failures originating both from the current thread and other concurrently running threads if configured accordingly.

### Crash and Error Prevention

- Fixes address mistaken mixes between `TEST` and `TEST_F` usage within the same test suite that previously led to confusing results or silent test skips.
- Disabled tests and test suites prefixed with `DISABLED_` now reliably prevent test execution and associated setup/teardown methods from running.
- Tests failing due to mixing typed and untyped tests within the same test case produce clear failure messages.

### Improved Reporting and Property Recording

- Test properties recorded with reserved keys such as "name", "file", "time", etc., are now flagged as errors to prevent conflicts in generated XML and JSON reports.
- The test result XML and JSON output formats have been stabilized to reflect accurate failure counts, timing, and test suite properties.

## Example Scenarios

### Catching Fatal Failures in Helper Functions

If you have assertions inside helper functions (subroutines), GoogleTest now ensures that fatal failures cause the current test to abort early. Users can also use `HasFatalFailure()` to check for failures inside sub-methods and act accordingly.

```cpp
void Subroutine() {
  ASSERT_EQ(1, 2);  // Fatal failure.
  // Further code won't execute if fatal failure occurs.
}

TEST(FooTest, Bar) {
  Subroutine();
  if (HasFatalFailure()) return; // Abort test early on failure.
  // Continue with test only if Subroutine succeeded.
}
```

### Interleaving Logs with Assertions

Interleaving test logs and assertions with proper message traces is robust under concurrency.

```cpp
TEST(LoggingTest, ConcurrentTraces) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("Outer scope trace");
  // Log and assertions inside concurrent threads record correct trace points.
  // GoogleTest ensures these traces are properly segregated per thread.
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` liberally in complex tests, especially inside loops and nested function calls, to maintain context for failures.
- Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros within the same test suite to prevent runtime errors.
- Record custom properties with unique keys when needed, avoiding reserved key names to prevent reporting conflicts.
- For concurrent test cases, ensure thread safety flags and scoped trace usage are consistent to maintain accurate reporting.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If a failure message lacks parameter details in a parameterized test, check that your test suite is properly instantiated and parameterized.
- Unexpected execution of disabled tests indicates misnaming; confirm the `DISABLED_` prefix on test names or suites.
- Tests seeming to hang or crash when multiple threads are involved might benefit from setting death test style to "threadsafe" for safer forking.
