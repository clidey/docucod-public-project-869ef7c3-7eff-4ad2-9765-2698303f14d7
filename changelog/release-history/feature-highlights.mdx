# Feature Highlights by Release

This page presents the most important new features, improvements, and optimizations introduced in each GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. Users can explore release-specific advancements to maximize the benefits of upgrading their testing framework.

---

## Latest Major Releases

### Version 1.17.0
**Release Date:** Recent

- **Minimum C++ Standard Requirement Increased:** The 1.17.x branch now requires at least C++17 support, enabling modern language features and improved compiler optimizations.
- **Documentation Published on GitHub Pages:** Users are encouraged to browse the detailed and updated documentation on https://google.github.io/googletest/ for easier navigation and updated content.
- **Dependency Update Planned:** Future releases will introduce a dependency on the [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) common libraries to streamline internal code reuse.

### Version 1.16.x and Earlier
- Continued refinements of core GoogleTest functionality including better support for death tests, parameterized tests, and typed tests.
- Expansions of GoogleMock capabilities to cover more mocking scenarios, including improved handling of move-only types and richer matchers and actions.
- Enhanced platform and compiler support, ensuring compatibility with a wide variety of environments.

## Key Feature Highlights by Release

### Mocking Enhancements

- Introduction of the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro replacing the older family of `MOCK_METHODn` macros, simplifying mock method declarations.
- Support for mocking template classes and overloaded methods with clear syntax.
- Ability to specify method qualifiers like `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, and calling conventions such as `Calltype(STDMETHODCALLTYPE)`.
- New wrappers like `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` allow control over warnings and error reporting on uninteresting calls, improving test flexibility and robustness.

### Expectation and Action Control

- Flexible options for setting expectations and call cardinalities with `EXPECT_CALL` including `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, `.InSequence()`, and `.After()` clauses.
- `ON_CALL` provides a mechanism to specify default actions without setting expectations, ideal for less strict test setups.
- The introduction of multi-argument `.With()` clause to enforce constraints across all arguments as one tuple.
- Support for delegating calls to fakes or real implementations from within mocks, enabling hybrid test behaviors.

### Matchers and Customization

- Extended matcher framework supporting composite matchers, polymorphic matchers, and custom user-defined matchers via `MATCHER` macros and classes.
- Support for matching STL containers, validating object members (`Field`, `Property`), and pointers (`Pointee`, `NotNull`).
- Actions allowing complex side effects, chaining (`DoAll`), argument saving (`SaveArg`), and invoking callable parameters.

### Test Execution and Reporting

- Improved command-line flags to control verbosity of mock diagnostics (`--gmock_verbose`) and catch leaked mocks.
- Optimizations in test fixture setup and teardown cycles, improving test isolation and speed.
- Enhanced test discovery and registration mechanism supporting type-parameterized and value-parameterized tests for maximum reuse.

### Performance and Scalability

- Guidance on compiling mocks efficiently by moving constructor and destructor definitions out of headers.
- Support for parallel test execution and sharding for large test suites, improving continuous integration throughput.

---

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- Use `ON_CALL` by default to set default behaviors without expecting calls, while reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for strict verifications.
- Define mocks in places owned by the interface maintainers to reduce maintenance burden.
- Prefer `NiceMock` for less noisy testing, `StrictMock` only when test brittleness is acceptable to enforce strict contract adherence.
- Always set expectations before exercising mocks to avoid undefined behavior.
- Use sequences and partial ordering (`InSequence`, `.After()`) to validate call order precisely when needed.

---

## Troubleshooting and Migration

- When migrating from older `MOCK_METHODn` macros, switch to the unified `MOCK_METHOD` syntax.
- Adjust tests to account for the new minimum C++17 requirement.
- Review usages of uninteresting calls and apply `NiceMock` or `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress unwanted warnings.
- Leverage new release documentation and migration notes available on the official [GoogleTest documentation site](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
