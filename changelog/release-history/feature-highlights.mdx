# Major Features & Improvements

Explore the most impactful enhancements and critical features introduced in recent GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. This narrative-driven summary is designed to keep you efficient, productive, and compatible with today's C++ testing needs.

---

## 1. Advanced Parameterized Test Support

GoogleTest continues to expand its robust framework for **value-parameterized**, **typed**, and **type-parameterized tests**, helping you write concise, maintainable tests that cover a broad range of inputs and types without duplication.

- **TEST_P and INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P:** Create flexible value-parameterized tests and instantiate them with various parameter generators like `Values`, `Range`, and `Combine` for Cartesian product testing.
  
- **Typed Tests:** Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` to run tests across multiple types efficiently.

- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Define abstract test patterns with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and instantiate them later with specific type lists using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

- **Custom Test Names:** Generate meaningful test names for parameterized tests with user-defined `name_generator` functions, improving test output readability.

These features empower you to systematically cover edge cases and interface implementations by running the same test logic across diverse inputs and types.

## 2. Rich Assertions and Matchers Ecosystem

Improved assertions and integration with GoogleMock’s matcher framework allow you to express precise test intentions and generate detailed diagnostics.

- **New Assertion Macros:** Expanded support for predicate assertions (`EXPECT_PRED*`), predicate-formatter assertions (`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`), and `EXPECT_THAT` to verify complex conditions with elegant syntax.

- **Enhanced Matcher Support:** Hundreds of built-in matchers plus the ability to compose, combine, and create **custom matchers** with the `MATCHER` macros provide expressive matching of values, containers, pointers, and even complex objects.

- **Floating-Point and String Assertions:** Specialized macros like `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, and string matchers enable precise comparison tolerant of rounding errors or flexible string matching.

- **Exception and Death Assertions:** Better support for verifying exceptions and process termination, including death tests with controlled styles (`fast`, `threadsafe`).

## 3. Improved Mocking Features and Behavior Control

GoogleMock brings enhanced productivity and control to your test doubles.

- **MOCK_METHOD Enhancements:** Simplified macro with support for mocking const, noexcept, overloaded, and template methods.

- **Strictness Modes:** Introduced and improved support for `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and `NaggyMock` to balance test noise and strictness regarding uninteresting or unexpected calls.

- **Delegation Patterns:** Easily delegate mock calls to fakes or real implementations while retaining verification abilities.

- **Advanced Actions and Expectations:** Enhanced capabilities including variadic actions, parameterized actions, and action chaining with `DoAll()` allow rich, scenario-specific mock behaviors.

- **Support for Move-Only Types:** Native support for methods accepting and returning move-only types (`std::unique_ptr`), enabling natural mocking in modern C++ code.

- **MockFunction for std::function:** Mock `std::function` objects to test callbacks and function objects seamlessly.

## 4. Test Discovery, Execution, and Event Listening

- **Dynamic Test Registration:** Support for `RegisterTest` enables flexible test registration at runtime.

- **Event Listener API:** Customize test reporting by extending or replacing default listeners for console or XML output.

- **Fine-Grained Test Control:** New flags and environment variables allow filtering tests, sharding execution across machines, repeating or shuffling tests, and controlling output verbosity.

## 5. Integration and Platform Support Enhancements

- **Supported Platforms:** Continual updates to supported compilers, OSes, and environment standards, including mandatory C++17 support.

- **Build System Integration:** Improved workflows for CMake and Bazel, including `gtest_main` linking and testing rules.

- **Sanitizer and Thread Safety:** Enhanced integration with sanitizers and improved thread safety features relevant to death tests.

## Practical Examples

```cpp
// Parameterized test example
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesVariousValues) {
    int param = GetParam();
    EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveNumbers, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

```cpp
// Mocking an interface with delegation
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int DoSomething(int x) = 0;
};

class FakeFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  int DoSomething(int x) override { return x * 2; }
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, DoSomething, (int), (override));

  void DelegateToFake() {
    ON_CALL(*this, DoSomething).WillByDefault([this](int x) {
      return fake_.DoSomething(x);
    });
  }

 private:
  FakeFoo fake_;
};
```

```cpp
// Custom matcher example
MATCHER(IsEven, "Checks if number is even") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

TEST(ExampleTest, EvenCheck) {
  EXPECT_THAT(4, IsEven());
  EXPECT_THAT(5, Not(IsEven()));
}
```

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent compilation issues.
- Use `ASSERT_*` for fatal failures where subsequent code depends on the assertion's success.
- Use `EXPECT_*` to allow tests to continue and collect multiple failures.
- Carefully manage setup and teardown through constructors and `SetUp()/TearDown()` to ensure robust test isolation.
- When using death tests, name test suites with a `*DeathTest` suffix to ensure correct ordering.

For more detailed guidance, see the [GoogleTest FAQ](docs/faq.md) and [Advanced Topics](docs/advanced.md).
