## Release Cadence and Schedule

GoogleTest follows a flexible but predictable release schedule, focusing on quality and stability:

- **Major releases** approximately every 6-12 months introduce new features and API improvements.
- **Minor releases** provide incremental enhancements and new capabilities.
- **Patch releases** address critical bugs and security fixes as needed.

Regular snapshots or pre-release builds may be available for early adopters, but official production use is advised only on stable releases.


## Significant Milestones & Integration Notes

| Version  | Key Changes Impacting Integration                   | Migration or Upgrade Notes                         |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1.17.0   | Improved C++17 support; stricter mock verification and enhanced verbose logging; better CMake integration | Minimal migration needed, review warnings for deprecated behaviors.
| 1.16.0   | Introduced new mocking actions; added explicit handling for order-sensitive expectations | Review updated `EXPECT_CALL` semantics for order enforcement.
| 1.15.0   | Matchers API refinement; memory management fixes in mock objects                          | Test code should verify no longer uses deprecated matcher forms.

## Troubleshooting: Common Version Upgrade Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues When Upgrading Versions">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors After Upgrading">
Causes:
- Incompatibilities with updated compiler flags or C++ standard requirements.
- Updated method signatures or matcher APIs.

Solutions:
- Verify your build system uses C++17 or higher.
- Refactor tests to comply with the latest EXPECT_CALL and matcher syntax.
- Refer to [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](../getting-started/prerequisites-installation-setup/system-requirements-supported-platforms) for environment guidance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linking and Runtime Failures">
Causes:
- Mixing versions of GoogleTest libraries in static vs dynamic linking.
- Inconsistent runtime library flags, especially on Windows.

Solutions:
- Ensure consistent linkage according to [Installation with CMake and Bazel](../getting-started/prerequisites-installation-setup/installation-cmake-bazel).
- Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option on Windows to align runtimes.
- See [Troubleshooting Common Installation & Build Issues](../getting-started/first-test-debugging/troubleshooting-common-issues) for detailed help.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Test Failures Due to Mock Strictness">
Causes:
- Changes in default mock behavior strictness or expectation verification.

Solutions:
- Adjust mock strictness with `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag to diagnose failing expectations.
- Consult [Mock Strictness Control](../api-reference/core-apis/gmock-nice-strict-api) documentation.

## Versioning Philosophy (Brief)

GoogleTest follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), where:

- Major versions introduce possible backward-incompatible changes.
- Minor versions add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- Patch versions fix bugs without changing APIs.

Plan upgrades accordingly to avoid surprises during dependency updates.
