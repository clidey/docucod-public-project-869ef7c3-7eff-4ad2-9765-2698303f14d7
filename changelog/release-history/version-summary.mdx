## Understanding Versioning and Impact on Your Workflow

GoogleTest follows semantic versioning principles, where:
- **Major Versions:** Include significant new features that may introduce breaking changes.
- **Minor Versions:** Add enhancements and functionality without breaking backward compatibility.
- **Patch Versions:** Focus on bug fixes and minor improvements.

The summary here highlights thresholds influencing your project workflow, such as build requirements (e.g., C++17) or altered behaviors that might require code adjustments.

## Practical Tips for Navigating Release Upgrades

- **Verify your compiler and environment compatibility before upgrading, especially regarding C++ standard support.** For example, the 1.17.x branch mandates C++17, so earlier environments must upgrade accordingly.

- **Consult linked detailed release notes** and the [Breaking Changes & Deprecations](./breaking-changes) page to plan your migration smoothly.

- Leverage [Upgrade Guides](./upgrade-guides) for step-by-step instructions to adjust existing tests or build configurations.

- Keep abreast of the official [Supported Platforms & Audience](../../overview/product-introduction/supported-platforms-and-audience) documentation to understand environment alignment.

- Use this timeline to monitor when new features align with your project needs, avoiding unnecessary upgrades when stability is preferred.
