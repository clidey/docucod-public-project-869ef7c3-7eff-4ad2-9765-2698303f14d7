# Latest Release Notes

This page provides a detailed, user-focused overview of the most recent GoogleTest release. It is an essential resource for developers planning to upgrade their testing environment immediately and looking to understand the key changes, enhancements, and urgent information impacting their workflow.

---

## 1. Overview of the Latest Release

The latest version of GoogleTest, **1.17.0**, marks a significant milestone delivering modern C++17 support and integration improvements that streamline your test development and execution experience. This release combines both GoogleTest and GoogleMock enhancements, providing a seamless upgrade path for your entire C++ testing framework.

### Key Highlights

- **C++17 Requirement:** Starting with version 1.17.x, GoogleTest requires a minimum of C++17 standard compliance. This upgrade enables harnessing modern language features, improved performance, and cleaner APIs.
- **Improved Integration with Build Systems:** Enhanced support for modern build workflows, particularly CMake, easing setup and embedding across diverse development environments.
- **Documentation Update:** GoogleTest documentation is now live on GitHub Pages, offering improved navigation and usability for quick access.

### Why Upgrade?

Upgrading to this release means embracing modern C++ standards ensuring forward compatibility and better tooling. Additionally, many internal improvements provide more robust test discovery, execution, and mocking operations in your workflow.

<Tip>
Ensure your development environment supports C++17 or higher before upgrading to version 1.17.0 to avoid build and compatibility issues.

## 2. Detailed Release Features and Improvements

### 2.1 Modern C++17 Support
- The adoption of C++17 simplifies the usage of language features across GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- This change allows users to write cleaner, more maintainable tests utilizing modern constructs.

### 2.2 Build and Installation Enhancements
- The `CMakeLists.txt` project file includes more robust configuration options to better align with various platforms and compilers.
- Options such as `BUILD_GMOCK` and `INSTALL_GTEST` facilitate flexible building scenarios, from full GoogleTest + GoogleMock to GoogleTest only.
- Support for dynamic runtime selection on Visual Studio projects via the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option improves linking compatibility.

### 2.3 Documentation and Usability
- The documentation has been restructured and migrated to [GoogleTest on GitHub Pages](https://google.github.io/googletest/), providing:
  - Search-friendly, well-organized content.
  - Easy access to key guides such as Getting Started, Mocking Basics, and Advanced Topics.
  - Clear separation between user, API reference, and conceptual documentation.

### 2.4 Community and Ecosystem
- The release continues to encourage community contributions, linking to community-created resources that enhance your GoogleTest experience.
- Maintainers plan tighter integration with the Abseil libraries for enhanced functionality in upcoming releases.

## 3. Urgent Upgrade Notes

### C++17 Adoption
- This release **does not support pre-C++17 environments**. Users must upgrade compiler toolchains accordingly before switching.
- Failure to comply will result in build failures or subtle runtime errors.

### Continuous Integration Adaptations
- GoogleTest's internal CI uses Googleâ€™s infrastructure; however, users should test their own CI pipelines post-upgrade especially if using custom or legacy build scripts.

### Build Scripts Changes
- If you integrate GoogleTest with CMake, consider revisiting your `CMakeLists.txt`:
  - `BUILD_GMOCK` defaults to ON to include GoogleMock.
  - Use `INSTALL_GTEST` to control installation behavior as per project embedding needs.

<Tip>
Before upgrading, run `cmake --version` and `clang++ --version` or `g++ --version` to verify that your toolchain supports C++17.
</Tip>

## 4. Upgrade and Migration Guidance

### Step-by-Step Upgrade Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Preparation">
Verify your build environment supports C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+).
</Step>
<Step title="Backup">
Backup existing GoogleTest code and any customizations.
</Step>
<Step title="Fetch Latest Code">
Checkout the new release tag from GitHub or download from the releases page.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Build Configuration">
Update your `CMakeLists.txt` or build scripts to align with new options like `BUILD_GMOCK`.
</Step>
<Step title="Rebuild and Test">
Rebuild the entire project and run all tests to validate upgrade success.
</Step>
<Step title="Leverage New Features">
Explore updated documentation to optimize test code using modern C++17 capabilities.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Common Pitfalls

- **C++ Standard Mismatch:** Ensure your project explicitly sets C++17 standard.
- **Linking Errors:** Using `gtest_force_shared_crt` in Visual Studio projects helps resolve runtime library conflicts.
- **Documentation References:** Rely on the new GitHub Pages docs instead of older Markdown files to avoid obsolete guidance.
