## What's New in the Latest Release

### Overview
GoogleTest and GoogleMock continue to evolve, enhancing the robustness, usability, and compatibility of the unified C++ testing framework. This latest release introduces improvements that help you write clearer, faster, and more reliable tests while ensuring broader platform support.

### Headline Features
- **Improved C++17 Compliance Requirement:** The framework now requires C++17 or later, modernizing the codebase and unlocking better language features. This change ensures better compatibility and future-proofing.

- **Enhanced Initialization of GoogleMock:** The initialization function `InitGoogleMock()` now better parses command-line flags, filtering recognized GoogleMock options and separating unrelated flags more cleanly, simplifying test execution setups.

- **Stronger Integration Between GoogleTest and GoogleMock:** The merged project improves coordination between the two components for a more seamless user experience, including unified initialization and streamlined test running.

- **Expanded Platform and Compiler Support:** Updates reflect the latest supported compiler versions and operating systems, aligning with Google's foundational C++ support policies.

### Major Bug Fixes
- Fixed inconsistencies in mock method handling on Windows, addressing prior linkage and execution glitches.
- Corrected issues causing incorrect parsing of GoogleMock flags on platforms supporting wide-character arguments, improving cross-platform usage.
- Resolved test discovery edge cases where certain tests weren't automatically registered under specific advanced filter conditions.

### Platform Support Updates
- The project now officially requires an environment with C++17 support, including compatible compilers like GCC 7+, Clang 6+, MSVC 2017+, and recent versions on macOS.
- Continuous integration setups have been enhanced for smoother builds across supported platforms.

## Using the Latest Features

### Migrating to C++17 Standard
To fully leverage the improvements and support in the latest release, ensure your build system and development environment are configured for C++17. For example, with CMake, add:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

This guarantees compatibility and access to the latest language features expected by the framework.

### Initializing GoogleMock in Your Tests
Initialization of GoogleMock remains straightforward but now gracefully handles command-line flags specific to GoogleMock by removing them from the argument list passed down to your tests.

Here's a standard example for a test executable entry point:

```cpp
#include "gmock/gmock.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

With this, GoogleMock processes its flags seamlessly, while your tests see only the arguments intended for them.

### Running Tests
Run your tests as usual. Command-line options are better handled, including GoogleMock-specific verbosity flags.

Example:

```
./my_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

You can also combine other flags that are unrelated to GoogleMock without interference.

## What Has Changed Under the Hood

While internal implementation details are abstracted away to keep this focused on user value, here are key user-relevant points:

- **Flag Parsing:** GoogleMock now strips recognized flags (`--gmock_verbose`, `--gmock_default_mock_behavior`, etc.) from `argv` in `InitGoogleMock()`, so downstream code sees a clean argument list.

- **Test Main Integration:** The `gmock_main` library provides a main function that simplifies test binary creation, ensuring proper initialization and execution order out-of-the-box.

- **Wide-character Command-line Support:** Improvements fix previous issues with wide-character argument arrays (`wchar_t** argv`) on Windows and some embedded platforms.

- **Setup on Embedded Platforms:** Special provisions exist to integrate GoogleMock with platforms like ESP32 and Arduino, initializing tests in `setup()` and running in `loop()`.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Running or Discovered
- Ensure your test files are linked correctly and compiled with the required C++17 standard.
- Verify you’ve called either `InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv)` or linked your test against `gmock_main` if relying on its main() function.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to check test discovery.

### Flag Parsing Anomalies
- Use only supported GoogleMock flags prefixed with `--gmock_`.
- Avoid custom flags conflicting with these; if necessary, parse custom flags before calling `InitGoogleMock()`.

### Linking Errors on Windows
- Confirm consistent runtime library linkage settings between your project and GoogleTest/GoogleMock.
- Use CMake options like `gtest_force_shared_crt` if dynamic runtimes are needed.

## Example: Basic Test Initialization

```cpp
#include "gmock/gmock.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

TEST(SampleTest, Example) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Run with additional verbosity for mock operations:

```
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=info
```
