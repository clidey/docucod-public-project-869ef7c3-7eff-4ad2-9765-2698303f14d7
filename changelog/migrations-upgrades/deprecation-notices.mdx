# Deprecation Notices

This page centralizes all deprecation warnings across GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. It provides clear information on APIs and features that are scheduled for removal, recommended replacements, and suggested timelines to help you update your test suites proactively.

---

## Understanding Deprecations

As GoogleTest evolves, some features and APIs become outdated, replaced by improvements that enhance usability, performance, or maintainability. Deprecation alerts serve as early warnings so you can migrate your code before these features are removed in future versions.

Deprecation notices listed here include:

- APIs and macros planned for removal.
- Recommended alternatives or replacements.
- Important timelines or version milestones for planned removal.

Staying informed of deprecations ensures your test code remains compatible, secure, and takes full advantage of GoogleTest's ongoing enhancements.

## Commonly Deprecated Features

While GoogleTest maintains a strong backward compatibility commitment, frequent deprecations fall into the following categories:

### Mocking Macros Migration

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have unified mocking macros under the newer `MOCK_METHOD` macro, replacing the older `MOCK_METHODn` family. This change simplifies mock method definitions and supports modern C++ features such as move-only types.

**What to do:**

- Replace `MOCK_METHOD0`, `MOCK_METHOD1`, ..., `MOCK_CONST_METHODn` macros with `MOCK_METHOD` calls.
- Use the fourth parameter of `MOCK_METHOD` to specify qualifiers like `const` or `override` as needed.

Example:
```cpp
// Old style
MOCK_CONST_METHOD1(DoSomething, bool(int));

// New recommended style
MOCK_METHOD(bool, DoSomething, (int), (const, override));
```

### Mock Strictness Classes

Usage of `NaggyMock` is deprecated in favor of explicit choice between `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` to better manage uninteresting calls.

**What to do:**

- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock<T>` to turn uninteresting calls into test failures.

### Deprecated Flags and Naming Conventions

Some flags and naming conventions for test suites or death tests have been updated or replaced to align with new standards.

**What to do:**

- Adapt test suite and test names as recommended in migration notes.
- Review any usage of deprecated flags and replace with current equivalents.

## Migration Recommendations and Timelines

- **Immediate Action:** Begin refactoring code that uses deprecated mocking macros to the new `MOCK_METHOD` macro format. This avoids compatibility issues with the latest compilers and improves test clarity.

- **Medium Term:** Stop using `NaggyMock` and switch to `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` based on test strictness preferences.

- **Long Term:** Monitor future release notes for any removals of deprecated features and plan upgrades accordingly.

*Consult the Breaking Changes & Migration Notes page for detailed step-by-step migration instructions.*

## Practical Tips for Handling Deprecations

- **Regularly Review Release Notes:** Each release highlights new deprecations.
- **Use Compiler Warnings:** Enabling warnings for deprecated features helps identify affected code.
- **Refactor Incrementally:** Prioritize critical test paths first.
- **Test Thoroughly:** After migration, run your full test suite to catch regressions.
- **Leverage Community Support:** Consult related documentation or community forums for migration assistance.

## Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues

If you encounter build errors or unexpected test failures related to deprecated features:

- Check that your build environment meets the minimum compiler version requirements supporting C++17.
- Verify that `MOCK_METHOD` macros are correctly used, especially with complex argument types.
- Review the presence of any deprecated `NaggyMock` usages and update accordingly.
- Ensure no conflicting macro definitions or mixed usage of legacy and new mocking styles.

For persistent issues, refer to the Troubleshooting & Common Issues guide and the Mocking Reference documentation.
