# Deprecations

The **Deprecations** page provides a clear and actionable overview of deprecated features, APIs, and support policies within GoogleTest. It ensures that users are well-informed about upcoming removals and timelines, empowering them to proactively update their tests and migrate code before deprecated elements are discontinued.

---

## Understanding Deprecations

Deprecated features or APIs are no longer recommended for use and will be removed in future releases. This page lists all such elements, explains the timelines for their removal, and provides recommended alternatives to help you transition smoothly.

By staying informed through this page, you can avoid unexpected test failures or incompatibilities caused by removed features. Proactively adapting your code keeps your test suites stable and maintainable.

---

## What’s Listed Here

- **Deprecated Features:** Includes APIs, macros, flags, or behaviors that are planned for removal.
- **Timeline for Removal:** Specifies in which upcoming version the feature will be removed.
- **Recommended Alternatives:** Suggests modern or supported features to replace deprecated ones.

Each deprecation is accompanied by clear guidance to help you understand the impact and what steps to take next.

---

## Why This Matters

Deprecation notices allow you to plan ahead by:

- Preventing surprises from sudden removals
- Ensuring your tests remain compatible with the latest versions
- Taking advantage of improvements and better practices through recommended alternatives

Ignoring deprecations may cause your tests to break or exhibit undefined behavior when upgrading GoogleTest.

---

## Typical User Workflow

1. **Review Deprecations:** Regularly check this page when upgrading or planning upgrades.
2. **Identify Affected Tests:** Search your codebase for use of deprecated features.
3. **Evaluate Alternatives:** Learn about the recommended replacements or new patterns.
4. **Plan Migration:** Schedule updates and refactors using migration guides linked from deprecation entries.
5. **Validate:** After changes, run your test suite to confirm functionality.

---

## Practical Tips

- Always back up your current test code before starting migration.
- Use automated tools or scripts if available to detect deprecated usage.
- Gradually refactor tests rather than all at once to minimize risk.
- Stay connected to community channels to learn about deprecations.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Deprecated Warnings:** Deprecation warnings are early signals. Neglecting them leads to bigger problems during upgrades.
- **Delaying Migration:** The longer you wait, the more difficult the migration becomes as dependent code accumulates.
- **Missing Alternatives:** Sometimes deprecated features have direct replacements, other times, you need to adapt design patterns. Understand the recommended alternative fully.

## Example Deprecation Entry

```markdown
### MOCK_METHODn Macros Deprecated

- **Deprecated In:** Version 1.11.0
- **Removed In:** Version 1.13.0 (planned)

The old `MOCK_METHODn` macros (e.g., `MOCK_METHOD1`, `MOCK_CONST_METHOD3`) are deprecated in favor of the new generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

**Recommended Alternative:**
Use:

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(ReturnType, MethodName, (Args...), (qualifiers));
```

Instead of:

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD1(MethodName, ReturnType(Args));
```

Refer to the [Mock Class and Method API](../api-reference/googlemock-api/mock-class-and-method-api.md#MOCK_METHOD) for full usage.
```

## Migration Assistance

For each deprecated item, you will find links to detailed migration instructions and examples where available. Follow these to ensure correctness.

---

## Stay Updated

GoogleTest’s changelog and the Breaking Changes document complement this page by providing detailed upgrade guidance and context for deprecations.

Regularly consult the following:

- [Breaking Changes](../changelog/migrations-upgrades/breaking-changes.md)
- [Upgrade Guide](../changelog/migrations-upgrades/upgrade-guide.md)
- Latest Release Notes

---

## Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues

If after migrating you face unexpected test failures:

- Verify you have removed all deprecated features.
- Check for updates in the migration guide.
- Consult the [FAQ](../../faq/general-usage-faq/basic-getting-started-help.md) or community support channels.

---

## Summary
The **Deprecations** page intentionally focuses on your codebase impact — what to change, when, and how — freeing you from guessing internal library details. This ensures smooth, confident adoption of modern GoogleTest features.
