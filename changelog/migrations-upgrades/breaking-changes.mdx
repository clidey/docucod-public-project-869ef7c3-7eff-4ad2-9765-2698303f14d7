# Breaking Changes Overview

The **Breaking Changes Overview** page catalogues all changes in GoogleTest that may impact backward compatibility. This resource is essential for teams anticipating an upgrade, as it highlights API modifications, platform requirements, and behavior differences that could affect existing test suites. For each breaking change, actionable guidance is provided to help you smoothly adapt and maintain continuity in your testing workflows.

## Understanding Breaking Changes

Upgrading to a newer GoogleTest version can bring performance, reliability, and security improvements. However, any breaking changes—alterations that may cause existing tests or integrations to fail—require careful attention. This page serves as your centralized catalog to identify such changes, understand their impact, and navigate migration steps.

### What Constitutes a Breaking Change?

- **API Modifications:** Changes to function signatures, method availability, or default behaviors in GoogleTest or GoogleMock APIs.
- **Platform and Language Requirements:** Minimum supported C++ standards or platform drops that might necessitate recompilation or environment updates.
- **Behavioral Differences:** Changes in assertion handling, test discovery, mocking semantics, or execution flows.

Recognizing and addressing these prevents test regressions and integration errors.

## Overview of Notable Breaking Changes

We organize breaking changes into targeted categories for clear understanding:

### 1. API Signature and Behavior Updates

- Changes to macros like `MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`, and `ON_CALL` requiring updated syntax or qualifiers.
- Updates in matchers or actions that affect how expectations and behaviors are specified.
- Adjustments in handling overloaded or templated mock methods.

### 2. Platform and Compiler Requirements

- Introduction of mandatory **C++17** language standard support starting with version 1.17.x.
- Deprecation of support for older MSVC versions or non-modern compilers.

### 3. Framework Initialization and Execution

- Modifications in initialization functions such as `InitGoogleTest` and `InitGoogleMock`.
- Changes in test discovery mechanisms affecting how tests are registered and run.

### 4. Mocking Behavior Changes

- Default strictness transitions in mocks (e.g., default to NaggyMock behavior).
- Changes in handling uninteresting and unexpected calls, including warnings vs failures.
- Alterations in usage patterns for `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and `NaggyMock`.

## How to Adapt: Practical Guidance

For each breaking change, you will find clear migration advice focused on user outcomes:

- **Code-Level Updates:** Step-by-step instructions to alter mock classes, test cases, or configurations.
- **Build and Environment:** Guidance to update compilers, build systems (e.g., CMake), and platform targets.
- **Behavioral Adjustments:** Recommendations to revise test expectations, mocking strictness, or assertion styles.

This progressive approach supports a gradual migration without disrupting your testing pipelines.

## Best Practices When Facing Breaking Changes

- **Incremental Upgrades:** Upgrade one major version at a time and validate test stability.
- **Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` Explicitly:** Control mock strictness to reduce unexpected warnings or failures.
- **Review `EXPECT_CALL` Usages:** Ensure expectations match updated API and semantic rules.
- **Leverage Verbosity Flags:** Use `--gmock_verbose` to diagnose test failures during adaptation.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- Ignoring mandatory C++17 support may lead to compilation failures.
- Retaining deprecated mocking macros or signatures causes build and run-time errors.
- Over-specifying expectations can cause brittle tests; prefer `ON_CALL` for default behavior where verification isn't needed.

Refer to troubleshooting sections in [Mocking API Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.md) and [Diagnosing Test Failures](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/advanced-troubleshooting/test-failures-diagnostics.html) for help.

## Illustrative User Flow: Navigating a Breaking Change

1. **Identify** the breaking change affecting your tests (e.g., `MOCK_METHOD` macro updated to require explicit qualifiers).
2. **Locate** all mock classes using the affected pattern.
3. **Apply** updated syntax, ensuring parentheses around complex types and appropriate use of `(override)`.
4. **Verify** compilation passes and tests execute with expected outcomes.
5. **Adjust** mocking strictness using `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` to manage warnings.
6. **Consult** related migration guides and API references for complex cases.
