# Previous Releases Changelog Archive

This documentation page maintains a comprehensive, chronological archive of earlier releases of GoogleMock. It serves users and maintainers who need to track historical changes, understand past enhancements, or manage dependency upgrades responsibly.

---

## Understanding the Archive

This page is dedicated exclusively to documenting previous version releases of GoogleMock—focusing on core improvements, fixed issues, and incremental updates introduced over time. It complements the [Latest Release](./latest-release) and detailed changelogs in the product.

If you are maintaining a project that depends on GoogleMock or needing to audit changes between upgrades, this page offers authoritative insight into the framework’s evolution.

## How to Use This Archive

### Tracking Upgrades Between Versions

- Review release dates in reverse chronological order to see the most recent prior updates first.
- Identify new features, bug fixes, and behavior changes that might affect your tests.
- Note any breaking changes or deprecated functionality for migration planning.

### Managing Dependencies

- Understand improvements in mocking syntax or API that may allow for simplified mocks.
- Detect fixes for edge-case behaviors that impact your test reliability.

### Auditing Iterative Improvements

- Track the evolution of mock method semantics, expectation handling, and default actions.
- Observe refinements in call ordering constraints and sequence handling.
- Understand added support for advanced features like proper handling of move-only types.

## Key Notable Historical Enhancements

### Introduction of MOCK_METHOD Macro

- Transition from older `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the newer, more flexible `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Enabled mocking of methods with qualifiers such as `const`, `noexcept`, and call types.
- Improved syntax for mocking overloaded methods and methods with complex argument types.

### Expectation Syntax and Semantics Refinement

- Enforced syntax and order rules for clauses on `EXPECT_CALL` such as `With()`, `Times()`, `InSequence()`, `After()`, `WillOnce()`, and `WillRepeatedly()`.
- Added mechanisms to infer call cardinalities based on the presence of `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` clauses.
- Introduced `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for managing expectation lifetimes.

### Advanced Call Ordering

- Support for partial order using multiple sequences for expectations.
- Flexibility in expressing complex call order DAGs for scheduling mock method calls.

### Default Actions and ON_CALL

- Clarified the role of default actions for uninteresting and unexpected calls.
- Improvements in default action specification using `ON_CALL` and ability to set multiple default behaviors prioritized by last match.

### Mock Object Behaviors: Nice, Naggy, and Strict

- Addition of `NiceMock` to silence warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock` behavior as default, providing warnings.
- `StrictMock` to treat uninteresting calls as errors, supporting stricter test validation.

### Move-Only Type Support

- Added explicit support for mocking methods with move-only arguments like `std::unique_ptr`.
- Guidance for workarounds in legacy code via method delegation.

### Verification and Reset Enhancements

- New methods to verify and clear expectations and default actions on mocks (`Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations` and `Mock::VerifyAndClear`).
- Support for re-verifying and re-clearing mocks in test workflows.

### Verbosity and Diagnostic Improvements

- Introduction of the `--gmock_verbose` flag with levels `info`, `warning` (default), and `error` to control logging.
- Enhanced output messages for uninteresting calls, unexpected calls, and exhausted expectations with scenarios including argument and return value printing and stack traces.

### Robustness and Thread Safety

- Improvements to make calling mock methods and their actions thread-safe.
- Better lock management to avoid deadlock when actions call back into mocks.

### Deletion and Lifecycle Handling

- Patterns and tests for safe deletion of mocks during actions, including deleting self inside an action.

## Example of Common Changes Per Release

```text
Version 1.10.0 (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Added RetiresOnSaturation() clause to EXPECT_CALL.
- Refined ON_CALL syntax to enforce WillByDefault clause.
- Introduced DefaultValue<T> for managing default returns.

Version 1.9.0 (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Enabled mocking of methods with noexcept qualifiers.
- Improved error messages with file location for exhausted actions.
- Added support for move-only types in MOCK_METHOD.

Version 1.8.1 (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Fixed warnings on excessive WillOnce actions.
- Improved intricacies of InSequence and After usage.
- Stabilized Mock object verification and clearing.
```

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices Highlights

- Always define `EXPECT_CALL` statements before mock method calls, to avoid undefined behavior.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations once saturated and avoid confusing sticky expectations.
- When mocking overloaded methods, use `Const()` to disambiguate const overloads.
- Use `NiceMock` when you want to suppress warnings from uninteresting method calls to reduce noise during development.
- Avoid setting expectations after mocks have been exercised or cleared.
- Utilize `Mock::AllowLeak()` cautiously when mock lifetimes are complex.
