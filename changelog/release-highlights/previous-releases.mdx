## Guidance for Users Migrating from Older Releases

When updating from earlier versions of GoogleTest, consider the following:

- **Check for Breaking Changes**: Some features might have been deprecated or modified; consult breaking change notices for smooth migration.
- **Test All Legacy Test Suites**: Verify existing tests continue to pass, especially if they use advanced mocking or parameterization.
- **Update Build Configurations**: Ensure your build scripts accommodate any new dependencies or compiler requirements, such as mandatory C++17 support.

<Tip>
Always back up your project and run tests extensively after upgrading GoogleTest. Utilize the detailed migration guides available elsewhere in the documentation to handle breaking changes.
