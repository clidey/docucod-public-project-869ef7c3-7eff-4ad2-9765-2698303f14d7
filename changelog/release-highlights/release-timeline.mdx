# Version History & Timeline

This page provides a clear, chronological record of all significant releases of the GoogleTest and GoogleMock framework. If you want to follow the evolution of the framework, understand the incremental improvements, or identify when a particular feature or change was introduced, this timeline is your starting point.

Each entry in the timeline includes the version number, release date, and a concise summary of the key updates, allowing you to track progress efficiently and link directly to more detailed information if needed.

## Understanding the Version History & Timeline

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are actively maintained frameworks with regular updates to improve usability, compatibility, and features. The Version History & Timeline page organizes these updates in reverse chronological order, making it straightforward to see what is new in the latest releases, and how the framework has matured over time.

Use this timeline to:

- Quickly check the date and version of past releases.
- Identify new features and improvements added in each version.
- Learn about important fixes and changes that might impact your usage.
- Anchor further exploration by linking from a summarized release to detailed release notes or migration guides.

## How to Navigate This Page

- **Version Number:** Follows semantic versioning principles, helping you determine the impact scope from patches to major versions.
- **Release Date:** Indicates the official release date.
- **Summary:** A brief paragraph highlighting key features, fixes, or breaking changes.

This structure is designed to make it easy to scan and locate the precise information you need.

## Benefits of Reviewing the Timeline

Understanding the Version History & Timeline empowers developers to:

- Align their code with the appropriate version and features.
- Prepare for migrations or breaking changes well ahead of time.
- Leverage new capabilities as they are released to write better tests.
- Identify when bugs were resolved to diagnose integration issues.

## Practical Tip

When you upgrade GoogleTest or GoogleMock, consult the timeline first to gauge the scope of changes since your previous version. For major upgrades, also review related breaking changes and migration guides to ensure smooth transitions.
