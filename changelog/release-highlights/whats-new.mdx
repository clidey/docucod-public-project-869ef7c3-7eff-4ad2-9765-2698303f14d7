# What's New in Latest Releases

Welcome to the latest updates of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, your comprehensive C++ testing framework. This page highlights the key new features, platform expansions, and major enhancements from recent releases. Whether you are new to the framework or updating an existing setup, this guide will help you quickly understand the advances and improvements that enhance your testing experience.

---

## Recent Major Release: Version 1.17.0

### Upgrade Requirements and Compatibility
- This release requires a minimum of **C++17** support, aligning with modern C++ standards to improve stability and feature support.
- It marks a continued focus on modernizing the framework's codebase and integrations.

### Key New Features and Improvements
- **Consolidated Repository:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects have been merged to streamline maintenance and provide a unified testing and mocking experience.
- **Enhanced Command-Line Flag Parsing:** The init routines for GoogleMock now effectively parse flags such as `--gmock_verbose` to control verbosity levels. This provides clearer control over test output and diagnostics.
- **Flexible Mocking and Expectation APIs:** Improvements to mock method definitions and expectations make it easier to customize behavior, including better support for actions and matchers.

### Continuous Integration
- The project employs Google's internal continuous integration systems to ensure robust automated testing and quality assurance for every release.

### Planned Future Directions
- The framework plans to adopt [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) as a dependency, aiming to leverage this collection of C++ libraries for consistency and enhanced functionality.

## Notable Platform and Ecosystem Expansions

GoogleTest continues to support a wide array of platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like environments with consistent behavior.

### Integration Ecosystem Updates
- Build system supports and integrations with key players such as CMake and Bazel remain strong and are continuously improved to support seamless setup and usage.

## Enhancements in GoogleMock

### Improved Default Action Management
- The use of `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` macros is refined for better clarity and ease of use.
- Default actions can be specified for mock methods, allowing more flexible and maintainable test setups.

### Mock Strictness Controls
- Support for NiceMock, NaggyMock (default), and StrictMock allows users to fine-tune warnings and failures on uninteresting calls to mocks, supporting cleaner and more stable test outcomes.

### Expanded Support for Complex Mocks
- Continued enhancements in mocking templates, overloaded methods, move-only types, and delegation patterns improve the framework’s adaptability to complex C++ scenarios.

## User-Centric Improvements

- **Verbose Logging:** Enhanced logging options via `--gmock_verbose` flag empower users to get detailed traces during test runs, enabling faster debugging.
- **Expectation Clarity:** Improved matchers and expectation setting support better descriptive messages and error reports, helping pinpoint test failures quickly.

---

## Practical Upgrade Tips

- Verify your compiler supports **C++17** to ensure compatibility with the latest codebase.
- Review and adjust the usage of `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to align with updated best practices.
- Utilize the enhanced verbosity flags during test development and debugging for clearer mock interaction insights.

## Example: Using the Updated GoogleMock Verbose Flag

```bash
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This command increases the verbosity, allowing you to see detailed information about mock function calls and expectations during test execution.
