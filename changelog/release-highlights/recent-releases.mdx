## Release Highlights

GoogleTest continues to evolve as a robust C++ testing framework with strong integration of GoogleMock, offering:

- Enhanced support for the latest C++ standards to bolster code safety and ease of use.
- Seamless merging of GoogleMock and GoogleTest repositories to provide unified releases and simplified usage.
- Rich mocking capabilities with declarative syntax, including mocks for virtual methods, partial mocks, and an extensive set of matchers and actions.
- Improved diagnostics and verbosity controls to help users identify test issues promptly.

Users benefit from consistent updates that maintain cross-platform compatibility and foster rapid test development.

## Breaking Changes & Upgrade Notes

- **C++17 Requirement:** Starting with 1.17.x, the minimum required C++ standard is C++17. Ensure your build environment, compiler, and project settings support this standard.

- **Default Mock Strictness:** Mocks are currently 'naggy' by default, warning on uninteresting calls, but there is consideration to switch to 'nice' mocks by default in future versions. Review your tests for output verbosity and adjust mocks as needed.

- **API Stability:** While GoogleTest strives for backward compatibility, some internal API changes occur between major versions. Consult [How to Upgrade](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/changelog/upgrade-instructions.md) for detailed migration guides.

- **Deprecations:** Deprecated features will be announced and removed in staged releases. Keep an eye on the [Deprecations & Breaking Changes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/changelog/breaking-changes-deprecations.md) document for planning updates.

## Practical Tips for Upgrading

- **Verify Your Toolchain:** Ensure your compiler supports C++17 or later before upgrading to version 1.17.0 or above.

- **Update Build Files:** Adjust your build scripts (CMake, Bazel, etc.) to specify the proper C++ standard.

- **Review Mock Usage:** If your tests depend on strictness modes like naggy or nice mocks, test carefully and consult the [Strictness Modes documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking-framework/strictness-modes.html).

- **Check for Deprecated Methods:** Review release notes for any deprecated APIs and refactor accordingly.
