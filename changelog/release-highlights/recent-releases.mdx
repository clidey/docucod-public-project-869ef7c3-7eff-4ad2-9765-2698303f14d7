## Understanding the Release Flow

GoogleTest follows a semantic versioning approach, with releases categorized into majors, minors, and patches to clearly communicate the scope and impact of changes:

- **Major releases** introduce significant new capabilities or breaking changes.
- **Minor releases** include backward-compatible features and enhancements.
- **Patch releases** focus on bug fixes and minor improvements.

The Recent Releases Overview prioritizes user impact by summarizing what matters most for your testing workflows, linking to detailed notes when you need deeper technical insight.
