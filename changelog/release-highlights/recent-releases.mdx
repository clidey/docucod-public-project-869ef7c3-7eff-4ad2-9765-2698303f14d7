## 1. Latest Stable Release: GoogleTest/GoogleMock v1.17.0

- **Release Date:** [Refer to official release page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0)
- **C++ Standard Requirement:** Minimum C++17 required to compile and use this release.
- **Compatibility:** This release follows [Google’s C++ support policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard) ensuring broad platform compatibility.
- **Highlights:**
  - Updated codebase to require C++17, reflecting modern C++ practices.
  - Continuous integration leveraging Google’s internal systems for robust validation.
  - Planned future dependency on [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) to further enhance functionality.

## 2. Download and Documentation

- **Official Documentation:**
  We recommend accessing the GoogleTest documentation live on GitHub Pages here:
  [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/)

- **Source and Downloads:**
  Available through the main GitHub repository's releases:
  [GoogleTest Releases](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases)

- **Build Configuration:**
  Users can follow detailed building instructions for standalone or embedded integration projects using CMake. Always ensure your build environment is configured to support at least C++17.

## 3. Noteworthy Upgrade Considerations

- **C++17 Compliance:**
  Projects must upgrade to a C++17 compatible compiler and build environment before adopting this version.

- **Transition Advice:**
  Older projects requiring compatibility with pre C++17 standards will need to remain on earlier branches or plan for migration.

- **Dependency Roadmap:**
  The upcoming addition of the Abseil library as a dependency is planned but not yet mandatory; users should monitor release notes and update directions.

## 4. Versioning and Release Strategy

While this page focuses on the most recent release, GoogleTest adheres to semantic versioning principles with clear branch distinctions:

- **Stable branches:** Receive minor updates and security patches.
- **Major releases:** May include breaking changes such as the upgrade to C++17.
- **Pre-releases:** Announced with clear tagging for early adopters.

## 5. Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance

GoogleTest leverages Google’s internal CI systems to ensure high quality and reliability. Updates undergo extensive automated testing before being published.
