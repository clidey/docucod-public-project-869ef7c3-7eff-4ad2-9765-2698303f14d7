## Latest Release Highlights

### Version 1.17.0
*Release Date: Refer to [Release 1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0)*

- **Minimum C++ Standard Requirement Increased to C++17**
  - Starting from 1.17.x, GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler, marking a modernization milestone that ensures compatibility with modern C++ features and promotes cleaner code.

- **Documentation Migration**
  - The official documentation is now hosted on GitHub Pages for easier access and improved navigation: https://google.github.io/googletest/

- **Integration Tidying**
  - The repository merges GoogleTest and GoogleMock, streamlining building and usage.
  - CMake support is enhanced, allowing standalone and embedded project builds with simplified configuration.

- **Code Modernization & API Stability**
  - Internal improvements to support thread safety, better test registration, and flag handling while preserving backward compatibility where possible.

- **New Build Options and Tweaks**
  - CMake option to build without GoogleMock when users want GoogleTest only (`-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`).
  - Support for Visual Studio runtime library dynamic linking through `gtest_force_shared_crt` option.

## Recent Feature Additions

### Test Discovery and Execution
- Tests are automatically discovered and registered via macro usage (`TEST()`, `TEST_F()`), now fully supporting typed and parameterized tests.
- Allows selective test execution with the enhanced `--gtest_filter` flag supporting glob patterns and exclusion lists.

### Enhanced Assertion Macros
- Wide coverage of assertions including Boolean checks, equality, string comparison, exceptions, and floating point near-equality.
- Fatal (`ASSERT_*`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) failures clearly distinguished to guide proper error handling strategies.

### Test Parameterization
- Added support for value-parameterized (`TEST_P`) and type-parameterized tests, enabling concise yet powerful test case expansions.
- Registry and automatic instantiation mechanisms streamline writing combinatorial tests across data inputs and types.

### Death Tests
- Support for death tests (tests that verify program termination conditions) with `ASSERT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_DEATH` macros.
- Multiple death test styles supported (`fast`, `threadsafe`), allowing adaptation to platform and test needs.
- Improved integration to avoid deadlocks and hangs, with best practices outlined in advanced guides.

### Comprehensive Test Event Listening
- Event listener API extended to observe test lifecycle events: start/end of test program, test suites, tests, and assertions.
- Default listeners for console output, XML output, and optional streaming of results over network sockets for continuous integration environments.

### Improved Test Result Reporting
- Rich metadata via `TestProperty` records for custom reporting.
- Detailed timing, pass/fail/skipped counts at test, suite, and program levels.
- XML output format customizable with output path and naming.

### Thread Safety and Concurrency
- Expanded multi-threading support when platform pthreads or equivalent synchronization primitives are available.
- ThreadLocal storage and mutex implementations for safe test execution.

### Build System and Platform Support Enhancements
- Extended platform coverage with explicit detection of environments supporting exceptions, RTTI, file system features, and threading.
- Improved Windows support including Unicode `main()` argument handling and runtime linkage options.
- Integration with Google’s internal CI and plans to adopt Abseil dependencies for future releases.

## Practical Impact for Users

Whether you are writing your first unit test or scaling to large, parameterized test suites, the recent updates bring clearer APIs, stronger type safety, improved cross-platform compatibility, and better tooling support. Test authors benefit from easier filtering and organization, and test runners can leverage enhanced event listeners to build integrations with dashboards and CI pipelines.

## Examples of Usage for New Features

### Using `--gtest_filter` with Exclusion

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter="MyTestSuite.*-MyTestSuite.FlakyTest"
```
Runs all tests in `MyTestSuite` except tests named `FlakyTest`.

### Writing a Value-Parameterized Test

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, HandlesVariousValues) {
  int value = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(value, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, MyParamTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Failing to detect tests:** Ensure `InitGoogleTest()` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- **Build errors related to C++ version:** Verify your compiler meets the C++17 requirement.
- **Conflicts with runtime libraries on Windows:** Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake flag.
- **Unexpected deadlocks or hangs in death tests:** Review platform-specific death test styles and consult death test documentation.
