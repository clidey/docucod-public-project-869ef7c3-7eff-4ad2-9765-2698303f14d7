# Notable New Features & Improvements

Stay informed about the latest capabilities added to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page highlights new developer-facing features, usability enhancements, and integration improvements that enable your team to adopt and leverage new capabilities efficiently.

---

## 1. Expanded Test Macros and Lifecycle Enhancements

- **New Parameterized and Typed Test Macros**: Added support for refined typed and value-parameterized tests using `TEST_P`, `TYPED_TEST`, `TYPED_TEST_P`, and related macros, enabling more expressive and reusable test definitions spanning multiple input values and types.

- **Seamless Test Fixture Integration**: Enhanced compatibility of test fixtures (`TEST_F`) with setup and teardown routines (`SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, `SetUpTestSuite()`, `TearDownTestSuite()`), allowing more efficient shared resource management across tests.

- **Improved Naming Conventions**: Adopted clearer naming standards, including replacing the deprecated `TestCase` with `TestSuite`, aligning terminology with international standards like ISTQB for better clarity.

## 2. Advanced Assertion Capabilities

- **Rich Assertion Variants**: Expanded the collection of assertion macros supporting fatal (`ASSERT_*`) and nonfatal (`EXPECT_*`) variants, explicit success (`SUCCEED()`) and failure (`FAIL()`) signaling, and custom failure messaging using streaming operators.

- **Predicate and Predicate-Formatter Assertions**: Introduced assertions that use predicate functions returning `AssertionResult` for richer, tailored failure messages, improving debugging and test clarity.

- **String and Floating-Point Enhancements**: Added specialized assertions for C-string comparisons (`EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_STRNE`, etc.) and floating-point comparisons (`EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`), addressing common testing pitfalls.

- **Exception Assertions**: Enabled checks for correct exception throwing and handling with macros like `EXPECT_THROW` and `ASSERT_NO_THROW`, expanding robustness coverage.

## 3. Rich Parameterized Test Features

- **Value-Parameterized Test Instantiation**: The `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` macro now supports a variety of parameter generators such as `Range()`, `Values()`, `ValuesIn()`, and combinatory generators, enabling comprehensive data-driven testing.

- **Custom Parameter Naming Functions**: The optional last argument to instantiations accepts functors or lambdas generating descriptive, unique test names, enhancing test report readability.

- **Support for Value and Type-Parameterized Test Patterns**: Improved abstractions for abstract tests and reuse of test logic, encouraging defining tests in library-like patterns and instantiating across projects.

## 4. Improved Death Test Support

- **Multiple Death Test Styles**: Supported both “fast” and “threadsafe” death test modes, optimizing test reliability across multithreaded environments and making death tests safer and more performant.

- **Best Practice Enforcement**: Encouraged naming conventions like appending `DeathTest` to test suites containing death tests to ensure predictable test execution ordering and resource isolation.

- **Flexible Death Assertions**: Enhanced macros `EXPECT_DEATH`, `ASSERT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_EXIT`, and others allow complex statements and exit status checks with flexible stderr matching using regex or matchers.

## 5. Enhanced Event Listener API

- **Extensible Test Event Listening**: Added `TestEventListener` and the convenient `EmptyTestEventListener` base class, enabling users to implement custom handlers for test start, end, failure, suite lifecycle, and other test execution events.

- **Ordering and Ownership Improvements**: Guaranteed event listeners are invoked in predictable orders, with ownership and lifetime management handled automatically by GoogleTest.

- **Sample Usage**:

```cpp
class MinimalistPrinter : public testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    printf("*** Test %s.%s starting.\n", test_info.test_suite_name(), test_info.name());
  }

  void OnTestPartResult(const testing::TestPartResult& result) override {
    printf("%s in %s:%d\n%s\n", 
      result.failed() ? "*** Failure" : "Success", 
      result.file_name(), 
      result.line_number(), 
      result.summary());
  }

  void OnTestEnd(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    printf("*** Test %s.%s ending.\n", test_info.test_suite_name(), test_info.name());
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners().Append(new MinimalistPrinter);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## 6. Console Output and Reporting Improvements

- **Colorized Terminal Output**: GoogleTest automatically detects terminal capability and emits colored pass/fail indicators, improving user experience.

- **XML and JSON Reports**: Users now can generate detailed machine-readable XML and JSON reports for integration with CI dashboards and test reporting tools via `--gtest_output` flag.

- **Selective Test Execution and Filtering**: Improved support for running subsets of tests through the `--gtest_filter` flag, including negation patterns and list-only test listing with `--gtest_list_tests`.

- **Sharding and Repeating Tests**: Added test sharding via environment variables (`GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`, `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`) to enable parallel test executions across machines, and repeat flags (`--gtest_repeat`) to identify flaky tests.

## 7. Platform and Build Integration Enhancements

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Rigorous support for Linux, macOS, Windows, and others, with build configurations adapting to platform differences including threading, exceptions, and system calls.

- **Build System Compatibility**: Streamlined integration with CMake and Bazel with pre-configured rules and libraries such as `gtest`, `gtest_main`, and `gtest_for_library`.

- **Flag Handling and Initialization**: Flags for controlling test execution (color support, fail fast, filters, etc.) are parsed through `InitGoogleTest()` ensuring central initialization.

## Tips for Adopting New Features

- When designing new tests, consider using the value- and type-parameterized test macros to maximize code reuse and coverage.

- Use `ASSERT_` variants carefully to abort functions when continuation is unsafe, and prefer `EXPECT_` variants to let tests reveal multiple failures.

- Leverage event listeners to customize and enrich test output, logs, or integrate with external monitoring.

- Use custom parameter naming functions for parameterized tests to improve the clarity of test outputs and filtering.

- Follow recommended naming conventions especially for death tests to ensure stable and predictable test runs.
