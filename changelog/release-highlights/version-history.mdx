## Troubleshooting Version Upgrades

If you encounter issues after upgrading:

1. **Verify Compiler and Platform Support:** Ensure your environment meets the minimum C++17 and compiler requirements enforced by recent versions.
2. **Review Release Notes Thoroughly:** Check for any deprecations or behavioral changes affecting your tests.
3. **Fallback Options:** If necessary, use a previous stable patch release with fewer breaking changes until your codebase adapts.
