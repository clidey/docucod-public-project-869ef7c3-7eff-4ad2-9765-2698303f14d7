## Understanding Versioning

GoogleTest uses semantic versioning to clearly signal the scope and impact of changes:

- **Minor versions** add new features while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Patch versions** focus on bug fixes and security patches.

This versioning approach enables users to anticipate migration efforts and plan upgrades effectively.
