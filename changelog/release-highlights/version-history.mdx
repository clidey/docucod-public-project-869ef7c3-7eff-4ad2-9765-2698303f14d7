# Version History & Key Updates

This page presents a clear, chronological timeline of GoogleTest’s public releases, enabling users to quickly grasp how the framework has evolved over time. Each version is summarized with its key purpose, notable feature additions, improvements, and fixes. This overview helps users understand the progression in capabilities and aids in making informed upgrade decisions.

---

## Versioning Strategy

GoogleTest uses semantic versioning to communicate the scope and impact of each release:

- **Major Versions**: Introduce significant new features, architectural changes, and occasionally backward-incompatible changes. Users should review migration guides closely before upgrading.
- **Minor Versions**: Add new features and improvements without breaking backward compatibility.
- **Patch Versions**: Focus on bug fixes, security patches, and performance enhancements.

The version format follows `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 1.17.0).

The current stable branch requires at least C++17 compliance to ensure compatibility with modern C++ standards and features.

## Release Highlights

### Latest Major Release: 1.17.0
- Introduced mandatory C++17 usage for the 1.17.x branch to modernize the codebase and improve performance and maintainability.
- Documentation migrated to GitHub Pages for better accessibility and browsing experience.
- Continued improvements in test discovery and parallel test execution for faster test runs.

### Recent Key Features Across Versions
- **Unified Distribution**: Merging of GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects for streamlined maintenance and releases.
- **Rich Assertion Set**: Expansion of assertion macros for equality, inequality, exceptions, death tests, and user-defined assertions.
- **Test Parameterization**: Support for value-parameterized and type-parameterized tests to promote test reuse and broad coverage.
- **Flexible Output Options**: Built-in support for producing XML and JSON reports, aiding integration with continuous integration systems.
- **Enhanced Mocking Support**: Various improvements to mock strictness control, call ordering, and action specifications.

### Stability and Fixes
- Numerous stability patches, memory leak fixes, and enhanced thread safety.
- Better handling of disabled and flaky tests.
- Improved platform support following Google’s foundational C++ policy.

## Breaking Changes and Migration

- Users moving to 1.17.x must ensure their build environment supports C++17 or later.
- Deprecated flags or API elements are documented in each release note to aid migration.
- Migration paths and compatibility information are available for major version transitions.

## Deprecations and Removal Notices
- Gradual removal of legacy support for older compilers and non-C++17 compliant code.
- Phasing out of older death test execution styles in favor of thread-safe implementations.
