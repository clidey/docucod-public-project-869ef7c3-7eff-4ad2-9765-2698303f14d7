# Latest Release (1.17.0)

An overview of the current official release (1.17.0), focusing on its key improvements, new capabilities, and compatibility requirements. This page is the primary reference for users upgrading or starting fresh with this version.

---

## 1. Release Overview

GoogleTest 1.17.0 marks the latest stable release in the 1.17.x series, embodying Google's continued commitment to providing a powerful, reliable, and user-friendly C++ testing framework. This release continues to build upon previous versions with improved platform support, modern C++ standards compliance, and enhanced integration options.

This page guides you through the essential changes and considerations when adopting GoogleTest 1.17.0.

---

## 2. Key Improvements and New Capabilities

### 2.1 Minimum C++17 Requirement

- **Enforced C++17 Standard:** Starting from version 1.17.0, GoogleTest requires compiling with at least C++17 enabled. This ensures better language features support, modern library compatibility, and improved code maintainability.

- **How to comply:**
  - Update your build configuration to specify `-std=c++17` or the equivalent flag in your compiler settings.
  - If using CMake, set the standard explicitly via:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

### 2.2 Simplified Build and Integration

- **Standalone and Embedded builds:** The release maintains support for flexible build workflows, including building GoogleTest as a standalone project or integrating directly into your existing CMake-based project using `add_subdirectory()`.

- **GoogleMock included by default:** In a typical CMake build, GoogleMock is built alongside GoogleTest, unless explicitly disabled with `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.

- **Improved Visual Studio Runtime Linking:** The introduction of the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option enables easier alignment of runtime library settings in Visual Studio projects, resolving previous conflicts between static and dynamic runtimes.

### 2.3 Multi-threaded Tests and Thread Safety

- GoogleTest continues to support thread-safe test execution where pthread is available.
- Users can force the use or disabling of pthread via compiler flags `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if detection fails.

### 2.4 Enhanced Macro Name Clashes Handling

- To prevent macro name conflicts with other libraries, GoogleTest now allows renaming specific macros by defining `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO NAME>=1` on the compiler command line.
- This feature lets you safely use macros like `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`, and others without collisions by internally prefixing them with `GTEST_` (e.g., `GTEST_TEST`).

### 2.5 Shared Library (DLL) Support

- GoogleTest supports compiling the framework as a shared library for environments that require DLLs.
- To enable shared library builds, users must add `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when compiling GoogleTest itself and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when compiling tests that consume it.

---

## 3. Compatibility and Platform Support

- **Supported platforms:** Continues to align with Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy, covering Linux, Windows, macOS, and BSD variants.
- **Compiler support:** Requires compilers with robust C++17 support (e.g., GCC 7.3+, Clang 5.0+, MSVC 2017+).
- **Build tools:** Compatible with CMake 3.14 or newer; Bazel integration remains supported.

Ensure your environment matches these minimal system requirements for a smooth upgrade or fresh start.

## 4. Upgrade and Installation Guidance

### 4.1 Installing or Upgrading with CMake

Follow these steps when installing or upgrading to GoogleTest 1.17.0 using CMake:

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository at 1.17.0 Tag">
Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
```
This ensures you are working with the official stable release.
</Step>
<Step title="Build GoogleTest">

```bash
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Add `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` to `cmake` if you only want GoogleTest.

</Step>
<Step title="Install (Optional)">

```bash
sudo make install
```

Installs GoogleTest to the system default location.
</Step>
</Steps>

### 4.2 Integrate into Your CMake Project

You can directly embed GoogleTest source via `add_subdirectory()` for seamless integration:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/v1.17.0.zip
)
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test GTest::gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_test COMMAND my_test)
```

## 5. Practical Tips for a Smooth Transition

- **Verify Compiler Flags:** Double-check your project build flags to ensure C++17 is enabled.

- **Review Macro Usage:** If your codebase conflicts with GoogleTest macros, adopt the macro renaming flags to avoid clashes.

- **Build System Synchronization:** For projects mixing GoogleTest with other libraries, align runtime linkage settings using `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake.

- **Thread Safety Flags:** Explicitly toggle pthread flags if encountering link or runtime issues related to threading.

- **Follow Best Practices:** Refer to the [Installation Guide](../../getting-started/setup-overview/installation-guide) and [Integration with Build Systems](../../overview/integrations/integration-with-build-systems) for comprehensive setup strategies.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

- Ensure your compiler fully supports C++17.
- Check include paths and linker configurations.
- Confirm CMake version is 3.14 or later.

### Runtime Link Errors on Windows

- Mismatched runtime libraries cause linker errors; use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align settings.

### Macro Conflicts

- Use the macro renaming feature to prefix GoogleTest macros and avoid collisions.

### Test Discovery Problems

- Validate test case names and test fixtures follow GoogleTest conventions.
- Use command line flag `--gtest_list_tests` to debug discovery.

Refer to the [Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/first-steps-validation/common-setup-issues) and [Build Errors Troubleshooting](../../faq/troubleshooting/build-errors) for deeper diagnostics.

## 7. Where to Go Next

Once upgraded or freshly installed:

- Write and run your first test: [Writing and Running Your First Test](../../getting-started/first-steps-validation/writing-first-test).
- Explore core testing features: [Test Definition & Execution](../../api-reference/core-testing-api/test-definition-execution).
- Utilize mocks: [Creating and Using Mocks with GoogleMock](../../guides/core-testing-workflows/using-mocks).
- Optimize test suite performance: [Scaling Test Suites and Optimizing Performance](../../guides/advanced-and-best-practices/scaling-and-performance).

For continuous integration scenarios, consult [Integrating GoogleTest in CI Pipelines](../../guides/advanced-and-best-practices/integrating-with-ci).
