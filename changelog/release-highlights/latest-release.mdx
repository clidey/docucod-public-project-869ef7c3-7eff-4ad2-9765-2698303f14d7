# Latest Release Overview

## Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive overview of the current stable release of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It highlights the key features, enhancements, and important platform-related notes that guide users in deciding when and why to upgrade. Whether you are new to the framework or an existing user planning an upgrade, this overview distills essential information to understand the value and impact of the latest release.

## 1. Release Highlights

### 1.1 Key Features

- **Full GoogleMock Integration:**
  The release consolidates GoogleMock as a core part of the GoogleTest framework, providing seamless mocking capabilities alongside unit testing. Users can write better C++ tests that simulate dependencies with declarative syntax and rich matchers.

- **Flexible Main Entrypoint Options:**
  Users now have distinct `gtest_main` and `gmock_main` libraries to link against, enabling projects to choose whether to include a default `main()` function or supply their own. This flexibility supports different integration scenarios and custom test runner requirements.

- **Threading and Platform Enhancements:**
  GoogleTest continues to improve multi-threading support and compatibility with modern C++ standards (C++17 or later), ensuring robust test execution across supported platforms.

- **Enhanced Mocking Controls:**
  Advanced mocking features including partial (hybrid) mocks, strictness wrappers (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, `NaggyMock`), and fine-grained control of call expectations and ordering empower users to craft precise and maintainable unit tests.

- **Improved Build and Installation Support:**
  CMake integration, now community-maintained, offers standard installation paths and options to build GoogleMock tests optionally, supporting a broad spectrum of build environments.

### 1.2 Performance and Stability Improvements

- Optimized test discovery and startup times facilitate faster feedback in continuous integration pipelines.

- Stability enhancements reduce rare test flakiness and improve consistency of expectation verification.

- Better error diagnostics in mock failures help users rapidly pinpoint issues.

### 1.3 Documentation and Usability

- Updated online documentation consolidates guides, cheat sheets, and cookbooks, making it easier for users to find practical examples and best practices.

- Community-contributed documentation continues to expand, offering additional insights beyond the official guides.

## 2. Platform and Compatibility Notes

### 2.1 Supported Platforms

- Linux, Windows, and macOS remain fully supported with compatibility targeted at modern compilers supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+).

- Threading model support varies: POSIX threads (pthread) support is required on Unix-like systems; Windows threading APIs are supported on Windows.

### 2.2 Build System Considerations

- CMake support is community-driven; users should verify their build configurations especially if upgrading from older versions.

- Options such as `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` and `gmock_build_tests` provide flexible customization within CMake projects.

- GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest; both are version-aligned in this release to ensure compatibility.

### 2.3 API Stability

- The release maintains source and binary compatibility with previous minor and patch versions.

- There are no breaking API changes in this stable release; however, users should review deprecated features noted in related documentation.

## 3. How to Upgrade

### 3.1 Upgrade Preparation

- Review your project’s build configuration to ensure correct linkage — linking your tests against `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` libraries as appropriate.

- Confirm your compiler and platform support meet the minimum requirements (C++17, threading support).

- If previously using custom main functions, consider migrating to the official `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` targets for consistency.

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Upgrade

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain the Latest Release">
    Download or clone the latest source from the official repository at https://github.com/google/googletest.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Build Scripts">
    Adjust CMake or other build scripts to reference updated targets `gmock`, `gmock_main`, `gtest`, and `gtest_main` as needed. Enable optional test builds by setting `-Dgmock_build_tests=ON` if desired.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Rebuild Your Test Binaries">
    Compile the test executable. Use `gmock_main` for tests requiring GoogleMock support with a default `main()` or `gmock` if you supply a custom `main()`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run and Validate Tests">
    Execute tests via `ctest` or your build tooling; verify all expectations and assertions pass and that test outputs are as expected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Consult Troubleshooting Documentation">
    If issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting setup and test failure guides, especially concerning linking, threading, or mocking behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Linker Errors:** Ensure the proper `gmock` or `gmock_main` libraries are linked and that compiler flags reflect C++17 and threading support.

- **Unexpected Test Failures:** Check for API mismatches or outdated expectations caused by changed mocking behavior.

- **Build Failures on CMake:** Verify community CMake scripts are up to date; consider cleaning the build cache.

- **Test Startup Issues:** Verify your `main()` linkage aligns with your chosen libraries (`gmock_main` / `gtest_main`).
