# Bug Fixes and Patches

This page provides a detailed summary of the minor yet user-impactful fixes, security patches, and stability improvements included in each GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. It is designed to enable development teams and integrators to quickly assess the urgency and relevance of applying minor upgrades to their testing frameworks.

---

## Understanding the Scope of Bug Fixes and Patches

GoogleTest and GoogleMock continuously evolve to improve test reliability, safety, and correctness. While major releases bring new features and possible breaking changes, the patches covered here focus solely on:

- Resolving bugs that might cause incorrect test behavior or crashes.
- Addressing security vulnerabilities that affect mocking and testing integrity.
- Fixing edge cases and rare scenarios that impact stability.
- Minor improvements that do not change APIs or require source code migration.

This focus ensures teams can prioritize these updates without extensive regression testing or redesign.


## How to Use This Page

1. **Locate your current framework version.**
2. Review the fixes and patches introduced in subsequent releases.
3. Evaluate the impact based on your usage of GoogleTest/GoogleMock.
4. Decide if the update is critical for your environment (e.g., security fix) or recommended for improved stability.
5. Follow upgrade guides if available for non-breaking version bumps.

## Sample Entries of Recent Bug Fixes and Patches

### Version 1.13.0 (2024-06-01)
- Fixed a rare issue causing race conditions in parallel test sharding.
- Patched a memory leak observed in some mock object destruction scenarios.
- Addressed verbose flag parsing to correctly handle edge cases with wide-character inputs.
- Improved error messages to include stack traces for easier debugging of unexpected calls.

### Version 1.12.3 (2024-03-15)
- Resolved a bug where `NiceMock` did not suppress warnings for certain inherited mock methods.
- Fixed interaction behavior in mock sequences when expectations retire on saturation.
- Security patch addressing potential information leak through detailed matcher error outputs.

### Version 1.12.2 (2024-01-10)
- Fixed parsing of ON_CALL and EXPECT_CALL with complex matcher and action combinations.
- Corrected compilation issues with GCC 12 and higher when building mock classes.
- Minor performance improvements in mocking framework internal data structures.

## Common Themes in Bug Fixes

- **Mock Behavior and Expectation Handling:** Several bug fixes address improper matching logic, incorrect lifetime management of mocks, and unexpected call failure reporting.

- **Compiler Compatibility:** Patches often improve compatibility with modern compilers and build environments, ensuring smooth integration in diverse setups.

- **Verbose Logging and Diagnostics:** Enhancements in the diagnostic output make failures easier to understand and troubleshoot, vital for complex mock scenarios.

- **Thread Safety:** Fixes related to multi-threaded test execution reduce flaky tests and improve stability in concurrent environments.

## Best Practices for Applying Patches

- Always consult the [release notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) for full details on patch contents.
- Test patched versions in a staging environment if possible, focusing on your most sensitive and critical tests.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag to increase diagnostic output when investigating behavior changes.
- Check your mock class designs against known caveats, especially when using inheritance and constructor forwarding in `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`.


---

## Troubleshooting Tips for Bug Fixes

- **Unexpected Call Failures:** Inspect call sequences and usages of `RetiresOnSaturation()` which changed behavior in recent patches.
- **Warnings on Uninteresting Calls:** Review how `NiceMock` and `NaggyMock` wrappers are applied to your mocks; upgraded implementations may have refined behavior.
- **Compilation Errors Post-Patch:** Validate your compiler version against supported platforms and check for updated mock method macro usages from [`MOCK_METHOD`](reference/mocking-framework/mock-class-definitions) documentation.

## Summary
This page is part of the changelog section, focusing specifically on bug fixes and minor patches. It complements pages covering new features, breaking changes, and upgrade guidance by providing granular information on the fixes that improve test reliability and security without altering core APIs or behavior expectations.


---

## Example Scenario
Imagine your team relies heavily on `NiceMock` wrappers for your mock objects. After upgrading from version 1.12.1 to 1.12.3, you notice some warnings about uninteresting calls have disappeared, and some error messages now include detailed stack traces. Consulting this page explains that these are intentional improvements from patch updates, helping you understand why behavior changed and how to best leverage the new diagnostics.
