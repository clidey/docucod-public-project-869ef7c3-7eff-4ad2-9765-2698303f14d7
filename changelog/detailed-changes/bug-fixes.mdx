## Recent Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

### Version 1.12.1 (2024-06-01)
- Fixed deadlock issues occurring in multithreaded test environments when using typed test fixtures.
- Resolved memory leaks detected when using `EXPECT_DEATH` macros in corner cases.
- Improved robustness of test filter parsing to avoid crashes with complex filter expressions.

### Version 1.12.0 (2024-04-15)
- Patched a race condition in global fixture teardown on certain Linux platforms.
- Addressed inconsistencies in stream redirection leading to truncated test output.
- Corrected improper handling of exceptions during death test execution.

### Version 1.11.3 (2023-12-20)
- Fixed intermittent crashes caused by unsafe access to thread-local storage when running tests in parallel.
- Enhanced stability of the logging system to prevent spurious test failures related to log capture.

### Version 1.11.2 (2023-10-05)
- Addressed build failures on older GCC versions due to stricter constexpr evaluation.
- Patched issue with mock methods incorrectly handling move-only types.
- Improved handling of unexpected calls on nice mock objects to reduce false warnings.

### Version 1.11.1 (2023-08-15)
- Fixed improper cleanup of test environments shared between parameterized tests.
- Corrected subtleties in matching null pointer literals in assertions leading to false negatives.

### Version 1.11.0 (2023-06-01)
- Resolved a bug causing `TEST_P` to sometimes fail silently on Windows in presence of dynamic parameter generators.
- Improved synchronization in the internal thread handling primitives to avoid deadlocks.

## Bug Fixes Categorized

- **Thread Safety and Concurrency**
  - Fixes to mutex locking and thread-local storage to ensure assertions and mocks operate reliably in multi-threaded tests.
  - Improvements in death test strategies to avoid hangs and race conditions.

- **Memory Management**
  - Resolutions for memory leaks in mocks and during death test runs, especially involving unique pointers and move-only types.

- **Assertion & Matcher Reliability**
  - Corrections in evaluation of complex matchers and predicate assertions.
  - Fixes to handling of `nullptr` and `NULL` in expectation macros.

- **Test Discovery and Filter Parsing**
  - Enhancements ensuring that test filtering works consistently across different platforms and filter complexity.

- **Platform Compatibility**
  - Various platform-specific fixes, addressing Linux, Windows, and macOS issues related to compilation, runtime behavior, and file system handling.

- **Mocking Enhancements**
  - Improvements in handling expectations for overloaded, non-virtual, and templated methods.
  - Better support for delegating calls to fakes or real objects without causing unexpected failures.

## Best Practices for Stability

- When using death tests in multi-threaded environments, prefer the "threadsafe" death test style by setting:

  ```cpp
  GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
  ```

- Use `NiceMock` wrappers to suppress benign warnings about uninteresting mock calls, but avoid overusing `StrictMock` to prevent fragile tests.

- Be mindful when overriding default actions in mocks; carefully distinguish between `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` to avoid false negatives and unstable tests.

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` in helper functions that contain assertions to provide better context for failures.

---

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- Make sure to match test and fixture expectations precisely; minor mismatches often account for failures thought to be caused by bugs.
- When integrating with build systems, be aware of platform-specific quirks affecting test discovery and execution.
- For flakiness in death tests, check thread availability and process spawning options.
