# Feature Enhancements and Improvements

This documentation details the smaller yet impactful feature additions, optimizations, and user experience improvements made to the GoogleMock (gMock) framework that enhance its usability, performance, and reliability without introducing headline features. These enhancements allow users to write more maintainable, efficient, and expressive tests while benefiting from incremental improvements under the hood.

---

## 1. MOCK_METHOD Macro Enhancements

### Expanded Support for Method Signatures

- The `MOCK_METHOD` macro now fully supports a wider range of method qualifiers including `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, and calling conventions via `Calltype(...)`.
- Enhanced support ensures smoother mocking of overloaded, const, and templated methods, aligning declaration with the base method signature.

### Handling Commas and Complex Types

- Argument types containing commas (e.g., STL containers such as `std::map<int, double>`) require wrapping in additional parentheses to parse correctly.
- Alternatively, users can define type aliases for complex types to simplify `MOCK_METHOD` usage.

### Mocking Non-Virtual and Template Methods

- Support for mocking class templates and non-virtual methods via the same macro improves flexibility in composing mocks.
- Users can mock class templates as straightforwardly as normal classes by defining `MOCK_METHOD`s inside template mock classes.

### Optimizing Compilation Times

- Users are encouraged to separate mock class constructors and destructors into `.cc` files to reduce compilation overhead, particularly beneficial for mocks with numerous methods.

---

## 2. Expectations and Actions Improvements

### Clear Separation and Semantics of ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL

- `ON_CALL` defines default behavior of mock methods without setting an expectation that the call must occur.
- `EXPECT_CALL` both defines behavior and sets expectations about the number of calls, argument matching, and call order.
- Emphasis on judicious use of `ON_CALL` to avoid overly strict tests and reduce brittle test failures.

### Support for Chaining and Precise Control of Behaviors

- Multiple `WillOnce()` actions followed by a single `WillRepeatedly()` allow detailed behavior sequences during repeated calls.
- The `.RetiresOnSaturation()` clause instructs expectations to become inactive once their call upper bound is reached, avoiding undesired upper-bound violations and enabling flexible fallback to other expectations.

### Argument Matching and Combinators

- Rich support for argument matchers (`_`, `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Field()`, `Property()`) allows precise matching of complex parameter patterns.
- Combining matchers for validating member values, container contents, or pointer targets enhances expressiveness.

### Matchers Can Be Used as Predicates

- Matchers can be plugged into user predicates via `Matches()`.
- `Truly()` supports arbitrary unary predicates as matchers when built-in ones are insufficient.

### Advanced Ordering Control

- Users can specify strict or partial ordering of expectations using `InSequence` or `After()` clauses, allowing precise control over invocation ordering to reflect realistic call dependencies.

## 3. Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

### Controlling Uninteresting Call Behavior

- Three wrappers (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`) modify how uninteresting calls (calls to methods without matching `EXPECT_CALL`) are treated:
  - `NiceMock`: suppresses uninteresting call warnings (quiet by default).
  - `NaggyMock`: prints warnings on uninteresting calls (current default behavior).
  - `StrictMock`: treats any uninteresting call as a test failure, enforcing strictness.

### Usage Patterns

- These wrappers inherit all constructors of the base mock class, allowing easy substitution.
- Recommended best practice is to prefer `NiceMock` for routine tests to reduce noise, use `NaggyMock` when debugging, and reserve `StrictMock` for critical strictness scenarios.

### Limitations and Caveats

- `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` only affect mock methods defined with `MOCK_METHOD` directly in the mock class, not inherited mock methods.
- Nesting these wrappers (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockFoo>>`) is unsupported.
- Proper behavior depends on mock classes having virtual destructors.

## 4. Actions and Custom Behavior Enhancements

### Using Functions, Lambdas, and Callables as Actions

- Users can specify arbitrary callable objects (functions, functors, lambdas) as actions in `WillOnce()` or `WillRepeatedly()` for expressive, inline behaviors.
- Supports actions with no arguments (`InvokeWithoutArgs()`) as well as invoking callable arguments passed into mocks (`InvokeArgument<N>()`).

### Composite and Argument-Selective Actions

- Actions like `DoAll()`, `IgnoreResult()`, `WithArg<N>()`, and `WithArgs<N1, N2, ...>()` let users compose sequences of sub-actions, discard results, or pass selected arguments to inner actions for fine-grained control.

### Built-in Side Effect Actions

- Convenient helpers like `SetArgPointee<N>(value)`, `SetArrayArgument<N>(first, last)`, and `DeleteArg<N>()` enable easy mocking of methods with output or side effects.

### Returning Live or Reference Values

- Supporting `ReturnRef()`, `ReturnPointee()`, and `ReturnNew<T>(...)` actions allow returning references or dynamically constructed objects, ensuring that mock behaviors can simulate realistic value lifetimes.

### Defining Custom Actions

- Users are encouraged to write custom action classes with a `Perform()` method, or use `MakePolymorphicAction()` for polymorphic actions.
- Legacy `ACTION()`, `ACTION_P()`, and `ACTION_TEMPLATE()` macros remain supported but are discouraged for new code.

## 5. Verification and Lifecycle Controls

### Forced Verification

- Beyond automatic verification at destruction, explicit calls to `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` and `Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock_obj)` allow manual verification and reset of expectations and default actions to handle complex ownership lifetimes.

### Allowing Leaks

- `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj)` informs the framework that verification can be skipped for a mock known to be intentionally leaked.

---

## 6. Thread Safety and Debugging Enhancements

### Guidelines for Multithreaded Tests

- Tests are advised to set expectations and verify on a single thread.
- Mock method calls can be invoked concurrently from multiple threads; internal synchronization ensures thread safety.
- Actions execute in the caller thread but do not impose order across threads.

### Verbosity and Diagnostic Controls

- The `--gmock_verbose=[info|warning|error]` flag controls the volume of logging regarding mock call behaviors and uninteresting call notifications.
- Setting `--gmock_verbose=info` provides detailed call traces for deep debugging, while `error` minimizes output to errors only.

---

## 7. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use `ON_CALL()` by default to define behavior and only use `EXPECT_CALL()` when the call count and arguments must be verified.
- Define the mock class’s constructor and destructor in `.cc` files to speed up compilation.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` when chaining multiple expectations to avoid sticky expectations causing erroneous failures.
- For overloaded methods, mock all variants or use `using` declarations to avoid hiding base class methods unintentionally.
- Prefer coding to interfaces and mocking interfaces instead of concrete classes where possible to improve test maintainability.
