# New Features & Enhancements

This page summarizes the recent new capabilities, extended APIs, and improved behaviors introduced in GoogleTest releases. It is designed to help users quickly understand the value delivered in each update and guide them to relevant documentation or examples for adoption.

---

## Overview

The **New Features & Enhancements** page highlights the latest product improvements that empower you to write clearer, more robust, and more flexible C++ tests. Each entry provides context on what was added or improved, why it matters, and points to detailed documentation or real-world use cases when applicable.

This disciplined approach enables users to grasp the impact of ongoing development at a glance and to seamlessly incorporate new functionality into their testing workflows.

## Recent Feature Highlights

### Enhanced Test Parameterization
GoogleTest has expanded its support for both value-parameterized and type-parameterized tests to facilitate testing across diverse inputs and type lists.

- **Support for rich parameter generators and custom naming functions** allows you to generate multiple test permutations with descriptive names, improving test discoverability and result analysis.
- Detailed guidance on using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`, `TEST_P`, `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`, and `TYPED_TEST` ensures you can reduce code duplication while maintaining readability.

Explore more in the [Testing Reference - Parameterized and Typed Tests](docs/reference/testing.md#TEST_P).

### Advanced Mocking Control
GoogleMockâ€™s mocking capabilities have been refined to provide more granular control over mocks and expectations.

- The `MOCK_METHOD` macro enhancements allow clearer declarations of mock methods, handling complex signatures including those with commas.
- Expectation setting via `EXPECT_CALL` has been expanded with additional clauses like `.With()`, `.After()`, `.Times()`, and `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for precise call order and cardinality control.
- Mock strictness controls (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`) provide more intuitive options for how uninteresting calls are handled.

For details, see the [Mocking Reference](docs/reference/mocking.md) and the guide on [Advanced Mocking Patterns and Best Practices](guides/core-workflows/mocking-best-practices.mdx).

### Improved Assertion Flexibility
New assertion facilities enable clearer and more expressive test code:

- Predicate assertions using `AssertionResult` allow custom success/failure messages, improving debugging clarity.
- Support for matchers with `EXPECT_THAT` offers rich matching conditions, integrating seamlessly with mocks and tests.
- Better handling of floating-point comparisons and exception assertions enhances coverage for complex scenarios.

Learn more from the [Assertions Reference](api-reference/core-testing-api/assertions.mdx) and the guide on [Mastering Assertions and Matchers](guides/core-workflows/assertions-and-matchers.mdx).

### Death Tests Enhancements
Death tests, designed to verify that code fails safely, have new features and best practices:

- Addition of the "threadsafe" death test style for safer execution in multithreaded environments.
- Improved handling of mocks within death tests to prevent leaks and unintended side effects.
- Guidance on structuring death tests and isolating death-related scenarios.

Please see the [Death Tests Guide](guides/core-workflows/death-tests.mdx) and the [Advanced Guide](docs/advanced.md#death-tests) for usage patterns.

### Event Listener and Environment APIs
Test lifecycle integration has been strengthened with APIs for event listeners and global environments:

- New interfaces for creating custom test event listeners allow monitoring and reacting to detailed test events.
- Global test environments can now be added programmatically for setup/teardown outside individual tests and suites.

This facilitates integration with CI/CD pipelines and enables custom reporting. See the [Custom Event Listeners & Test Environment Hooks](api-reference/advanced-and-internal-utilities/custom-test-event-listeners.mdx).

## How to Adopt New Features

1. **Review the sections above** to identify relevant enhancements aligned to your testing needs.
2. **Explore the linked detailed documentation and examples** to understand the APIs and patterns.
3. **Refactor or augment your existing tests** to take advantage of richer parameterization or mock controls.
4. **Leverage new assertion styles and death test improvements** to write clearer and more robust failure checks.
5. **Implement custom listeners or environments as needed** to integrate deeper with your build and test infrastructure.

<Tip>
Keep your test suites modular by using parameterized and typed tests, and rely on strict mock controls to improve maintainability and reduce flakiness.

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent name collisions and undefined behavior.
- When defining mock methods with complex argument types involving commas, wrap argument lists in extra parentheses or use type aliases.
- Be cautious with the initialization order in test fixtures; prefer `SetUp()` over constructors for assertions that can fail.
- When writing death tests, isolate side effects and understand that in-memory changes are not propagated back to the parent process.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to conditionally skip tests with clear messaging rather than disabling them indefinitely.

See the [GoogleTest FAQ](docs/faq.md) and [Getting Started Troubleshooting](getting-started/troubleshooting/common-setup-issues.mdx) for full details.
