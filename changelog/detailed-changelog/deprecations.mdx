# Deprecations & Removal Notices

This page provides early warnings and structured information regarding deprecated APIs, features, or platform supports in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Understanding these notices empowers you to proactively plan migrations, manage technical debt, and avoid unexpected disruptions.

---

## Purpose of This Page

The 'Deprecations & Removal Notices' documentation is focused on informing you — the user — about upcoming changes that may impact your test codebase. It clearly explains **what is deprecated or removed**, the associated **timelines**, and guides to help you **migrate** away from these obsolete constructs smoothly.

Unlike general release notes or changelogs, this page emphasizes early warnings so you can adapt before breaking changes take effect.

---

## Why Pay Attention to Deprecations?

Deprecations signal that certain APIs or features will be phased out in the future, often replaced by improved alternatives. Ignoring these warnings risks being caught off guard by removals or behavioral shifts.

By consulting this page regularly, you can:

- Avoid technical debt by planning updates at convenient times.
- Prevent compile or runtime errors caused by removed constructs.
- Leverage new, better-supported APIs and features.

---

## What is Deprecated or Removed?

### Deprecated APIs and Features

GoogleTest and GoogleMock occasionally mark APIs or features as deprecated when better options exist or underlying implementations change. These include:

- Legacy mocking macros and interfaces superseded by newer, cleaner APIs.
- Flags or command-line options replaced by improved configurations.
- Compilation targets, platform support, or environment assumptions that become obsolete.

### Platform Support Changes

Support for specific platforms or compilers may be deprecated due to lack of usage or maintenance burden.

### Behavioral Changes with Deprecation

Some deprecations may accompany changes in default behaviors (e.g., stricter warnings, modified logging).

---

## Deprecation Timelines and Removal Dates

GoogleTest and GoogleMock adhere to a deprecation policy that includes:

- **Advance Notice:** Deprecations are announced well ahead of removal.
- **Grace Period:** Deprecated elements continue to function for at least one major release cycle.
- **Removal:** Deprecated elements are removed or disabled in a future major release.

Ensure to track official release notes for precise dates.

### Migration Strategies

To ease migration:

- Prefer **using new APIs** and avoid relying on deprecated constructs in new code.
- Use the **migration guides** linked in release notes for step-by-step instructions.
- Apply **compiler warnings** or **tests** to detect deprecated usage early.

---

## Managing Deprecated APIs in Your Tests

Here are actionable recommendations to handle deprecated features:

1. **Audit** your test code periodically for deprecated API usage.
2. **Refactor** usage to new APIs promptly. For example:

   - Replace old-style `MOCK_METHODn` macros with the newer variadic `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
   - Transition to recommended `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` syntaxes.
3. **Update build flags and environments** per deprecation notices.
4. **Follow migration documentation** specific to version upgrades.

---

## Example Deprecation Notice: Moving to C++17

GoogleTest now requires C++17 as a minimum standard. Older standards are deprecated and no longer supported.

- **What to do:** Ensure your build system uses at least C++17.
- **Impact:** Builds targeting older C++ standards will fail.
- **Timeline:** Effective since version 1.10.0.

---

## Example Deprecation Notice: Old Macros

The legacy `MOCK_METHODn` family of macros is deprecated in favor of the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro, which offers clearer syntax and better support for modern C++ features.

- **Migrating:** Update your mocks as follows:

```cpp
// Old style
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// New style
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int));
```

- **Removal:** Legacy macros will be dropped in a future major release.

---

## Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues

If your build fails due to deprecated features:

- Check the **compiler errors or warnings** for exact deprecated symbols.
- Review your mock class definitions for usage of outdated macros or patterns.
- Verify your build flags enforce the correct C++ standard.
- Consult the **migration guides** for recommendations.

## Resources and Next Steps

- **Migration Guides:** See the [Upgrade & Migration Guides](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/breaking-changes-migrations/upgrade-guides.md) for stepwise update instructions.
- **Breaking Changes:** Understand impacts in the [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/breaking-changes-migrations/breaking-changes.md) page.
- **Release Notes:** Always consult recent release notes to catch late deprecations.
- **Mocking Reference:** Review [Mocking Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/mocking.md) for updated mocking API usage.

## How This Page Fits Into the Documentation

This page is part of the detailed changelog group, dedicated to proactive user guidance on deprecated and removed features. It complements the breaking changes documentation — which describes the immediate impacts — and upgrade guides — which provide practical steps. It also cross-links to core mocking and assertion references for effective transition across versions.

<Tip>
Always prefer to update your test projects promptly upon receiving a deprecation notice to maintain compatibility and leverage improvements.
</Tip>

<Note>
Deprecations only affect APIs and features explicitly marked. If functionality is not documented here or in core release notes as deprecated, it is safe to use.
