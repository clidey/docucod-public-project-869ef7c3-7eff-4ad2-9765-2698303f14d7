# Bug Fixes and Patches

This page documents the resolved defects and applied patches specifically within the GoogleMock component of GoogleTest. The focus remains on the mocking functionalities, ensuring users and teams relying on mock-based testing are aware of recent stability and correctness improvements.

## Understanding the Importance of Bug Fixes

In complex C++ testing scenarios, especially those involving mock objects, reliability and accuracy of the mocking framework are critical. Patches and bug fixes ensure that expectations, default actions, matchers, call sequences, and test verifications behave as intended under all edge cases. This section helps you stay informed about fixes that may affect your testing workflows.

## Common Bug Categories Addressed

### 1. Expectation Matching and Call Behavior
- Fixed issues where expectations with multiple actions (`WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly`) did not correctly handle exhaustion of `WillOnce` clauses, leading to incorrect default actions.
- Resolved bugs in the handling of excessive calls that exceed the designated `Times` cardinality, ensuring accurate failure reporting and default behavior invocation.
- Corrected problems when `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` specifications had invalid or multiple conflicting clauses (e.g., multiple `.With()` or `.Times()`), improving error diagnostics.

### 2. Sequence and Ordering Semantics
- Patches enforcing strict call order when sequences (`InSequence`) and pre-requisite expectations (`After`) are combined, preventing intermittent false-positive or false-negative failures.
- Ensured retired expectations via `.RetiresOnSaturation()` transition correctly, avoiding lingering active states that could mis-match arguments.

### 3. Verbosity and Diagnostic Messaging
- Enhanced the output for uninteresting and unexpected calls depending on the verbosity flags (`--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error`), providing clearer, actionable warnings.
- Fixed issues where stack traces or function call details were omitted or incomplete in warning messages, promoting easier debugging.

### 4. Object Lifetime and Leak Detection
- Improved detection of leaked mocks alongside their usage contexts in test suites and cases, empowering users to catch lifetime management issues early.
- Added support to mark mocks as allowed to leak safely (`Mock::AllowLeak`), preventing false leak reports during multi-threaded or deferred deletion test scenarios.

### 5. Support for Complex Argument Types and Matchers
- Addressed bugs with incomplete or non-copyable types by refining matcher registrations and prints.
- Fixed compiler warnings and runtime errors associated with macro expansions or redeclared methods, especially in Windows environments.

## Workflow Impact Notes

### For Users Writing Expectations:
- Expect more precise enforcement and helpful diagnostics when specifying multiple expectations on the same mock method.
- Pay special attention to the order of `EXPECT_CALL` declarations as newer expectations override older ones.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` intentionally to avoid sticky expectations causing unintended call matches.

### For Users Controlling Mock Behavior:
- Default actions set by `ON_CALL` now interact more predictably with explicit `EXPECT_CALL` behaviors.
- Verbosity levels influence the amount of detail seen in warnings and informative logs. Set `--gmock_verbose=info` during debugging for full tracebacks.

### For Test Stability and Maintenance:
- The fixes reduce flaky test failures related to ordering, call counts, and unexpected default actions.
- Leak detection and diagnostics improvements aid continuous integration stability.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always define mock expectations before exercising the code that invokes the mocks.
- When working with sequences, group expectations with `InSequence` or use `After` for partial orders.
- Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` to modulate how uninteresting calls are treated, depending on your test needs.
- Reset or verify mocks explicitly using `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` when lifetime or ownership is complex.
- For complex or move-only types in mocks, prefer lambdas or functors in actions for safer and clearer test code.

## Troubleshooting Section

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues with Mocking">
<Accordion title="Unexpected Call Failures">
When a mock method call fails due to argument mismatches or unexpected calls, enable verbose output with `--gmock_verbose=info`. Review the detailed call logs and stack traces to locate which expectation was expected and why the call failed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Excessive Call Errors">
If a mock function is called more times than anticipated, double-check the cardinality in your `EXPECT_CALL`. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations once saturated, preventing stickiness that causes failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting Call Warnings">
To suppress or treat uninteresting call warnings as errors, switch between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers around your mock class. If you intentionally want to allow calls without expectations, create a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Leaks Detected at Program Exit">
If leak errors are reported, verify that all mock objects are properly destroyed. Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` for mocks that intentionally persist beyond test lifetimes.
</Accordion>
