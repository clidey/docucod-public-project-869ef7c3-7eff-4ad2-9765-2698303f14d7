# Upgrade Strategies & Best Practices

Upgrade Strategies & Best Practices guide you through smooth, effective transitions between versions of GoogleTest, ensuring your test environments remain stable, performant, and up-to-date. This page focuses on what users need to consider when upgrading, covering dependency handling, flag and configuration changes, and how to troubleshoot typical hurdles encountered during migration.

---

## 1. Understanding Upgrade Context

Upgrading GoogleTest can involve changes in dependencies, compiler requirements, default behaviors, and runtime flags that may affect your existing tests. Being aware of these aspects ensures that upgrades bring improvements without introducing unexpected failures or frustrations.

### Key Upgrade Motivations:
- Adopt newer C++ standards and toolchain optimizations
- Leverage improved test framework capabilities and bug fixes
- Align with contemporary platform support and security enhancements

### Common User Goals:
- Minimize disruption to current test suites
- Maintain test stability and accuracy
- Simplify dependency updates and build system integrations

---

## 2. Dependency Management and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest's version 1.17.0 and later require a C++17-compliant compiler. Before upgrading, confirm that your build environment meets this requirement to avoid compilation errors.

### Upgrade Preparation Checklist:
- Verify your C++ compiler supports C++17 or higher.
- Update CMake or Bazel build configurations to use compatible toolchain settings.
- Confirm thread model and platform support align with the new GoogleTest requirements.

#### Example: Updating CMake Minimum Version

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

<Tip>
Keep your build tools fresh to avoid subtle incompatibilities, especially when integrating newer GoogleTest versions.
</Tip>

## 3. Handling Flag and Configuration Changes

Some flags and internal configurations have evolved, impacting test execution or mocking behavior. Notably:

- **Abseil Library Adoption**: Recent GoogleTest versions leverage Abseil (absl) for foundational utilities, so the integration may affect transitive dependencies.
- **Flag Naming and Defaults**: Flags for verbosity (`--gmock_verbose`) or behavior control might have updated defaults or names.

### Best Practices for Flag Updates:
- Review all custom launch parameters and scripts invoking your tests.
- Align your build and test runners with the new flag syntax and defaults.
- Set verbosity levels intentionally to balance diagnostics and noise.

<Tip>
Use `--gmock_verbose=warning` to catch important warnings without excessive output during upgrades.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Upgrade Patterns and User Workflows

Users upgrading typically follow these patterns:

### Step 1: Dependency Verification
Ensure your compiler and build system support the new GoogleTest dependencies.

### Step 2: Controlled Integration
Incorporate GoogleTest as a subtree, submodule, or via `FetchContent` in CMake or appropriate Bazel WORKSPACE modifications.

### Step 3: Initial Build and Test Run
Attempt a build and run tests, capturing any failures or warnings triggered by the upgrade.

### Step 4: Addressing Failures
Analyze failures, focusing on:
- Deprecated or removed APIs.
- Changed semantics for expectations or mocking behavior.
- Build or linkage errors caused by dependency mismatches.

### Step 5: Flag and Behavior Tuning
Adjust runtime flags or test code to align with new expected frameworks behaviors.

### Step 6: Validation and Full Integration
Conduct broader CI runs, monitor test flakiness, and finalize upgrade.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Upgrade Issues

### Compilation Errors
- **Issue**: Compiler does not recognize C++17 features.
- **Solution**: Confirm and update compiler version; adjust `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`.

### Linking Problems
- **Issue**: Undefined symbols related to GoogleTest or GoogleMock.
- **Solution**: Verify inclusion and link ordering of GoogleTest libraries; review usage of the combined `gtest_main` or separate main libraries.

### Runtime Failures or Unexpected Behavior
- **Issue**: Tests fail due to stricter mock call verifications or changed default behaviors.
- **Solution**: Review updated `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and expectations usage; audit for dependent mock and stub behavior differences.

### Flag Mismatches
- **Issue**: Flags such as `--gmock_verbose` ignored or behaving unexpectedly.
- **Solution**: Verify flag spelling and placement; consult changes in flag handling in the latest documentation.

<Note>
Early testing environments might require explicit cleanup of old GoogleTest artifacts to remove stale binaries or cached object files causing conflicts.
</Note>

## 6. Best Practices for Future-proof Upgrades

- **Automate Environment Checks**: Use scripts or CI to verify compiler versions and build dependencies before upgrading.
- **Incremental Upgrades**: Avoid skipping multiple major versions at once to reduce complexity.
- **Feature Flags**: Isolate use of experimental or new flags behind feature toggles.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Increase verbosity temporarily during upgrades to capture detailed diagnostics.
- **Consult the Community and Docs**: Engage with the GoogleTest community forums and official release notes.

## 7. Resources and Next Steps

- **Latest Release Overview:** Review the official [Latest Release Overview](/changelog/release-history/latest-release) for detailed upgrade notes.
- **Breaking Changes & Migration Notes:** Consult [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](/changelog/breaking-changes-upgrades/breaking-changes) for precise change lists.
- **Installation Methods:** See [Installation Methods](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-methods) for build and configuration guidance.
- **Troubleshooting Common Issues:** Explore diagnostics at [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-test-execution/troubleshooting-common-issues).

<Tip>
Following these best practices will safeguard your upgrade efforts and maximize returns from GoogleTest’s ongoing improvements.
</Tip>

## 8. Summary

Upgrading GoogleTest requires careful attention to compatibility in compiler versions, dependency management, and understanding behavioral changes in testing and mocking frameworks. By systematically verifying requirements, adjusting configurations, and troubleshooting with focused attention, users can confidently reap the benefits of enhancements with minimal disruption. Leveraging referenced guides and community resources completes the upgrade toolkit to achieve stable and modern testing workflows.
