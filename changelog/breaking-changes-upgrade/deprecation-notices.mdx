# Deprecation Notices and Future Removals

Effective and proactive maintenance of your GoogleTest-based code relies on awareness of features and APIs that are deprecated or planned for future removal. This documentation page equips you with clear visibility into these deprecated elements, timelines for their removal, and recommended alternatives to adopt.

---

## Purpose of This Page

This page is dedicated to informing you of:

- **Features and APIs marked as deprecated**
- **Schedules and plans for their removal from upcoming releases**
- **Guidance on preferred replacements and migration strategies**

By engaging with this information early, you can ensure your tests remain robust, compatible, and future-proof.

## Current Deprecations

### Deprecated Macros and APIs

#### `INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P`
- **Status:** Deprecated
- **Context:** This macro for instantiating parameterized test suites has been superseded.
- **Recommended Alternative:** Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` instead.
- **Impact:** Continues to work in current versions but will generate compiler warnings.

#### `TYPED_TEST_CASE` and `TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`
- **Status:** Deprecated
- **Context:** Older macros for typed and type-parameterized test suites.
- **Recommended Alternative:** Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` respectively.
- **Impact:** Same as above; migrating avoids warnings and future breakage.

#### `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`
- **Status:** Deprecated
- **Recommended Alternative:** Prefer `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

---

### Deprecated Test Case API

GoogleTest is replacing the legacy usage of "Test Case" terminology with "Test Suite" to modernize and align with common industry language.

- **Legacy Methods:** `SetUpTestCase()` and `TearDownTestCase()`
- **Modern Methods:** `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`

**Migration Tip:**
Replace all use of legacy test-case setup/teardown methods with the suite equivalents and ensure consistent access modifiers (see related [Writing Unit Tests](guides/core-workflows/writing-unit-tests.md)).

---

## Removal Timeline and Compatibility Policy

Features and APIs marked as deprecated will remain supported and functional for at least one minor release cycle to allow users sufficient migration time.

GoogleTest requires C++17 or higher, and ongoing evolutions may leverage this baseline to discontinue deprecated APIs in favor of cleaner, more maintainable alternatives.

You will be notified via release notes and this documentation of imminent removals, enabling scheduled updates rather than last-minute fixes.

## Recommended Migration Paths and Best Practices

### Transition Macros
Use these macros instead of deprecated ones:

| Deprecated Macro           | Use Instead               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| `INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P` | `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` |
| `TYPED_TEST_CASE`         | `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`         |
| `TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`       | `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`       |
| `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`| `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`|
| `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`| `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`|


### Modern Test Suite Setup
Replace legacy test-case setup and teardown methods:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // setup logic here
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // teardown logic here
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // per-test setup
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // per-test teardown
  }
};
```

### Avoid Using Deprecated Naming Conventions
Rename all instances that contain "TestCase" to "TestSuite" in macros, function names, and test naming.

### Continuous Integration
Update your CI pipelines and build scripts to favor modern macros to avoid warnings and prepare for eventual removals.

## Frequently Asked Concerns

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ">
<Accordion title="Why has GoogleTest deprecated the 'Test Case' terminology?">
GoogleTest aligns with the industry standard nomenclature by adopting "Test Suite" in place of the formerly used "Test Case". This change makes test code clearer to readers and compatible with expectations from wider testing communities.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does my existing test code using deprecated macros still work?">
Yes, for now. Deprecated macros and APIs are maintained for at least one release cycle with warnings, providing ample time to migrate. However, to maintain clean builds and avoid compatibility issues, migrate as soon as possible.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I identify deprecated macro usage in my codebase?">
Run your build with `-Wdeprecated-declarations` enabled or equivalent flags on your compiler, which will emit warnings where deprecated API usage occurs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are there tools available to help with migration?">
Currently, migration involves manual refactoring guided by this documentation. Due to GoogleTestâ€™s simple API shape, replacements are mostly one-to-one, easing the transition.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where to find detailed upgrade instructions?">
Refer to the [Breaking Changes Overview](../breaking-changes-upgrade/breaking-changes-summary.md) and [Upgrade Guides & Migration Paths](../breaking-changes-upgrade/upgrade-guides.md) in the Changelog section.

## Additional Recommendations

- Avoid underscore characters (`_`) in test suite and test names, as this is reserved for special macros and can cause subtle build or runtime issues.
- Routinely consult the [Releases at a Glance](releases-at-a-glance.md) page for the latest version changes.
- Subscribe to GoogleTest community channels and release announcements to stay informed about future deprecations.

## Summary
This document describes the current deprecated elements within GoogleTest, the approach to their removal, and migration alternatives. By following these guidelines, you ensure your test code remains compatible, healthy, and benefit from the latest features.
