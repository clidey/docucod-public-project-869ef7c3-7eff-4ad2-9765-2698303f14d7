# Breaking Changes Overview

This page delivers a focused summary of all breaking changes introduced in recent GoogleTest releases. It is designed to help developers quickly understand updates that may require **user action**, such as removed features, API modifications, or changed default behaviors. This overview enables you to **assess impact** and **plan migrations efficiently**, targeting the precise code areas that might need adjustments.

---

## Understanding Breaking Changes

As GoogleTest evolves, some updates affect existing tests or integration workflows in ways that are incompatible with previous versions. These breaking changes typically involve:

- Removal of deprecated APIs or features
- Modifications to function signatures or behaviors
- Changes to default flags and runtime configurations

When upgrading to a new major or minor version, reviewing this section ensures your test projects continue to run smoothly.

## How to Use This Overview

1. **Identify which breaking changes apply:** Focus on the changes relevant to the GoogleTest APIs, macros, or behaviors you currently use.
2. **Plan for migration:** Use the detailed change descriptions to scope the necessary code modifications.
3. **Refer to upgrade guides:** For comprehensive migration steps, see the [Upgrade Guides & Migration Paths](./upgrade-guides) page.

## Recent Breaking Changes Highlights

### Version 1.17.0 (Requires C++17)

- **Minimum C++ Standard Raised:** The 1.17.x branch requires a minimum of C++17. Ensure your build environment and project settings are updated accordingly.
- **Dependency on Abseil:** The code base is preparing to depend on Abseil (`absl::string_view` and utilities). Future releases will integrate this dependency, potentially affecting build configurations.

### Deprecated and Removed Features

- **Legacy Test Case API Removal:** GoogleTest has fully transitioned from `TestCase` to `TestSuite`. If your code uses the old APIs or naming, modify it as the legacy aliases are now deprecated.
- **Flag and Macro Changes:** Some internal flags controlling test filtering, output formatting, or death test behavior have changed defaults or are removed.

### Changed API Behaviors

- **Test Registration:** The dynamic test registration mechanism expects updated factory callable signatures, reflecting class template changes.
- **Event Listener API:** Minor interface changes in event listeners require users extending or implementing custom listeners to adjust method signatures or inheritances.

### Default Runtime Behavior

- **Death Test Style:** The default death test style is migrating towards the safer `threadsafe` mode. If tests rely on the legacy `fast` style, adjust flag settings or test code.
- **Test Filtering and Sharding:** Improvements and tweaks to filtering and sharding logic may impact which tests are selected or run in parallel.

## Migration Tips and Best Practices

- **Build Environment Check:** Before upgrading, ensure your compiler supports C++17 or higher. Validate platform compatibility per [Supported Platforms](../../getting-started/setup-and-installation/requirements) documentation.
- **Flag Verification:** Audit your test runs to verify flag values such as `--gtest_death_test_style`, `--gtest_filter`, and others. Update scripts or CI settings accordingly.
- **Test Suite Refactoring:** Replace usage of deprecated `TestCase` names or APIs with `TestSuite` equivalents.
- **Review Custom Extensions:** If you implement event listeners or custom test registration, review the internal API headers to align with updated signatures.
- **Leverage Static Analysis:** Use compiler warnings or static analysis tools to spot deprecated macro usage or signature mismatches caused by updates.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Running After Upgrade

- Verify the project is compiled with C++17 standard or higher.
- Confirm no legacy `TestCase` APIs remain in your test source.
- Check for filters or environment variables that might exclude tests unintentionally.

### Compiler Errors on Registration or Event Listener

- Update test registration callables to match the new factory signature.
- Confirm that event listener overrides match updated method signatures.

### Death Tests Fail or Behave Differently

- Explicitly set `--gtest_death_test_style=fast` if you require legacy behavior.
- Validate test code for thread-safety and compliance with recommended death test patterns.

## Example: Addressing a Breaking Change

For instance, suppose your project recently upgraded to GoogleTest 1.17.0 and your tests fail to build due to missing or changed APIs.

**Action flow:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify C++17 Toolchain">
Ensure your compiler supports and is configured to use at least C++17.
</Step>
<Step title="Update TestSuite API Usage">
Replace deprecated `TestCase` references with `TestSuite`.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Custom Test Registration">
Modify your `RegisterTest` factory functions to match new callable signatures as documented in GoogleTest internal headers.
</Step>
<Step title="Test and Validate">
Rebuild your tests and run them to confirm no runtime or behavioral regressions.
</Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, you mitigate potential risks and align your code with current GoogleTest standards.
