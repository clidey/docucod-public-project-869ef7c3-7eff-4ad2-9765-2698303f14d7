# Bug Fixes & Patches

A summary of resolved defects and stability improvements. This section helps users quickly determine if an update addresses issues relevant to their workflows.

---

## Overview

This page details the officially resolved bugs, stability fixes, and patch-level improvements in the GoogleTest framework. It is intended to help you identify specific fixes that may improve reliability or resolve issues you might have encountered.

Bug fixes documented here refer exclusively to corrections that improve the correctness, robustness, or stability of GoogleTest itselfâ€”not new features or API changes.


## Recent Bug Fixes and Stability Patches

### Defect Resolution Highlights

- **Improved Test Assertion Output**: Several fixes ensure clearer and more informative failure messages, increasing the readability and debuggability of test failures.

- **Enhanced Death Test Robustness**: Stability improvements around death tests (`EXPECT_DEATH`, `ASSERT_DEATH`, etc.) have addressed hangs and segfaults that could occur in multithreaded or complex test environments.

- **Fixed Mocking Edge Cases**: Corrections to mock method expectations and behavior, especially involving move-only types, overloaded methods, and non-trivial actions, provide greater consistency and reduce unexpected test failures.

- **Stability Increases in Parameterized Tests**: Bug fixes in value- and type-parameterized tests improve instantiation correctness and prevent spurious test failures or crashes.

- **Platform Compatibility Updates**: Several fixes address platform-specific issues on Windows, Linux, and macOS, including threading and exception handling quirks.

- **Memory Leak and Resource Cleanup**: Resolved several scenarios where mock objects or test fixtures were not cleaned up correctly, leading to resource warnings or leaks in tests.


### Example Fixes

- Prevented crashes when multiple death tests are run in sequence on Linux and Windows.
- Fixed inconsistent detection and reporting of uninteresting mock calls leading to misleading warnings.
- Addressed failures due to missing default constructors in test fixtures causing errors on some compilers.
- Corrected matcher and action runtime behavior concerning evaluation order and internal caching.
- Resolved failures in XML and JSON test report generation related to test property annotations.


## Best Practices After Applying Fixes

- **Update Test Suites**: After patch upgrades, review your test suites for any previously flaky tests, as many have known causes now fixed.

- **Verify Death Tests Carefully**: Consider running death tests with the new stability improvements; adjust your use of flags such as `death_test_style` if you experienced prior hangs.

- **Review Mock Expectations**: The fixes around mocking encourage that expectations are set _before_ exercise, and proper cleanup is observed. Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` where destruction timing is uncertain.

- **Confirm Parameterized Test Instantiation**: To ensure all your parameterized tests are properly instantiated and recognized, verify your usage of `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` matches the updated conventions.


## Troubleshooting and Support

If issues persist after applying fixes:

- Use the verbose flags for GoogleTest and gMock (`--gtest_brief=1`, `--gmock_verbose=info`) to gain detailed output.

- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-steps-validation/common-setup-issues) and [Mocking Problems](/faq/troubleshooting/mocking-problems) guides.

- Review the [Bug Fix Notes](/changelog/improvements-fixes/bug-fix-notes) page for the latest patch updates.

- Reach out to the community or GoogleTest maintainers if you encounter new or unresolved problems.


## How to Access These Fixes

- Update to the latest GoogleTest release that includes these patches. See the [Latest Release Notes](/changelog/release-highlights/latest-release) for specific version details.

- Check out the stable branch of the GoogleTest GitHub repository:

  ```bash
  git clone --branch main https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  ```
