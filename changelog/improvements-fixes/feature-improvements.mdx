# Feature Improvements

A comprehensive walkthrough of the enhanced functionalities and extended capabilities introduced in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page focuses on key improvements in assertion macros, parameterized and type-based testing patterns, and integration enhancements that empower users to write more expressive, flexible, and maintainable tests.

---

## 1. Assertion Enhancements

GoogleTest continues to enrich its assertion macros with clearer, more powerful checks that simplify verifying complex conditions.

- **Expanded Predicate Assertions**: New predicate-format assertions allow embedding custom failure messages, making diagnostic output more informative and actionable.

- **Enhanced Use of Matchers**: Assertions like `EXPECT_THAT` now leverage a broader set of matchers and support detailed failure explanations, enabling users to verify intricate properties with readable test code.

- **Improved Floating-Point Comparisons**: New and refined macros provide more reliable and precise floating-point equality and near-equality checks, helping catch subtle numerical errors.

### Practical Tips

- Use predicate assertions to express domain-specific test logic clearly.
- Combine matchers for multi-faceted argument validation within single assertions.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(result, AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(100))) << "Result is out of expected range";
```

## 2. Parameterized and Type-Based Testing Improvements

GoogleTest has bolstered its support for writing tests that run across multiple input values and types, minimizing code duplication and maximizing coverage.

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**: New utilities improve naming customization and parameter generation, simplifying test suite instantiation.

- **Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST`, `TYPED_TEST_P`)**: Enhancements include better integration with fixtures, clearer error messages, and streamlined registration of typed test suites.

- **Custom Naming Support**: Users can now provide more descriptive test instance names, improving test readability and filtering.

### Usage Flow

1. Define a parameterized fixture or typed test.
2. Generate parameters or type lists with improved utilities.
3. Instantiate the test suites with custom names to aid discoverability.

### Example

```cpp
typedef ::testing::Types<int, double> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, DoesSomething) {
  TypeParam value = static_cast<TypeParam>(1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(FunctionUnderTest(value));
}
```

## 3. Integration Enhancements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock's integration points have been extended and refined, promoting smoother development workflows.

- **Mocking Framework Updates**: The GoogleMock framework now supports more intuitive and robust mock definition and usage patterns, emphasizing ease of expressing expectations, sequencing, and default behaviors.

- **Strictness and Behavior Control**: Introducing or improving `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` templates to manage uninteresting calls with greater granularity, aiding in prioritizing test maintenance and clarity.

- **Sequencing and Ordering Expectations**: Better constructs for defining call order and partial sequences help users write more precise interaction-based tests.

- **Support for Move-Only Types**: Mocking support extended to methods handling move-only objects such as `std::unique_ptr`, simplifying modern C++ usage.

### Best Practices

- Use `ON_CALL` extensively to define default mock behavior without over-specifying expectations.
- Sprinkle `EXPECT_CALL` only where call verification is essential to reduce brittleness.
- Employ `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` variants thoughtfully to manage warnings and failures arising from unexpected calls.

### Example

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
EXPECT_CALL(nice_mock, DoSomething()).Times(1);
```

## 4. Practical Examples and User Workflows

This page guides you through typical user journeys incorporating these feature improvements:

- Writing expressive assertions that pinpoint failure causes.
- Creating robust parameterized tests that cover real-world scenarios with varied inputs and types.
- Defining mocks with controlled expectations to isolate units effectively.
- Managing test and mock object lifecycle, including forced verification and leak detection.

### Troubleshooting Common Pain Points

- Understand uninteresting vs unexpected mock calls to avoid false positives.
- Utilize verbose flags such as `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain insights during failing tests.
- Tackle move-only types in mock methods by using lambdas or specifying actions carefully.

## 5. Summary of Updated API Elements

- **New and enhanced macros:** Improved `EXPECT_THAT`, predicate assertions, `MATCHER_P` modifiers.
- **Mocking templates:** Enhancements in `NiceMock<T>`, `NaggyMock<T>`, `StrictMock<T>` with constructor argument forwarding.
- **Action and Matcher facilities:** Facilities to write custom actions and matchers more succinctly.
- **Sequence and expectation control:** Refined `InSequence`, `After`, and cardinality clauses.

### Appendix: Sample Mock Declaration With New Style

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

### Appendix: Using `EXPECT_CALL` With Sequences

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
}
```

### Appendix: Controlling Mock Strictness

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoThis());
```

This suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls, making your tests less noisy.
