# New Features & Enhancements

Explore the latest notable additions and refinements to GoogleTest’s capabilities that empower you to write more expressive, flexible, and efficient tests. This document highlights new features, advances in assertions and matchers, enhanced parameterized test support, and expanded platform or tool integrations. Understanding these improvements will help you plan your adoption and unlock greater utility from the framework.

---

## 1. Feature Additions

### 1.1 Enhanced Assertions and Matchers

GoogleTest continues to evolve its assertion library and matchers, offering improved expressiveness and precision for your tests:

- **Expanded Matcher Set**: New built-in matchers facilitate more complex argument validations, supporting richer semantic checks without requiring custom matcher implementations.
- **Improved Assertion Messaging**: Failure messages are clearer and more informative, helping you quickly diagnose test failures with contextual data.

#### Usage Scenario
Imagine you want to verify that a function under test returns a collection containing specific elements matching complex criteria. The new matchers let you concisely express these expectations, improving test readability and maintainability.

### 1.2 Parameterized Test Support Enhancements

Parameterization in tests has been streamlined:

- **More Flexible Parameter Generators**: Updated parameter generator functions let you produce values more dynamically and combine multiple parameter spaces effortlessly.
- **Custom Naming Schemes**: Expanded support for user-defined name generators enables better test case naming for parameterized tests, improving test output clarity.

#### Adoption Tip
Whenever you use `TEST_P` or `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`, leverage the new generator capabilities and custom name functions to maximize parameter test expressiveness and traceability.

### 1.3 Introduction of New Platforms and Tools Support

GoogleTest broadens its supported ecosystem:

- **Additional Compiler Integrations**: Support for new versions and compilers ensures compatibility and performance.
- **Extended Platform Coverage**: New OS environments are officially supported, aligned with the Foundational C++ Support Policy.

<Info>
Refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://google.github.io/googletest/overview/features-integration/supported-platforms.html) page for detailed compatibility and prerequisites.

## 2. Enhancements to GoogleMock Integration

Though primarily focused on GoogleTest, noteworthy enhancements in mocking complement the testing experience:

- Refined control over mock method behaviors with `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` for better behavioral specificity.
- Strengthened support for strictness levels (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`), allowing more precise management of uninteresting and unexpected calls.

<Note>

</Note>

## 3. Planning Your Adoption

To effectively upgrade your testing infrastructure:

1. **Review the Latest Assertions and Matchers**: Enhance existing tests by integrating new matchers for clearer intent and stronger checks.
2. **Leverage Extended Parameterized Testing**: Simplify data-driven testing patterns and generate informative test names.
3. **Ensure Platform Compatibility**: Confirm your toolchain and OS environments align with new support declarations.
4. **Consult Migration Guides**: When upgrading, check for any breaking changes or deprecated features detailed in the [Migration Guides](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/migrations-breaking-changes/migration-guides.html).

<Tip>
Regularly consult the main [GoogleTest Changelog](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/version-history/changelog-latest.html) to stay updated with ongoing enhancements and fixes.

### Example: Using New Parameterized Test Naming

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {
  // Test code here...
};

// Custom name generator for parameters
std::string CustomName(
    const testing::TestParamInfo<FooTest::ParamType>& info) {
  return "Param_" + std::to_string(info.param);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    CustomInstantiation,
    FooTest,
    testing::Values(1, 2, 3),
    CustomName);

TEST_P(FooTest, SampleTest) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}
```

This approach yields descriptive test case names such as `CustomInstantiation/FooTest.SampleTest/Param_1` facilitating test filtering and reporting.

### Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Common Pitfall**: Avoid over-specifying `EXPECT_CALL` in mocks. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and restrict `EXPECT_CALL` to critical interactions.
- **Performance Tip**: For large suites, reuse shared test fixtures and consider test sharding to optimize run time.
- **Assertion Strategy**: Use new expressive matchers to write assertions that provide clear failure diagnostics.
