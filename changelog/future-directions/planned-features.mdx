# Planned Features & Integrations

Explore the near-term roadmap for GoogleTest and GoogleMock, providing insight into upcoming features, integrations, and significant changes designed to improve your testing workflows. This page helps you anticipate and plan for evolving capabilities such as new dependencies, enhanced behaviors, and architectural improvements.

---

## 1. Abseil Integration

One of the key upcoming changes is the introduction of a dependency on the Abseil C++ libraries (absl). By leveraging Abseil's collection of reusable C++ libraries, GoogleTest aims to enhance consistency, maintainability, and feature richness. 

- **User Impact**: Projects using GoogleTest will need to incorporate Abseil as a dependency to build and run tests.
- **Planning Tips**: Prepare your build environment to fetch and link Abseil, and follow any updated build or integration instructions.
- **Benefits**: Improved portability and additional utility functions drawn from Abseil's robust implementations will lead to better cross-platform support and cleaner internal code.

## 2. Enhanced Mocking Capabilities

Future releases will continue refining GoogleMock's ability to handle complex mocking scenarios with greater ease:

- Expanded support for move-only types and improving mock method qualifiers to match evolving C++ standards.
- More intelligent default behavior policies to reduce verbose setup and increase test maintainability.
- Improved diagnostics and verbosity controls to give deeper insights during test failures or mock call trace inspection.

These improvements will help you create precise, maintainable mock definitions and expectations with less boilerplate.

## 3. Upgraded User Workflow and Tooling

Anticipate enhancements to the user experience that focus on streamlining test definition, execution, and debugging:

- Smoother integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock with modern C++ build systems and continuous integration workflows.
- More informative warnings and error messages, helping you identify causes without extra guesswork.
- Additional helper utilities and macros to simplify common testing patterns.

By adopting these enhancements, your testing pipeline becomes more robust and developer-friendly.

## 4. API Stabilization and Deprecations

The roadmap embraces tightening API contracts, meaning some legacy features, macros, or behaviors may be deprecated:

- Migration paths for deprecated mock method macros will be provided with detailed guidance.
- Encouragement to adopt newer idioms, qualifiers, and expectations syntax reflecting modern C++ practice.

Plan to update your tests by referring to the related migration and breaking changes documentation to maintain compatibility with the latest versions.

## 5. Cross-Platform and Ecosystem Integration

Further improvements will be made to platform detection, portability layers, and ecosystem/toolchain support:

- Better integration with Windows, macOS, Linux, embedded, and mobile platforms.
- Enhanced flag management and feature toggling to adapt tests based on platform capabilities.

This ensures GoogleTest maintains its promise of reliable, consistent behavior across diverse development environments.

## Practical Recommendations

- Monitor build and dependency changes carefully as Abseil integration might affect your project setup.
- Keep an eye on the breaking changes and migration documentation for smooth upgrades.
- Leverage new verbosity and diagnostics enhancements to debug complex mocks more effectively.
- Take advantage of improving core mocking features to simplify your tests and reduce maintenance overhead.
