# Compatibility Matrix & Platform Support

This page provides a clear and concise summary of platform and compiler requirements for each GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. It serves as a quick reference to ensure that users' environments match the necessary configuration before upgrading or building the framework. Additionally, it includes important notes on C++ standard requirements and any major dependency changes introduced in various releases.

---

## Purpose and User Value

When upgrading GoogleTest or integrating it into your project, knowing whether your platform and compiler are supported is crucial to avoid build failures or runtime issues. This page empowers you to quickly verify compatibility without delving into detailed release notes.

By focusing on what you need to check — the supported operating systems, compilers, C++ standards, and relevant dependencies — this page helps you confidently plan upgrades and achieve smooth integration.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest and GoogleMock officially support major desktop operating systems including:

- Linux
- Windows (Desktop and MinGW)
- macOS

Embedded platforms and others are supported to varying extents where feasible, but may have limitations.

For each release, verify that your target platform is explicitly supported by checking this compatibility matrix.

---

## Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest builds require modern C++ compilers that support at least the C++17 standard. Supported compilers include:

- GCC (versions that fully support C++17)
- Clang (versions that fully support C++17)
- MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or above)

For MSVC, GoogleTest requires at least Visual C++ 2015 (version 19.0), but recommends newer releases for improved compatibility.

Ensure your compiler matches these minimum versions to successfully compile the framework.

---

## C++ Standard Version

Beginning with recent releases, GoogleTest mandates a minimum C++17 standard.

- This reflects the use of modern C++ features internally and aligns with Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy.
- Set your build system (e.g., CMake) to require C++17 or later using commands such as `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`.

Older standards (C++11 or C++14) are not supported in current GoogleTest releases.

---

## Major Dependency Changes

Some releases introduce or update dependencies, notably:

- Integration with the [Abseil](https://abseil.io/) libraries for better portability and feature detection.
- RE2 regular expression library used with Abseil-enabled builds.

If your build environment does not include these dependencies or uses conflicting versions, refer to specific release notes for guidance.

## Quick Reference Matrix

| Release Version | Release Date | Platforms Supported       | Minimum C++ Standard | Recommended Compilers                     | Major Dependency Notes                 |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1.17.0          | 2023-05-10   | Linux, Windows, macOS    | C++17               | GCC >= 7, Clang >= 6, MSVC >= 2017 U3  | Abseil integration, RE2 required     |
| 1.16.0          | 2021-11-15   | Linux, Windows, macOS    | C++11               | GCC >= 5, Clang >= 3.8, MSVC >= 2015   | Legacy compiler support ends         |
| Earlier versions | Various      | Linux, Windows, macOS    | C++11 or C++14       | Varying older compiler support         | See archived release notes           |

## Platform and Compiler Feature Detection

GoogleTest and GoogleMock internally use platform and compiler feature detection macros to adapt to the environment. These include:

- Detection of POSIX thread support (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`).
- Support for exceptions (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`).
- Availability of RTTI (`GTEST_HAS_RTTI`).
- Stream redirection support used for death tests and output capturing.

This automatic detection generally requires no user action, but build configurations or unusual environments may require you to define or override some macros.

---

## CMake and Bazel Integration Notes

Both CMake and Bazel build systems are fully supported on all major platforms.

- CMake requires version 3.14 or later particularly when using `FetchContent` to incorporate GoogleTest.
- Specify C++17 standard in your project or via `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to ensure compatibility.
- On Windows using Visual Studio, watch for your runtime linkage (`/MD` vs `/MT`) to avoid linker errors; the `gtest_force_shared_crt` flag can help.

Confirm your build environment meets these criteria for a smooth setup.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors Related to Compiler Versions:** Confirm your compiler is updated to meet the minimum requirements.
- **C++ Standard Mismatch:** Verify build flags specify C++17 or later explicitly.
- **Dependency Conflicts:** Ensure no conflicting versions of Abseil or RE2 in your build environment.
- **Unsupported Platforms:** Some embedded or exotic platforms might need additional configuration or might be unsupported.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting) and [Build System Integration](../../guides/integration-and-best-practices/build-system-integration) pages for detailed help.

---

## Practical Tips for Users

- Always check this matrix before upgrading to ensure your environment is supported.
- Update your compiler toolchain proactively to avoid breaking changes.
- Use GoogleTest’s `InitGoogleTest()` and `InitGoogleMock()` functions to properly initialize frameworks respecting platform nuances.
- Keep an eye on deprecation notices in release notes for upcoming changes to platform or standard support.
