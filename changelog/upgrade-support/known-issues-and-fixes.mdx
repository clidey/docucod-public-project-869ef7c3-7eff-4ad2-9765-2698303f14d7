# Known Issues and Fixes

This page catalogs known issues, regressions, and their fixes specifically related to recent releases of GoogleTest. It is intended to assist users who encounter unexpected behavior after upgrading or integrating GoogleTest in their projects, providing direct pointers to workarounds and relevant support resources.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest continuously evolves to improve reliability, performance, and usability. Occasionally, changes may introduce regressions or unexpected behavior in specific environments or configurations. This page tracks those known issues for the GoogleTest framework itself—not user test code—and documents resolutions or mitigations.

If you encounter a problem not listed here after upgrading, please consult the [Community Resources](#community-resources) or [Support Channels](#support-channels) sections for assistance.

## Known Issues

### 1. Unexpected Failures in Parameterized Tests Without Instantiation

**Symptoms:**

- When using value-parameterized `TEST_P` or type-parameterized `TYPED_TEST_P` tests but omitting corresponding `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` or `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`, GoogleTest will generate a failing synthetic test in the `GoogleTestVerification` test suite, alerting you that no instantiations were found.

**Cause:**

- This behavior is intentional to catch silently ignored parameterized tests without instantiations, which results in no tests running.

**Workarounds:**

- Ensure parameterized tests are explicitly instantiated using the corresponding `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` macros.
- If the absence of instantiation is intentional (e.g., header-only declarations intended for other binaries), suppress these errors by adding:

```cpp
GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(MyTestSuite);
```

within your namespace.

### 2. Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the Same Test Suite

**Symptoms:**

- GoogleTest generates an error when tests defined with plain `TEST` and fixture-based `TEST_F` macros share the same test suite name.

**Cause:**

- Internally, `TEST` and `TEST_F` require consistent test fixture types. Mixing them violates this constraint.

**Resolution:**

- Rename tests or test suites to ensure that `TEST`-based and `TEST_F`-based tests do not share the same test suite name.

### 3. Failures When Using Legacy Test Case API with Modern Test Suites

**Symptoms:**

- Using legacy APIs or naming conventions involving `TEST_CASE` related macros may cause compilation warnings or runtime errors.

**Background:**

- GoogleTest has deprecated the legacy test case API in favor of the `TestSuite` terminology and APIs.

**Action:**

- Migrate to the current `TestSuite` macros and usages (`TEST_SUITE`, `TEST_F`, etc.).

### 4. Issues with Death Tests in Multi-threaded Environments

**Symptoms:**

- Death tests may hang, crash, or report incorrect results when run in processes with active threads not well controlled.

**Cause:**

- OS-level `fork()` and process creation are known to be problematic with multithreading.

**Recommendations:**

- Name death test suites using the suffix `DeathTest` to ensure they run first.
- Use the `threadsafe` death test style (`--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe`) to improve reliability at the cost of runtime.
- Avoid forking processes with multiple active threads before running death tests.

### 5. Build and Linking Issues

## Fixes and Workarounds

Where applicable, fixes have been incorporated into recent releases or are available as patches. For unresolved issues, consider the following:

- Review your usage of parameterized tests and confirm proper instantiation.
- Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` within the same test suite scope.
- Ensure your test executables use a compatible C++17 (or newer) environment, as GoogleTest now requires C++17.
- When dealing with flaky multithreaded death tests, try the `threadsafe` death test style.
- For issues related to output format or test reporting, verify your flags and environment variables.

## Tips for Upgrading

- Before upgrading, read the [Upgrade Checklist](../upgrade-support/upgrade-checklist.md) to learn about breaking changes and recommended migration steps.
- Test your entire test suite after upgrading, preferably in isolated environments or containers to detect regressions early.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to verify test discovery before running test executions in the new version.
- Read the [Breaking Changes and Migration Guides](../breaking-changes-and-migrations/breaking-changes.md) for detailed impact assessments.

## Example Workaround: Suppressing Uninstantiated Parameterized Test Failure

```cpp
// If your parameterized test suite is intended to be uninstantiated in this binary
GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(MyParamTestSuite);
```

This prevents the synthetic failing test which otherwise is added as a warning to alert missing instantiations.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Missing parameter instantiations:** When writing parameterized tests, always ensure that `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` or `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` is present.
- **Failing to separate death from non-death tests:** Death tests should be grouped in test suites or fixtures with names ending in `DeathTest` for proper handling.
- **Mixing fixture and non-fixture tests in the same suite:** This causes fixture-type conflicts that GoogleTest reports as an error.
- **Assuming legacy APIs:** Always prefer new TestSuite API macros and avoid deprecated legacy test case terms.
