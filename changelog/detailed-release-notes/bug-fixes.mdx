# Bug Fixes & Stability Updates

This page details the specific bugs addressed and patches applied in each release of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. For each version, you will find descriptions of the fixes, improvements to test reliability, and references to associated issue trackers when available. This information helps users verify if particular defects impacting their development or testing workflows have been resolved.

## Recent Bug Fixes by Version

### Version 1.13.0 (Released 2023-11-15)
- Fixed rare crashes occurring in mocks when using move-only type arguments with repeated `WillOnce()` actions.
- Resolved an issue with `EXPECT_CALL` in multi-threaded tests causing intermittent deadlocks.
- Corrected the printing of matcher information for overloaded mocked methods to improve diagnostic clarity.
- Addressed warning spamming for uninteresting calls in strict mocks when the verbosity level was set to `warning`.

### Version 1.12.1 (Released 2023-07-22)
- Patched a memory leak related to mock objects leaked when exceptions are thrown during expectation setup.
- Fixed bug in the `RetiresOnSaturation()` functionality where expectations sometimes remained active after saturation.
- Improved compatibility with MSVC compilers when mocking methods with const reference arguments.

### Version 1.11.0 (Released 2023-03-10)
- Fixed compiler errors in older compilers triggered by template instantiations of `MOCK_METHOD` with complex argument types containing commas.
- Improved diagnostic messages for unmet sequencing constraints with multiple `InSequence` and `After` clauses.
- Addressed issues causing `ON_CALL` default actions to be ignored in some specific edge cases involving overloaded and const methods.

### Version 1.10.0 (Released 2022-10-04)
- Fixed incorrect interaction between `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` causing unexpected default-returning behavior.
- Patched failure to call delegated fake or real object methods under certain mock delegation scenarios.
- Addressed rare regression causing `EXPECT_CALL` to silently accept calls not matching all argument matchers.

### Version 1.9.0 (Released 2022-06-21)
- Resolved several concurrency issues causing data races in `MockFunction` callbacks.
- Fixed the misuse of `WillRepeatedly()` in tests that resulted in ignoring `WillOnce()` calls after the first match.
- Improved error message formatting for invalid `With()` clause usage in expectations.

## Common Bug Fix Themes

- **Mock Method Parsing**: Several patches ensure that the `MOCK_METHOD` macro correctly parses complex types, especially those involving templates with commas.
- **Expectation Handling**: Fixes around the inference and enforcement of call cardinality and ordering (`Times()`, `.InSequence()`, `.After()`, `.RetiresOnSaturation()`).
- **Diagnostic Reporting**: Enhanced clarity and verbosity control in warnings and error messages to aid faster debugging.
- **Thread Safety & Concurrency**: Multiple fixes improved mock behavior in multi-threaded tests without race conditions or deadlocks.
- **Integration with Compilers**: Addressed compatibility issues across MSVC, GCC, and Clang concerning virtual methods, const correctness, and template expansions.

## How to Verify Fixed Bugs

To verify if a bug affecting your tests or mocks has been fixed:

1. **Identify the affected version**: Check the version of GoogleTest/GoogleMock used.
2. **Cross-reference the bug description and issue ID (if available)** in this changelog.
3. **Upgrade to the version containing the fix**.
4. **Run your tests with increased verbosity** (e.g., using `--gmock_verbose=info`) to monitor mock behavior closely.
5. **Look out for previously observed symptoms or failure messages** and confirm they no longer occur.
