## 1. Enhanced Mocking Capabilities with GoogleMock

GoogleTest’s mocking framework, GoogleMock, continues to evolve to offer more expressive, maintainable, and powerful interfaces for creating mocks and configuring their behavior.

### Mock Class Definition with `MOCK_METHOD`
- Create mocks by defining mock classes using the generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro, which supports:
  - Virtual and non-virtual methods
  - Methods with various qualifiers like `const`, `override`, `noexcept`
  - Handling unprotected commas in complex types by wrapping types with parentheses or using typedefs
- Mocking private and protected methods is straightforward by declaring mock methods in the `public:` section, allowing external expectation setting through `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`.

### Support for Overloaded and Template Methods
- Mock overloaded functions seamlessly by defining mocks for each overloaded signature.
- Templates too can be mocked just like ordinary classes.

### Mocking Non-Virtual Methods and Free Functions
- Non-virtual methods can be mocked by defining mock classes unrelated to the real implementation, enabling compile-time dependency injection.
- Free functions require wrapping in interfaces or using `MockFunction` for std::function attributes.

### Mock Behavior and Expectation Configuration
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors without enforcing call expectations — a recommended practice to avoid brittle tests.
- Apply `EXPECT_CALL` to define precise expectations, including
durations, call sequences, and ordering constraints.
- Employ `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls or `StrictMock` to convert such calls into failures, tuning strictness to your testing needs.

### Advanced Techniques
- Delegate calls to fakes, real objects, or parent class methods using `ON_CALL` with lambdas.
- Simplify interfaces by redispatching complex mock methods to friendlier mock methods for ease of use.
- Version consolidation: migrate from legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

### Actions and Matchers in Detail
- Rich set of matchers lets you express precise argument validations.
- Combine matchers, safely cast matchers for type flexibility, and define custom matchers for domain-specific verification.
- Actions support returned references, live value returns, chaining with `DoAll`, and invocations of external functions, methods, or lambdas.
- Specialized actions facilitate asynchronous testing, side-effect mocking (e.g., setting output arguments), and argument capturing for complex verifications.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only for strict expectations.
- Use `NiceMock` or suppress uninteresting calls selectively for cleaner test logs.
- To avoid brittle tests, limit the granularity of expectations, especially ordering constraints.
- For asynchronous patterns, synchronize using notifications within mock actions.
- Avoid mocking concrete classes directly; prefer coding to interfaces to improve test maintainability.

## 2. Improved Assertion and Matcher Integration

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive set of assertion macros and matcher utilities, facilitating clear and maintainable test expressions.

### Assertion Types and Usage
- Standard assertions such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, and their floating-point variants for robust numerical comparisons.
- Predicate and predicate-format assertions to provide detailed failure messages with rich diagnostics.
- Assertions supporting matchers through `EXPECT_THAT` allow descriptive and composable conditions.

### String and Exception Assertions
- String-specific assertions to compare C strings, wide strings, and ignore case as needed.
- Exception assertions verify expected throws with `EXPECT_THROW`, `ASSERT_THROW`, and their related macros.

### Detailed Failure Reporting
- GoogleTest automatically prints detailed error messages, including expected and actual values, with support for user-supplied messages.
- Supports streaming user-friendly representations of complex types using customizable printers.

## 3. Test Lifecycle and Execution Model Enhancements

Internal improvements around test lifecycle control, event listeners, and test isolation further enhance your ability to manage test executions effectively.

### Event Listeners and Custom Output
- Define listeners by subclassing `TestEventListener` or `EmptyTestEventListener` to handle test start/end, results, and other events.
- Easily integrate custom test output, logging, or automated tools by managing listener lifetimes and mastering event forwarding.

### Test Fixture and Suite Setups
- Static shared resources with `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for efficient per-suite resource management.
- Value-parameterized and typed tests enable scalable and expressive testing over varying data and types.

### Controlled Test Runs
- Command-line flags and environment variables allow filtering, repeating, shuffling, and sharding tests.
- Disabled tests can be easily wrapped or enabled temporarily with `DISABLED_` prefixes and `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

## 4. Upgrading and Migration Guidance

- The framework strongly recommends migrating from legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the modern `MOCK_METHOD` interface.
- For breaking changes, refer to the [Breaking Changes & Migration guide](/changelog/breaking-migration/breaking-changes) to smoothly adapt test suites.
- Consult the [Upgrade Guide](/changelog/breaking-migration/upgrade-guide) for detailed steps transitioning to newer GoogleTest versions, including C++17 adoption.

## Code Examples

### Defining a Mock Class
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Transform, (Gadget* g), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Resume, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetTimeOut, (), (override));
};
```

### Setting Expectations
```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Transform(_))
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

### Delegating to a Fake
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(char, DoThis, (int n), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoThat, (const char* s, int* p), (override));

  void DelegateToFake() {
    ON_CALL(*this, DoThis).WillByDefault([this](int n) {
      return fake_.DoThis(n);
    });
    ON_CALL(*this, DoThat).WillByDefault([this](const char* s, int* p) {
      fake_.DoThat(s, p);
    });
  }

 private:
  FakeFoo fake_;
};
```

### Using Matchers in Expectation
```cpp
using ::testing::_;  // wildcard matcher
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(NotNull()));
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Baz(AllOf(Gt(5), Le(10))));
```

### Custom Action Example
```cpp
ACTION(IncrementArg1) {
  return ++(*arg1);
}
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Modify(_))
    .WillOnce(IncrementArg1());
```

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- Avoid overconstraining mocks with excessive `EXPECT_CALL`s; prefer `ON_CALL` where verification isn't needed.
- Suppress warnings on uninteresting calls using `NiceMock` to reduce test log noise.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations with upper-call limits to prevent unexpected failures.
- Structure call order dependencies using `InSequence` or `After` clauses only when necessary to avoid brittle tests.
