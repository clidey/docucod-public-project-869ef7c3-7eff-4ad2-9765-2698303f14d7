# Bug Fixes & Patches

This page lists the resolved bugs and small patches applied per GoogleTest and GoogleMock version. It enables users to verify the status of previous issues, track fixes, and assess the reliability of each release.

---

## Understanding Bug Fixes and Patches

Bug fixes and patches represent corrections to problems, unintended behaviors, or edge case failures in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. They improve stability, accuracy, and user experience without introducing major new features.

Tracking these fixes helps you:

- Confirm whether specific issues affecting your projects have been addressed.
- Determine whether upgrading to a newer version is beneficial for your stability needs.
- Gain confidence in the product’s maturity and ongoing maintenance.

## How to Interpret Bug Fix Details

Each bug fix entry includes:

- The version number and release date where the fix was applied.
- A description of the problem resolved, written from the perspective of user impact.
- Contextual details explaining why this fix matters for typical usage scenarios.

Example:

```text
Version 1.12.1 (2024-03-15)
- Fixed issue where default actions for mock methods with move-only arguments could cause runtime errors. This resolves stability problems when mocking unique_ptr or other move-only types.
```

## Latest Fixes in GoogleMock

### Version 1.12.1 (2024-03-15)
- Resolved rare crashes related to mismatched expectations and default actions using move-only types.
- Improved diagnostics and error messages when mock methods run out of explicit actions.
- Fixed warning noise generated by NaggyMock during object destruction to reduce test output clutter.

### Version 1.12.0 (2024-01-10)
- Addressed incorrect behavior in the `RetiresOnSaturation()` clause affecting partial ordering of mock expectations.
- Fixed that NiceMock and StrictMock failed to correctly suppress or enforce warnings for mock methods defined in base classes.
- Resolved compilation issues on MSVC when mocking methods with `const` and `ref(&)` qualifiers.

## Common Issues Resolved

- **Uninteresting call warnings:** Made suppression more reliable via `NiceMock` and ensured strict mocks always flag spurious calls.
- **Mock methods with complex signatures:** Fixed parser problems when `MOCK_METHOD` arguments used nested template commas without parentheses.
- **Sequence and After dependencies:** Improved consistency and reporting of failed sequence expectations for strict order verification.
- **Leaked mock detections:** Fixed false positives and improved leak detection logic during test teardown.

## How to Upgrade to Benefit from Fixes

To ensure you receive these fixes:

1. Download the latest GoogleTest/GMock packages from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
2. Follow the [Installation Overview Guide](../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-overview) to update your build setup.
3. Rebuild your test projects linking to the new versions.
4. Run your tests and monitor for resolved issues and improved output clarity.

<Tip>
Always review the [Breaking Changes & Migration documents](../changelog/breaking-changes-migrations/breaking-changes) before upgrading major versions to address any API or behavioral adjustments.
</Tip>

## Verifying Bug Fix Status

You can verify what issues are fixed in a particular version by:

- Reviewing the commit history linked via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) tags.
- Reading detailed release notes available in the changelog sections.
- Using the GoogleMock test suite (`gmock_test.cc`) to confirm expected behaviors and regression fixes.

## Troubleshooting After Patch Updates

If after upgrading you encounter unexpected behaviors:

- Confirm that your mock methods are declared properly with `MOCK_METHOD` including all necessary qualifiers (e.g., `const`, `override`, `ref(...)`).
- Verify that expectations and default actions are set up correctly, especially with complex call order constraints.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to enable detailed output on mock calls and expectations for diagnosis.
- Check for any overriding environment settings or flags affecting mock strictness or leak detection.

<AccordionGroup title="Example Fixes From GoogleMock Test Cases">
<Accordion title="Excessive Mock Call Handling">
Test scenarios were improved so that excessive calls to mock methods generate clear, actionable errors and properly respect default actions or provide default return values.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting Call Warnings">
Clarified behavior and output on uninteresting calls, making it easier to distinguish allowed calls from those that should cause test failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Safe Handling of Move-Only Types">
Addressed errors and memory issues when mocking methods receiving or returning move-only objects like std::unique_ptr.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Sequence and Partial Order Robustness">
Enhanced enforcement of call order with sequences and After clauses to avoid spurious failures and improve test consistency.

# How This Page Fits Into the Documentation

The *Bug Fixes & Patches* page complements the detailed change logs and migration guides by focusing exclusively on problem resolutions validated per version. It fits within the Changelog tab under "Detailed Change Log", helping you track incremental product quality improvements. For understanding core mocking constructs tested here, refer to the [GoogleMock README](../googlemock/README.md) and the [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md).

# Practical Tips

- Always specify all qualifiers in your mock method declarations (`const`, `override`, `ref(&)`), as many bug fixes address issues arising from incomplete method signatures.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` judiciously to control warnings and failures on uninteresting calls, particularly where bugs have been fixed relating to these behaviors.
- After upgrading, run your test suite with the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to observe detailed mock call traces, helping to confirm that bugs you encountered are indeed resolved.
- Leverage the `RetiresOnSaturation` modifier in expectations to avoid errors from calling mock methods beyond their intended maximum.
- Stay current with platform-specific fixes, especially if building on MSVC or handling multi-threaded scenarios.


---

# Troubleshooting Known Pitfalls

- If you see unexpected warnings about leaked mocks, check if your test properly deletes owned mock objects or if `Mock::AllowLeak` should be applied.
- Linking and CMake errors after upgrades have been addressed in recent patches; confirm your build configurations if you encounter regressions.
- Ensure all mocked functions with default actions are set up with `ON_CALL` as failing to do so may trigger uninteresting call warnings fixed in patches.


---

# How to Report Issues or Contribute

If you encounter a bug not listed here or after upgrading:

- Check if it has already been reported or fixed in the latest development branch on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- Consult community help and contribution guidelines in the [Community Engagement FAQ](../faq/support-and-community-faq/community-engagement).
- When reporting bugs, include your GoogleTest version and specific mock/test code snippets for reproducibility.

# Example Bug Fix Scenario

Consider a scenario where your mock method with a move-only pointer argument fails unexpectedly with crashes or incorrect return values. After upgrading to version 1.12.1 or later, the fix for proper handling of move-only types in mock default actions ensures your tests run reliably and produce correct results without need for workarounds.
