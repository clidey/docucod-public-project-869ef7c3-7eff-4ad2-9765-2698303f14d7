# All Releases Overview

Explore a comprehensive chronological listing of all GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. This page provides a clear timeline of major, minor, and patch versions with key release dates, notable highlights, and supported C++ standards for each version branch. It serves as a valuable resource for users comparing versions, tracking evolution, or planning upgrades.

## Understanding the Release History

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are delivered together as a unified C++ testing and mocking framework. Each release version follows semantic versioning and reflects enhancements, bug fixes, compatibility updates, and occasionally breaking changes.

This page presents releases in reverse chronological order, enabling users to quickly access the latest version information and trace back through prior versions.

## Key Information Provided per Release

For every listed release, users can expect to find the following details:

- **Version Number:** Clear semantic versioning labels (e.g., 1.17.0)
- **Release Date:** Official date of public release
- **Supported C++ Standard:** Minimum required C++ standard, currently C++17 and above
- **Release Highlights:** Summary of major features, performance improvements, or fixes
- **Links to Detailed Notes:** Direct access to full release notes hosted in the GoogleTest GitHub repository

## Supported C++ Standards Over Time

GoogleTest's recent releases require at least C++17. This ensures modern language features for implementation and usage simplicity. Earlier versions supported C++11 or C++14 but may lack updates or new capabilities introduced post C++17.

When considering an upgrade, verify your project's build environment supports the required C++ standard to avoid integration issues.

## Practical Tips for Version Comparison and Upgrading

- Always refer to the **detailed release notes** linked for each version. They contain important migration instructions, deprecations, and fixed issues.
- Check the **C++ standard requirement** which is a critical compatibility factor.
- Consider upgrading to the latest stable release in your project to take advantage of bug fixes, enhanced performance, and improved API support.
- Before upgrading, test your existing suites with the new version in a controlled environment to identify any integration issues early.
