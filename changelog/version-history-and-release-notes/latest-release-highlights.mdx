## Overview of the Latest Release

The latest release continues to strengthen GoogleTest's core capabilities as a comprehensive C++ testing framework, while enhancing GoogleMock's robust mocking features. This release focuses on refining user experience and ensuring increased reliability and performance.


## Key New Features and Improvements

- **C++17 Minimum Requirement:** This release enforces a minimum C++17 standard, ensuring modern language features and improved compiler support across all supported platforms.

- **Enhanced Build System Support:** Upgrades in the CMake integration streamline building and linking GoogleTest and GoogleMock, reducing configuration complexity and improving discoverability of libraries.

- **GoogleMock Consolidation:** The merger of GoogleTest and GoogleMock repositories into a unified distribution simplifies project setup and dependency management.

- **Improved Test Discovery and Execution:** Automatic test discovery and parallelization have received refinements, delivering faster feedback during development and CI workflows.

- **Expanded Matchers and Assertions:** Users benefit from additional expressive matchers and assertion macros that enable clearer test intent and more precise validation.

- **Better Thread Safety & Stability:** Strengthened thread safety measures help prevent race conditions during test execution, particularly in multithreaded test scenarios.

## Performance Updates

- Test execution speed has been optimized through reduced overhead in test registration and assertion handling.

- Improvements to mock call handling reduce runtime complexity in large test suites with extensive mock interactions.

## Noteworthy Bug Fixes

- Resolution of linker errors related to mixed dynamic/static runtimes on Windows, especially for Visual Studio users.

- Fixes for corner cases causing false positives or negatives in death tests.

- Stability fixes in test fixture setup and teardown processes.

- Patches to address occasional crashes in mock verification during complex call order scenarios.

## Upgrade and Adoption Notes

- Users upgrading to the latest version must ensure their development environment supports **C++17** or later.

- Review build system configurations to align with updated CMake targets and library linking conventions.

- When using GoogleMock, adopt the unified GoogleTest + GoogleMock distribution to benefit from simplified dependencies.

- Consult the [Upgrade Checklist](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/upgrade-checklist.md) for step-by-step guidance.
