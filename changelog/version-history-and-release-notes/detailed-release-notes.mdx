## Latest Releases

### Version 1.14.0 (2024-04-15)
- **New Features:**
  - Introduced enhanced support for mocking overloaded and templated methods with improved syntax handling.
  - Added native multi-argument matcher support in `EXPECT_CALL.With()` for more precise expectation control.
- **Improvements:**
  - Refined verbose logging and diagnostic messages, making unexpected call warnings more actionable.
  - Boosted compatibility with C++20 features without compromising C++17 compliance.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Resolved sporadic leaks detected when using `NaggyMock` with complex lifecycle scenarios.
  - Fixed a regression where `RetiresOnSaturation()` unexpectedly allowed extra calls on certain cardinalities.

### Version 1.13.0 (2023-12-10)
- **New Features:**
  - Introduced the `.After()` clause for `EXPECT_CALL` to allow specifying call order dependencies on multiple mock expectations.
  - Support for initializing GoogleMock directly without command-line arguments, facilitating embedded platform usage.
- **Improvements:**
  - Optimized CMake integration scripts for better multi-config generator support.
  - Enhanced `MOCK_METHOD` handling for methods with complex qualifiers, such as `noexcept` and reference qualifiers.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Addressed build issues on Windows related to Visual Studio 2022 and updated compiler flags.
  - Fixed occasional mismatches in mock method argument printing in verbose logs.

### Version 1.12.1 (2023-07-20) - Patch Release
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Corrected broken installation paths in `pkg-config` files for Linux package managers.
  - Patched memory leak in `StrictMock` destructor reported in complex test suites.

### Version 1.12.0 (2023-06-05)
- **New Features:**
  - Added `NiceMock` wrapper to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, improving test log clarity.
  - Introduced detailed failure status codes to help diagnose flaky tests and mock invocation failures.
- **Improvements:**
  - Extended documentation with more practical examples for `EXPECT_CALL` modifiers such as `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.WillRepeatedly()`.
  - Enabled full support for GoogleMock flags via environment variables in addition to command line.
- **Breaking Changes:**
  - Deprecated older macros for setting mock expectations in favor of newer, more consistent `MOCK_METHOD` syntax.

### Version 1.11.0 (2022-11-28)
- **New Features:**
  - Support for partial mocks to allow chaining real method calls with mocks seamlessly.
  - Introduced `InSequence` and `Sequence` classes to express call ordering constraints more simply.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed edge case where default actions (`WillByDefault`) were ignored in certain chained expectations.

---

## Important Migration Notes

- When upgrading from versions prior to 1.12.0, it is crucial to update your mock method declarations to use the modern `MOCK_METHOD` macro format, as older macros have been deprecated and could lead to compilation warnings.
- The introduction of `.After()` clauses requires reviewing call order dependencies in your tests to ensure expectations are defined correctly.
- Changes to verbose logging flags and default behaviors may impact test output formatting; review your logging configurations accordingly.

---

## Additional Resources

- For a **comprehensive guide on mocking syntax and expectations**, see the [Mocking Reference](../api-reference/mocking-and-matchers/mock-methods.md).
- To understand **mock strictness modes** (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`), consult the [Mock Strictness Documentation](../api-reference/mocking-and-matchers/mock-strictness.md).
- For setup and configuration details, refer to the [Framework Configuration Guide](../api-reference/configuration-and-error-handling/framework-configuration.md).
- Review the [Breaking Changes & Deprecations](./breaking-changes.md) page for detailed upgrade instructions.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Pitfalls
- **Unrecognized Flags:** Ensure that GoogleMock flags like `--gmock_verbose` are correctly passed to your test executables. Misplacement or typos can cause flags to be ignored.
- **Unexpected Calls:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` with precise matchers. The `.With()` clause allows complex argument matching as a tuple for better filtering.
- **Leaked Mock Objects:** Enable `GMOCK_FLAG_SET(catch_leaked_mocks, true)` to detect leaks during test runs.

### Best Practices
- Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to enforce call order when the sequence of mock interactions is critical.
- Suppress noisy warnings on uninteresting calls in large test suites by wrapping mocks with `NiceMock`.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations that should not match calls beyond their upper bound cardinality.

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Reported Issues & Fixes">
<Accordion title="Memory Leak Warnings with `NaggyMock`">
Users observed intermittent leaks when using `NaggyMock` with complex mock lifecycles. These leaks have been addressed in version 1.14.0 by refining internal reference counting and destruction order.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Call Warnings Despite Proper Expectation Setup">
Verbose logging improvements help diagnose when GoogleMock flags are misconfigured or when multiple expectations overlap. Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace calls with detailed output.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Failures on Newer MSVC Versions">
Updates to compiler flags and CMake scripts in versions 1.13.0+ ensure compatibility with Visual Studio 2022 and later. Ensure your build system pulls the latest `CMakeLists.txt` and internal utilities.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Step title="Next Steps for Users Planning Upgrades">
1. Review your existing mock method declarations and update to `MOCK_METHOD` macro if still using legacy macros.
2. Check your test code for call order expectations and consider using `.After()` and `Sequence` constructs where needed.
3. Update your test runner command lines to ensure proper GoogleMock flag parsing.
4. Verify your build environment for C++17 compliance and supported compiler versions.
5. Run existing tests with verbose logging enabled to catch any latent mismatches or unexpected calls.
</Step>
