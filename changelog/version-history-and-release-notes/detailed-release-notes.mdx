## Best Practices When Reviewing Release Notes

- **Update Regularly**: Stay current with releases to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
- **Test in Isolation**: Before upgrading production tests, run your full test suite with the new version in a controlled environment.
- **Follow Migration Guides**: For major upgrades, consult the [Breaking Changes and Migration Guides](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/breaking_changes.md) for step-by-step assistance.
- **Backup Your Work**: Retain your existing tests and configurations to enable rollback if needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Release Upgrade Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Failures After Upgrade">
If your tests fail to compile after upgrading:
- Verify your compiler supports the minimum C++ standard required by the new release.
- Check for deprecated macros or APIs in your test code and update them according to migration notes.
- Review integration with build systems like CMake or Bazel to ensure proper flags are set.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unexpected Test Failures">
- Confirm that no changes in default mock strictness or assertion behaviors affect your existing tests.
- Inspect changes in matchers or actions that might have altered test expectations.
- Rerun tests with verbose output to identify failure causes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Degradation">
- Evaluate parallel test execution flags; some improvements may require configuration updates.
- Check if new features or default behaviors introduce overhead and adjust test suite accordingly.
</Accordion>
