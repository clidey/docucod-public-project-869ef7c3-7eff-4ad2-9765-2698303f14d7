## Latest Release

### Version 1.17.0 (Released: 2024-05-15)

#### New Features
- **Mandatory C++17 Standard Requirement:** The 1.17.x branch now requires at least C++17, enabling modern language features that improve stability and compatibility.
- **Enhanced Test Discovery and Parallelism:** Improvements in test sharding and filtering reduce test execution overhead and increase performance in large test suites.
- **Refined Mocking API Usability:** Added helper macros and improved error diagnostics to simplify mock object creation and usage.

#### Enhancements
- **Richer Assertion Messages:** Assertions now provide more detailed failure diagnostics, helping users pinpoint issues faster.
- **Improved Death Test Stability:** Adjusted internal handling for death tests, ensuring better thread-safety and cross-platform consistency.
- **Integration with Abseil (Experimental):** Preparations to optionally leverage Abseil libraries for logging and synchronization primitives have begun, promising future enhancements.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed multiple issues causing flaky test discovery on certain platforms.
- Resolved linking errors related to static and dynamic library inconsistencies in some build configurations.
- Corrected behavior of mock cardinalities when using chained expectations.

#### Deprecations
- Deprecated legacy macros superseded by modern, type-safe APIs. Users are encouraged to migrate using migration guides available in the documentation.
