## Best Practices for Upgrading

- Always review release notes for known issues and deprecations.
- Test your code extensively after upgrading, especially tests involving mocks and expectations.
- Leverage `ON_CALL` for default actions and `EXPECT_CALL` for stricter verification.
- Utilize `--gmock_verbose` flags to debug complex mock interactions.
