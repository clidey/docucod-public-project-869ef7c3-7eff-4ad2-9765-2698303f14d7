# Deprecations and Planned Removals

This page provides a continuously updated catalog of features, APIs, and platform components within GoogleTest that have been deprecated or are scheduled for removal. It enables users to stay informed about upcoming changes that may affect their test code or infrastructure, allowing proactive refactoring and adaptation to maintain compatibility and leverage new improvements.

---

## Purpose and User Benefits

Managing a test suite means adapting to evolving libraries and frameworks. Deprecations are signals that certain features or APIs are no longer supported and will be removed in the future releases. The **Deprecations and Planned Removals** page empowers you to anticipate such removals, avoid last-minute breakage, and design your migration with sufficient lead time.

By regularly reviewing this page, you will:

- Identify which features you currently depend on are obsolete.
- Understand the timeline and release versions in which removals are planned.
- Gain guidance on alternative approaches or migration strategies.
- Reduce surprise regressions by aligning your upgrade cycles.


## Content Overview

This page is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Deprecated Features and APIs

A comprehensive list of features, macros, methods, and configuration options marked deprecated. Each entry includes:

- **Name/Identifier**: The feature or API name.
- **Version Deprecated**: The release version when deprecation was introduced.
- **Description**: What the feature does, why it’s deprecated.
- **Reason for Deprecation**: For example, replaced by a more robust alternative, obsolete due to architecture changes, or security issues.
- **Suggested Alternatives**: How to achieve equivalent functionality with supported features.

### 2. Removed Features and APIs Timeline

Details on features that have been removed in recent releases, including:

- **Version Removed**: The release number where the feature was dropped.
- **Impact Statement**: What breaks due to removal.
- **Migration Path**: Steps to refactor code using removed features.

### 3. Platform Support Deprecations

Information about platforms or compiler versions no longer supported or planned for sunset, with justification and impacts.

- List of deprecated platform targets.
- Removal schedule and last supported versions.
- Guidance on supported and recommended platform targets.

### 4. Deprecation Timelines and Policies

Explains GoogleTest’s policy on deprecations, including:

- Typical duration between deprecation and removal.
- How deprecation announcements are communicated.
- Recommended user actions and their timing.

### 5. How to Handle Deprecations

Practical advice on how to track and respond to deprecations:

- Monitoring release notes and changelogs.
- Using compiler warnings and static analysis checks.
- Testing your codebase against upcoming versions.
- Submitting feedback or feature requests to the community.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Stay Current**: Regularly check this page before upgrading.
- **Automate Detection**: Treat compiler deprecation warnings as build failures.
- **Refactor Early**: Address deprecated APIs promptly to avoid technical debt.
- **Review Related Documentation**: Look at relevant upgrade guides and breaking changes listings.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

**Ignoring Deprecation Warnings** may result in unexpected failures in future versions.

**Assuming Deprecated Features Work Indefinitely** leads to fragile and outdated tests.

**Missing Alternative Recommendations** can prolong migration time. Always consult the suggested alternatives section.

**Compatibility Issues** might arise if mixed versions of dependencies are used; verify the compatibility matrix.

## Example Deprecations (Illustrative)

> ### Deprecated Macro `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST`
> Deprecated in v1.15.0.
> The macro `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST` for renaming test macros has been deprecated as it leads to confusing syntax and maintenance overhead.
> **Alternative:** Use the new macro `GTEST_TEST` prefix variants.

> ### Removed Support for C++14
> Removal effective since v1.17.0.
> GoogleTest now requires a minimum of C++17 standard for compilation.
> Update your build environment and configurations to use C++17 or newer.

> ### Deprecated Platform: Windows XP
> Deprecated as of v1.16.0. Support will be removed in the next major release.
> Modern Windows versions are required to receive security and performance improvements.

## Proactive User Workflow

1. Before upgrading GoogleTest, consult this **Deprecations and Planned Removals** page to identify any features you currently rely on that will be removed.
2. Refer to the migration instructions or suggested alternatives and adjust your test code accordingly.
3. Run your test suite with compiler warnings enabled to catch deprecated usage early.
4. Monitor subsequent releases for updated deprecations and removals.

<Tip>
Taking the time to adapt early reduces upgrade disruption and promotes cleaner, maintainable test code.
