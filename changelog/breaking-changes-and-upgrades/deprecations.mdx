# Deprecations

The **Deprecations** page provides a comprehensive list of all deprecated features, methods, and configuration options in GoogleMock, along with their timelines and recommended alternatives. This resource is designed specifically for engineers who want to future-proof their tests and avoid reliance on soon-to-be-removed APIs.

---

## Purpose and User Value

Deprecation is a critical lifecycle phase for software APIs, indicating that certain features will be removed in future releases. This page empowers users to proactively manage their codebase by:

- Identifying deprecated elements that may affect their tests.
- Planning migration timelines aligned with official deprecation schedules.
- Discovering recommended alternative APIs or patterns to replace deprecated ones.

By consulting this page, engineers ensure their tests remain compatible, maintainable, and resilient against future breaking changes.

## Structure of the Deprecation Listings

Each deprecated item documented here includes:

- **Feature or Method Name**: Clearly identifies the deprecated entity.
- **Deprecation Timeline**: Dates or version numbers specifying when the deprecation started and when removal is planned.
- **Reason for Deprecation**: Explanation of why the feature was deprecated â€” for example, replaced by a better API, obsolete usage, or architectural changes.
- **Recommended Alternatives**: Concrete guidance on how to update code to use supported features.

This structured approach allows users to quickly assess the impact and required actions.

## Example Scenario: Avoiding Deprecated MOCK_METHODn Macros

Earlier GoogleMock versions used a series of `MOCK_METHODn` macros for mocking methods. These macros have been deprecated in favor of the unified and more flexible `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

### Deprecation Details

- **Deprecated**: `MOCK_METHODn`, `MOCK_CONST_METHODn`, and their variants
- **Deprecation Start**: Version introduced the generic `MOCK_METHOD` (2018)
- **Planned Removal**: Future major version (to be announced)

### Alternative Recommendation

Update mock classes to use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro syntax:

```cpp
// Old deprecated style
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// New recommended style
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int));
```

Refer to the [Mock Class and Method Macros](../api-reference/mocking-matching-actions/mock-class-macros) page for detailed syntax and migration tips.

## How to Use This Page Effectively

1. **Regular Checks**: Incorporate this page into your regular upgrade and code review process to identify deprecated usage.
2. **Migration Planning**: Align your refactoring efforts with deprecation timelines to avoid last-minute breakages.
3. **Code Auditing**: Use this as a checklist when scanning your code for deprecated API use.
4. **Testing Compatibility**: Ensure that tests do not rely on deprecated features to maintain robustness.

<Tip>
Stay ahead of breaking changes by continuously monitoring deprecations documented here. The page complements the [Breaking Changes](../changelog/breaking-changes-and-upgrades/breaking-changes) and [Upgrade Guides](../changelog/breaking-changes-and-upgrades/upgrade-guides) pages.

## Troubleshooting Deprecated Usage

If you encounter test failures or warnings related to deprecated APIs:

- Verify you are using the latest recommended macros and patterns.
- Check deprecation timelines to understand urgency.
- Use verbosity flags such as `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed diagnostics.
- Review migration examples in the gMock Cookbook.

---

## Future-Proofing Best Practices

- Prefer the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro over legacy ones.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers wisely to minimize warnings for legacy calls.
- Avoid reliance on deprecated behaviors in new test code.
- Review official release notes linked in version histories.
