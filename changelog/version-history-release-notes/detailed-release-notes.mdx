## Understanding the Detailed Release Notes

This documentation provides an exhaustive and precise log of all changes made to GoogleTest and GoogleMock across versions. It focuses entirely on version-level updates, capturing the full breadth of API changes, feature improvements, bug fixes, behavior modifications, and deprecations.

The goal of this page is to empower users who need:

- To audit historical evolution of the codebase.
- To troubleshoot regressions by tracking fixes and changes.
- To understand the exact nature and impact of new features.
- To prepare for upgrades with detailed technical insight.

This is not a summary or highlights page; it is the authoritative source of all changes, intended for developers, maintainers, and highly technical users.
