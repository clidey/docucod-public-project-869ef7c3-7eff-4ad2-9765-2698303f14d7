# Release Highlights

GoogleTest's Release Highlights provide concise overviews of each major and minor version, focusing on the key features, critical improvements, and important changes that impact users directly. This page helps developers and teams quickly understand the evolution of the framework, spot valuable new capabilities, and prepare for upgrades.

---

## How to Use This Page

Each entry below presents a snapshot of a specific release, organized typically in reverse chronological order so you see the latest improvements first. For every version, you will find:

- A summary of **headline features** that add new testing capabilities or enhance usability.
- **Critical enhancements** that improve performance, compatibility, or security.
- Notes on **breaking changes** or behavioral differences that require attention.
- Context on **deprecations** or features slated for removal in future releases.

This targeted focus helps you quickly identify what matters most for maintaining or improving your test infrastructure.

## Important Notes on Breaking Changes and Migration

When upgrading to newer major releases, especially 1.17.x and beyond, be aware that GoogleTest now requires a C++17 compliant compiler and environment. Codebases built on older standards must be modernized to avoid build failures.

Check each releaseâ€™s detailed notes and migration guides for instructions on adapting your tests, mock declarations, or build configurations. Deprecated features are clearly marked with timelines to aid smooth transition.

---

## Practical Tips

- Before upgrading, verify your environment supports C++17 and meets updated platform requirements.
- Review breaking changes in detailed release notes to adjust test code or build setups accordingly.
- Take advantage of improved mocking and assertion capabilities to simplify and strengthen your tests.
- Leverage continuous integration enhancements by configuring XML reports and test filters based on new release capabilities.
