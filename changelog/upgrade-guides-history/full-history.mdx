# Full Change History

An exhaustive log of all documented changes, improvements, and corrections across every version of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This canonical record serves compliance, auditing, and deep-dive investigations into the evolution of the library, providing users with clear guidance on how the framework has evolved, any breaking changes encountered, and best practices for migration.

---

## 1. Overview of Change History

This document tracks all significant changes made throughout the GoogleTest and GoogleMock lifecycle, organized in reverse chronological order. Each entry is focused on the direct impact on users, detailing new features, bug fixes, deprecations, and important migration notes.

### Why Use This Change History?
- **Compliance & Auditing**: Maintain records of all modifications over time.
- **Upgrade Planning**: Identify breaking changes and migrations steps.
- **Troubleshooting**: Correlate fixes with issues faced in particular versions.

## 2. Version Release Structure

GoogleTest follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to clearly communicate the type of each release:

- **Major Releases (X.0.0)**: Introduce backward-incompatible changes and new capabilities requiring code adjustments.
- **Minor Releases (X.Y.0)**: Add features in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Patch Releases (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes and minor improvements with no API changes.

Each release includes:
- Summary of new features and their benefits.
- List of bug fixes and improvements.
- Any breaking changes with recommended migration steps.
- Security update details when applicable.

## 3. Notable Recent Releases

### Version 1.13.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Enhanced mocking syntax supporting overloaded and const methods cleaner.
- Introduced move-only type support in mocks to align with modern C++ usage.
- Improved default action specification making tests more predictable.
- Added advanced call sequencing control for better test interaction management.
- Fixed critical bugs related to thread safety during test execution.

### Version 1.12.1 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Fixed linking issues on Windows platforms, improving stability.
- Patched rare memory leak detected in mock object lifecycle.
- Resolved deadlock in concurrent test setups.

### Version 1.12.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Breaking change: Updated MOCK_METHOD macro syntax; migration guide provided.
- Added flag for strict mock behavior control.
- Deprecated legacy mock macros with clear removals timeline.
- Strengthened compatibility with latest C++ compiler standards.

## 4. Breaking Changes and Migration Details

Significant API shifts and boundary-breaking updates are communicated with explicit migration instructions:

- Transition from MOCK_METHODn macros to the unified MOCK_METHOD.
- New handling of uninteresting calls and mock strictness via NiceMock and StrictMock.
- Updated threading and compiler requirements to leverage modern standards.

For each breaking change:
- Detailed examples of before and after code adjustments.
- Instructions on flag usage to toggle legacy behaviors during migration.
- References to related guides and troubleshooting tips.

## 5. Deprecation Notices

Features phased out over multiple releases:
- Legacy mocking macros removed incrementally.
- Old mock strictness control macros deprecated in favor of robust wrappers.
- Notifications on deprecation timelines to prevent disruption.

Users are encouraged to proactively update tests using provided migration guides found in the [Upgrade Guides](../changelog/upgrade-guides-history/upgrade-guides.md).

## 6. Bug Fixes and Patch Summaries

All bug fixes are detailed with:
- The symptom or issue causing failure or unexpected behavior.
- The exact impact on test infrastructure or user tests.
- The fix applied and version introduced.

Highlights include:
- Stability fixes addressing intermittent hangs and crashes.
- Enhanced failure output diagnostics for better debugging.
- Patch sets improving compatibility across diverse platforms and build systems.

## 7. Security Updates

Any security-relevant fixes are documented separately, including:
- Vulnerabilities addressed.
- Impact assessments.
- Remediation steps users should follow.

As of the latest release, no critical security vulnerabilities affecting users have been reported.

## 8. Release History Index
