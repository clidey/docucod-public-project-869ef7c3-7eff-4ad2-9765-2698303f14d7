# Bug Fixes & Security Patches

This page documents the bug fixes and security patches applied in GoogleMock and related GoogleTest releases. Keeping your test framework up to date ensures you benefit from increased reliability, correctness, and protection against known issues.

---

## 1. Overview of Bug Fixes

Bug fixes address a wide array of correctness and stability problems discovered through users’ reports and internal testing. These sometimes relate to:

- Incorrect or unexpected mock behavior.
- Compiler warnings and errors caused by mocks or test macros.
- Memory and resource leaks observed during test execution.
- Interactions and ordering problems with mock expectations.
- Compatibility issues with specific compilers or platforms.

Applied fixes preserve the developer experience, avoid silent failures, and prevent false negatives or positives in testing outcomes.

---

## 2. Security Patches

Security patches primarily focus on preventing vulnerabilities within the test framework that could impact users’ test infrastructure, such as:

- Fixes to handling of potentially unsafe constructs in mock definitions.
- Corrections for improper cleanup or handling of test state that could be exploited.
- Improvements to thread safety and race condition handling.

As GoogleMock is generally used in test environments, these patches also reduce risks of unreliable testing artifacts or data corruption.

## 3. Notable Bug Fix Examples

### Virtual Method Mocking Fixes

Some bugs caused non-virtual methods to invoke the real implementation instead of mocked ones. This was resolved by clarifying that only virtual methods are mockable unless using specialized dependency injection as described in the gMock Cookbook.

### Variadic Function Mocking Clarifications

Due to inherent limits with ellipsis (`...`) parameters, recent fixes clarify that such functions cannot be mocked directly, emphasizing the user’s responsibility to define overloads.

### MSVC Warnings Mitigation

Adjustments prevent warning C4301 and C4373 triggered by const-qualified parameters in mock method declarations on MSVC compilers by recommending removal of the meaningless top-level const qualifier on parameters.

### Heapcheck Failures from Missing Virtual Destructors

Fixes include advice about ensuring base classes have virtual destructors when mocking, preventing memory leaks and undefined behaviors during object destruction.

### Duplicate Expectation Failure Messages

Clarified that seeing repeated failure messages during testing is expected behavior reflecting different failure moments rather than redundant logs.

### Handling Unexpected Calls and Warnings

Enhancements to verbose logging and guidance on controlling warnings about uninteresting mock calls improve debugging and reduce noise without hiding potential problems.

## 4. How to Stay Protected

- Regularly update to the latest stable release to incorporate all critical bug and security patches.
- When encountering unexpected test behaviors or warnings, consult the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html) and [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues).
- Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag as recommended to get detailed traces on mock function calls when diagnosing failures.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Bug Symptoms

<Tip>
Common symptoms indicating bugs include unexpected mock method calls triggering real implementations, confusing error messages repeating the same expectation failures, and heapcheck errors related to mock object lifecycle mishandling.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Enable verbose logging with `--gmock_verbose=info` to inspect the exact flow of mock calls, helping to pinpoint if expectations are mismatched or if there are shadowing problems.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Review warnings from MSVC compilers related to const parameters in mock methods and apply recommended fixes by removing top-level const where applicable.
</Tip>

## 6. Applying Updates

Follow your project’s standard process to incorporate GoogleMock updates:

1. Review the release notes for affected bug fixes or security patches targeting your test scenarios.
2. Update your build dependency to the latest release tag or commit.
3. Rebuild your tests and rerun them to ensure stability.
4. Monitor for any new warnings or test failures which may indicate required migration steps.

Regular patching is key to reliable and secure C++ testing.
