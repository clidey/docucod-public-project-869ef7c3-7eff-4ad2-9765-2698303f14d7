# Deprecations & Removal Notices

This page serves as your definitive source for staying informed about features, APIs, and platforms within GoogleTest and GoogleMock that have been deprecated, are scheduled for removal, or are no longer supported. Understanding these notices ensures you can adapt your testing environment proactively, avoid disruptions, and leverage recommended alternatives to maintain robust and future-proof test suites.

---

## Overview of Deprecations and Removals

GoogleTest and GoogleMock evolve continuously to embrace new C++ standards, improve usability, and optimize performance. As part of this evolution, some legacy features, unstable APIs, or platform-specific support may be deprecated or removed. These changes help maintain the framework's clarity, prevent maintenance overhead, and encourage best practices.

This page details such changes—organized with clear timelines, user impact, and migration strategies—to help you confidently keep your test infrastructure aligned with evolving GoogleTest releases.

## Understanding Deprecation Notices

### What It Means for You

A deprecated feature is still available but is considered obsolete and may be removed in future releases. Continued use is discouraged because:

- It may no longer receive bug fixes or security patches.
- It may be incompatible with newer compiler or platform versions.
- There often exist better, more efficient, or safer alternatives.

### Recommended Practices

- **Identify Usage:** Search your codebase and test environments for deprecated features.
- **Plan Migration:** Evaluate alternatives provided by GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Transition your tests stepwise, validating after each change.
- **Monitor Release Notes:** Stay informed of removal deadlines and updated guidance.

<Tip>
Early migration reduces disruption and allows you to benefit from performance improvements and new capabilities of supported features.
</Tip>

## Removal Notices

When a feature is removed from GoogleTest, it ceases to exist in the codebase and will cause compilation or linking errors if still referenced.

To avoid unexpected failures:

- Consult this page regularly to catch upcoming removals.
- Follow migration guides and deprecation schedules diligently.
- Update your tests and build environment accordingly.

<Warning>
Ignoring removal notices will cause build breakage and potentially impact continuous integration workflows.
</Warning>

## Current Deprecations and Scheduled Removals

### Deprecated Compiler and Platform Flags

- GoogleTest now requires a C++17-compatible environment; versions earlier than C++17 are deprecated and unsupported.
- Macros and flags indicating threading or exception support (e.g., `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) may be phased out as detection and configuration improve automatically.

### API Deprecations

- Internal macros and symbols ending with underscores (e.g., those in `gtest-port.h`) are not part of the public API and are subject to change without notice; usage outside of GoogleTest is discouraged.
- Legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros in GoogleMock are deprecated in favor of the more versatile `MOCK_METHOD` macro; migration is recommended for improved compatibility and maintenance.

### Platform Support Changes

- Minimal or embedded platforms without file system or threading support see reduced or discontinued GoogleTest support, consistent with practical limitations.


---

## Migration and Alternatives

### Migrating from Deprecated Macros or APIs

- Replace all `MOCK_METHODn` macros with `MOCK_METHOD` following the signature

  ```cpp
  MOCK_METHOD(ReturnType, MethodName, (Args...), (Qualifiers));
  ```

- Avoid direct use of internal or legacy macros; prefer public APIs documented in official references.

### Handling Platform Changes

- Confirm your platform supports required features, such as POSIX threads and file system APIs.
- Use conditional compilation or refactor tests to adapt where platform support has changed.

### Build and Compiler Compliance

- Ensure your build system enforces C++17 or later standards.
- Review and adapt `CMakeLists.txt` or other build scripts to align with recommended compiler flags and remove deprecated macros.

---

## Practical Tips for Staying Ahead

- Subscribe to release announcements and monitor the Changelog.
- Integrate static analysis tools to detect deprecated API usage.
- Employ CI jobs that validate against latest GoogleTest versions to detect breakage early.

## Troubleshooting Deprecated Features

### Common Symptoms

- Compilation or linking failures referencing removed or deprecated symbols.
- Warnings about deprecated macros or APIs during build.
- Test failures related to behavior changes after upgrade.

### Steps to Resolve

1. Confirm which version of GoogleTest your project uses.
2. Review this Deprecation & Removal Notices page and the detailed Migration Guides.
3. Update test and build files to avoid deprecated constructs.
4. Rebuild and run tests fully to validate.
