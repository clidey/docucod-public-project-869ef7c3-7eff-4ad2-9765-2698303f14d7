# Improvements and Enhancements

This document outlines smaller but valuable improvements within GoogleMock that enhance performance, expand platform compatibility, improve documentation clarity, and strengthen API robustness. These improvements collectively refine the developer experience when creating and managing mock objects, leading to more efficient and reliable test code.

---

## 1. Enhanced Mock Method Definitions

GoogleMock continues to improve the `MOCK_METHOD` macro, which defines mock methods within mock classes. Key improvements include:

- **Expanded Qualifier Support:** Support for C++ method qualifiers such as `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, calling convention specifiers (`Calltype(...)`), and reference qualifiers (`ref(&)`, `ref(&&)`) are fully supported. This ensures mocks match their interfaces exactly, eliminating subtle bugs.

- **Robust Parsing of Complex Signatures:** Addressing issues caused by commas in complex argument types (e.g., `std::pair<bool, int>` or `std::map<int, double>`), users can now wrap such types in parentheses or define type aliases, enabling trouble-free mock method declarations even with intricate types.

- **Required Public Placement:** Mock methods must reside in the `public:` section of the mock class regardless of the original methodâ€™s access level (public, protected, or private). This uniform policy supports consistent use through `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` macros.

```cpp
class MyMock {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool));
};
```

## 2. Flexible Expectation Setting with `EXPECT_CALL`

The macro `EXPECT_CALL` lets users set detailed expectations on mock methods with a clear, declarative syntax:

- **Comprehensive Modifier Clauses:** 
  - `.With()` to constrain argument tuples with complex matchers.
  - `.Times()` allowing exact or fuzzy call count specification (e.g., `AnyNumber()`, `AtLeast(n)`, `Exactly(n)`).
  - `.InSequence()` and `.After()` support strict or partial ordering of expected calls.
  - `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` to define custom behaviors or return values.
  - `.RetiresOnSaturation()` facilitates retiring expectations after usage.

- **Natural Ordering and Overriding:** Newer expectations override older ones, enabling progressive refinement of behavior.

- **Default Cardinality Inference:** When omitted, `EXPECT_CALL` intelligently infers how many times calls are expected based on the presence of action clauses.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, GetNumber())
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(3));
```

## 3. Default Behavior with `ON_CALL`

`ON_CALL` defines default behaviors for mock methods without imposing call count expectations:

- Supports `.With()` clause like `EXPECT_CALL` for complex tuple matching.
- Requires a single `.WillByDefault()` clause specifying the action.
- Serves as a fallback when no matching `EXPECT_CALL` is found, keeping tests more flexible and less brittle.

```cpp
ON_CALL(my_mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt())
    .WillByDefault(Return(true));
```

## 4. Strictness Modes via Wrappers

GoogleMock provides convenient wrappers that alter behavior toward uninteresting mock calls:

- **`NiceMock<T>`:** Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls to mock methods. Recommended to reduce noise in tests where calls are allowed but not significant.

- **`NaggyMock<T>`:** Prints warnings on uninteresting calls; the default behavior.

- **`StrictMock<T>`:** Treats all uninteresting calls as test failures, useful when strict behavior verification is desired.

Each of these is a subclass of the original mock class `T` and inherits its constructors for seamless substitution.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(nice_foo, DoSomething());
```

**Note:** These wrappers only affect mock methods declared directly with `MOCK_METHOD` in the mock class, and may not work reliably for methods inherited from base classes.

## 5. Improved Mock Object Lifecycle Management

- **Automatic Verification:** Expectations on mock objects are automatically verified upon destruction, reducing boilerplate in tests.

- **Manual Control:** Users can explicitly verify and clear expectations anytime via `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` or `Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock_obj)`.

- **Leak Detection:** The framework detects leaked mock objects at program exit and reports errors, helping catch test mismanagement. Users can suppress leak warnings with `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj)` when intentional.

## 6. Enhanced Diagnostic and Logging

- **Verbosity Levels:** Controlled by the `--gmock_verbose` flag, levels include `info`, `warning` (default), and `error` to adjust how much mock call detail, warnings, and stack traces are printed.

- **Detailed Failure Messages:** When expectations are violated, gMock produces comprehensive messages describing expected vs. actual call counts, argument mismatches, and call ordering violations.

- **Stack Traces:** At `info` verbosity, stack traces are printed with expectation invocations and mock method calls, greatly easing debugging.

## 7. Performance and Compilation Optimizations

In complex projects, compiling mocks can become a bottleneck. To mitigate this:

- Users can move mock class constructors and destructors to separate `.cc` files to reduce template instantiations across multiple files.

- The internal implementation minimizes unnecessary template bloat and runtime overhead.

## 8. Extended Platform and Compiler Compatibility

Internal adjustments have broadened support for:

- Various desktop and embedded platforms.
- Multiple versions of MSVC, Clang, GCC, and other compilers.
- Specific adaptations to maintain correct behavior on Windows, Linux, macOS, and specialized embedded targets.

## 9. Documentation and UX Enhancements

- The mock API documentation has been expanded with practical examples, clarifications on matching, expectations, and common pitfalls.

- Guidance on how to write mocks for complex interfaces, including overloaded, templated, and move-only type methods, is now more comprehensive.

- Clear examples and tips promote best practices, such as proper expectation ordering, retirement, and when to use `ON_CALL` vs. `EXPECT_CALL`.

## 10. Robustness and Safety Improvements

- Thread safety is maintained for concurrent mock method calls.

- To avoid deadlocks, actions invoked by mocks are careful not to hold internal locks while calling user code.

- The framework prevents undefined behavior such as setting expectations after the mock has started being used.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` Judiciously:** Only enforce call expectations that are part of the contract under test; favor `ON_CALL` for default behaviors to avoid brittle tests.

- **Prefer `NiceMock` for Less Noise:** Use `NiceMock` in tests where uninteresting calls should be silently ignored.

- **Utilize `.RetiresOnSaturation()` and `.InSequence()`:** These clauses help control call ordering and avoid unexpected failures due to sticky expectations.

- **Do Not Mock Non-Virtual Methods Blindly:** Instead, consider refactoring with interfaces or the high-performance injection pattern as documented.

- **Verify Mock Lifecycles:** Make sure mock objects are destructed or verified explicitly to catch unmet expectations.

- **Write Mock Classes in Shared Testing Packages:** For interfaces owned by other teams, define and maintain mocks in a centralized test-only location for sustainability.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:** Usually indicate missing `EXPECT_CALL` or the need for `NiceMock`.

- **Unexpected Call Failures:** Check that call arguments match expectations exactly; use verbose logging to trace the matching process.

- **Overloaded Methods Ambiguity:** Disambiguate overloads using explicit argument lists or type-safe matcher casts.

- **Move-Only Types in Mocks:** Use lambdas or functors as actions and avoid returning move-only types with `Return()` unless wrapped properly.

- **Mock Object Leaks:** Explicitly delete mocks or mark them as leaky; otherwise, gMock reports errors at program exit.
