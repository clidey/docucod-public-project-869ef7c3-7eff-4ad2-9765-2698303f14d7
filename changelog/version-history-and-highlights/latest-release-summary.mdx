## What’s New in Release 1.17.x

GoogleTest 1.17.0 introduces several key updates aimed at improving usability, modernizing codebase requirements, and preparing for upcoming dependencies:

- **C++17 as Minimum Standard**: The entire 1.17.x branch now requires a compiler and build environment that supports at least C++17. This upgrade modernizes the codebase, improving maintainability and leveraging new language features.

- **Unified GoogleTest and GoogleMock**: The merged repository continues delivering both frameworks together, streamlining dependency management and ensuring compatibility.

- **Plans for Abseil Dependency**: The team has announced an upcoming dependency on Abseil, which will provide enhanced utility libraries and consistency.

- **Continuous Integration Enhancements**: Google’s internal CI systems are actively used to maintain quality and prompt detection of regressions.

- **Updated Documentation**: Official user documentation is now published on GitHub Pages, providing easier browsing and searchability.

These upgrades reflect GoogleTest’s commitment to keeping pace with modern C++ standards and developer workflows.

## Impact on Your Workflow

### Compiler and Toolchain Requirements

Since C++17 is now mandatory, ensure your compiler and toolchain support this standard or later before upgrading to version 1.17.x. This aligns with the [Google foundational C++ support policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard).

### Merging GoogleTest and GoogleMock

GoogleTest and GoogleMock continue to be maintained as a combined project. This reduces integration friction and guarantees seamless compatibility between testing and mocking components.

### Build and Installation

1. Clone the v1.17.0 branch:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
   ```
2. Follow the updated build instructions using CMake or your preferred build tool.
3. Set the C++ standard to 17 or higher explicitly in your build configuration:
   ```cmake
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
   ```

### Usage and Migration Tips

- Review your current test projects for compliance with C++17 features and compiler flags.
- Take advantage of improved language features for writing clearer and safer tests.
- Plan to incorporate the upcoming Abseil dependency when it becomes available, which will further enhance usability.

## Compatibility Notes

- Platforms and compiler toolchains listed in the [foundational support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) remain supported.
- If you maintain legacy environments that do not support C++17, you must stick with earlier GoogleTest versions.
- For continuous integration builds, verify that all build agents and containers comply with the new minimum C++ standard.

## Additional Resources and Support

- **Release Announcement:** You can review the full release details on the [GitHub release page for v1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0).
- **User Guide:** Detailed usage instructions and primer available at the [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/).
- **Build Instructions:** Comprehensive build and installation steps in the [googletest/README.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md).
- **Compatibility and Requirements:** See the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../../getting-started/setup-basics/prerequisites-requirements) documentation.

## Summary

The 1.17.x release marks a critical modernization milestone for GoogleTest, introducing C++17 as the baseline and unifying GoogleTest and GoogleMock in one release cadence. Updating ensures you benefit from streamlined workflows, cleaner codebase adherence, and future-proofing ahead of new dependencies like Abseil.

### Troubleshooting & Common Concerns

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips for Upgrading to 1.17.x">
<Accordion title="Build Failures or Compiler Errors">
If you encounter build errors related to language features or incompatibilities, verify your compiler supports C++17 fully. On CMake, double-check `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` settings, and ensure your build environment is up to date.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linking Issues Between GoogleTest and GoogleMock">
Ensure you link both libraries appropriately. With the merged repository, it is recommended to use the combined build targets (`gmock_main`) which contain both components.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Test Failures After Upgrade">
Review changes to assertions or test registrations. Although rare, some behavior improvements might affect test expectations. Consult updated documentation and the GoogleTest user guide for any adjusted usage patterns.

### Example: Building GoogleTest 1.17.0 with CMake

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17
make
sudo make install
```

This ensures your project uses C++17 and builds the latest GoogleTest and GoogleMock binaries.
