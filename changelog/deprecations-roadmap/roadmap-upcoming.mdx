# Project Roadmap & Upcoming Changes

This document outlines the future direction of the GoogleTest project, focusing specifically on planned architectural changes, new dependencies, and evolving project standards. It serves as a guide to help you align your upgrade plans and maintenance schedules with upcoming shifts in GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Introduction

GoogleTest continues to evolve to meet modern C++ development standards and user needs. This page gives an advance look at significant upcoming changes, upcoming dependencies, and how these changes will affect your integration and usage.

By understanding these planned changes early, you can better prepare your codebase and testing workflows to adapt smoothly.


## 2. Planned New Dependencies

### Abseil Adoption

- **What:** GoogleTest is planning to take a dependency on [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp), Google's open-source collection of C++ libraries.

- **Why:** Abseil offers modern utility libraries, improved portability abstractions, and richer functionality that simplifies GoogleTest internals and enhances the user experience.

- **User Impact:**
  - Upgrade timelines may shift to ensure compatibility with Abseil versions.
  - Some internal components of GoogleTest will leverage Abseil utilities, but this will be largely transparent to you.
  - If your environment uses an older or incompatible Abseil version, plan for an update to reduce conflicts.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Begin exploring Abseil in your projects where applicable to reduce transition friction.
  - Monitor your build environment for Abseil compatibility.

<Tip>
Adopting Abseil provides ongoing benefits including modern thread support, string utilities, and flag parsing that align with GoogleTest's future capabilities.

## 3. Architectural Changes

### Modularization and Refactoring

- **Goal:** Refactor GoogleTest internals for a cleaner separation of concerns and improved maintainability.

- **Scope:** Enhanced portability layers, updated synchronization primitives, and a more modular core.

- **What to Expect:**
  - Improved thread safety guarantees and synchronization mechanisms.
  - Updates in internal flag management and configuration APIs.

- **User Impact:** These changes are mostly internal but may require attention in custom extensions or advanced uses where GoogleTest internal headers or macros (e.g., `gtest-port.h`) are involved.

- **Best Practices:** Avoid direct dependencies on internal headers or macros where possible, preferring the public API. This will help ensure your tests continue to build without modifications post updates.


## 4. Evolving Project Standards

### C++ Version Requirements

- GoogleTest now requires **at least C++17** for all new releases in the 1.17.x branch and beyond.

- **Why:** This ensures usage of modern language features for better performance, clearer code, and consistent behavior across compilers.

- **User Impact:**
  - Ensure your build environment supports C++17 or higher.
  - Align your project’s compiler settings accordingly.


### Testing and Platform Support

- Continued adherence to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard) guides platform and compiler support decisions.

- Users should keep an eye on the [Supported Platforms](https://google.github.io/googletest/overview/features-integration/supported-platforms) documentation for updates.


## 5. Upgrade Planning and Coordination

To ensure that your usage of GoogleTest stays robust and compatible through these changes:

- Frequently check this roadmap page for updates on the schedule and scope.

- Follow the official release notes and migration guides for each major/minor release:
  - [Migration Guides](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/migrations-breaking-changes/migration-guides)
  - [Breaking Changes Overview](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/migrations-breaking-changes/breaking-changes)

- Test your integration with beta versions that include planned changes.

- Engage with the community or issue tracker if you encounter compatibility challenges.


## 6. Summary of Upcoming Changes

| Area                      | Summary                                              | User Impact                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Abseil Dependency         | Planned adoption of Abseil as a core dependency       | Upgrade path required         |
| Architecture Refactor     | Modularization, better thread support, config updates| Minimal internal impact; avoid internal APIs|
| C++ Version Enforcement   | C++17 minimum requirement                             | Update compiler/flags         |
| Platform & Compiler Support| Aligned with Google foundational policy             | Track supported platform list |


## 7. Tips for Smooth Transition

- Prioritize maintaining your tests on a C++17-capable toolchain.
- Monitor dependencies related to Abseil, especially if you use it outside GoogleTest.
- Avoid reliance on undocumented internals; prefer official, public API functions.
- Keep test runners and CI agents updated to support the evolving GoogleTest.
