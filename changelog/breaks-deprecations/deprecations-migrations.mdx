# Deprecations & Migration Guides

GoogleTest evolves continuously to improve your testing experience, but this progress sometimes requires revisiting existing test code and adapting to deprecated APIs or features. This page helps you navigate deprecated components across recent releases, providing clear, step-by-step migration guides that minimize upgrade friction. By following the guidance here, you can smoothly transition your tests to use recommended replacement APIs and best practices, avoiding pitfalls and maintaining robust test suites.

## Understanding Deprecations

Deprecation means a feature or API is discouraged from use and is planned for removal in future versions. While deprecated features currently remain functional, reliance on them may cause maintenance challenges or incompatibilities down the road.

In GoogleTest, deprecations are announced well ahead of removals, paired with migration advice. This gives you ample time to update your code.

Key reasons for deprecations include:

- **Modernizing APIs**: Leveraging newer C++ standards and idioms for safer, clearer code.
- **Removing Legacy Confusion**: Phasing out older naming conventions or conflicting APIs.
- **Fixing Design Inconsistencies**: Simplifying framework usage and reducing ambiguity.

## Common Deprecated APIs and Their Replacements

### 1. `TestCase` â†’ `TestSuite`

Historically, GoogleTest used the term *TestCase* to group tests. This term has been deprecated for the clearer and more accurate *TestSuite*.

**Migration Guidance:**

- Replace all occurrences of `TestCase` with `TestSuite`.
- Replace `SetUpTestCase()` and `TearDownTestCase()` with `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`, respectively.

```cpp
// Deprecated
static void SetUpTestCase() {}
static void TearDownTestCase() {}

// Recommended
static void SetUpTestSuite() {}
static void TearDownTestSuite() {}
```

> Note: GoogleTest continues to support the old API for backward compatibility, but migrating ensures alignment with the current terminology and API expectations.

### 2. Typed Test Suite Naming Macros

Several macros related to typed and type-parameterized tests have been renamed to use the "Suite" suffix instead of "Case":

| Deprecated Macro                          | Replacement Macro                      |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P`                | `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`            |
| `TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`                      | `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`                  |
| `TYPED_TEST_CASE`                        | `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`                    |
| `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`             | `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`         |
| `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P`          | `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`      |

**Migration Steps:**

- Update your test macro names according to the table above.
- Review your build to ensure no references to the deprecated macros remain.

> These changes align naming conventions with the more intuitive "Suite" terminology and avoid confusion.

## Step-By-Step Migration Example

Suppose your code uses deprecated `TestCase` APIs and macros like this:

```cpp
class MyTestCase : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestCase() { /* legacy setup */ }
  static void TearDownTestCase() { /* legacy teardown */ }
};

TEST_F(MyTestCase, ExampleTest) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(SomeCondition());
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P(MyInst, MyTypedTest, testing::Types<int, double>);
```

### To migrate:

1. Rename the class and methods to use `TestSuite` variations:

```cpp
class MyTestSuite : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() { /* updated setup */ }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() { /* updated teardown */ }
};
```

2. Replace macro usages:

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyInst, MyTypedTest, testing::Types<int, double>);
```

3. Recompile and run tests for verification.

## Best Practices for Handling Deprecations

- **Start Early**: Begin migrations as soon as a deprecation is announced.
- **Automate Checks**: Use compiler warnings and static analysis tools to detect deprecated usage.
- **Consult Documentation**: Frequently check release notes and migration guides.
- **Refactor Tests**: Where possible, write new tests using current APIs and update or archive legacy ones accordingly.
- **Leverage Community**: Review samples and community discussions for proven migration patterns.

## Troubleshooting Common Migration Issues

| Issue                                   | Tips to Resolve                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compilation errors due to renamed APIs  | Verify all deprecated macros and methods are updated correctly. |
| Warnings about deprecated features      | Enable compiler warnings and fix instances incrementally.       |
| Unexpected test failures after migration| Confirm test dependencies and check lifecycle hooks are intact. |
| Confusion between `TestCase` and `TestSuite` usage | Review official naming guidelines; `TestSuite` is the current preferred term. |

## Staying Informed on Deprecations

- Monitor official [GoogleTest GitHub releases](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) for deprecation announcements.
- Subscribe to GoogleTest mailing lists or forums.
- Regularly consult the [Version History & Roadmap](../release-highlights/version-history) page.
