# Bug Fixes & Patches

An itemized log of resolved issues and stability improvements across recent GoogleTest releases. Leverage this knowledge to address known defects, increase test reliability, and minimize upgrade surprises.

---

## Overview

This page details fixes and patches applied to GoogleTest and GoogleMock, focusing specifically on addressing bugs and enhancing framework stability. It is designed to help users identify defect resolutions relevant to their use cases and to understand improvements that might affect their testing workflows.

The fixes include corrections to mocking behavior, expectation handling, verbose output controls, and leak detection, among others.

## Key Bug Fixes and Patches

### Improved Mock Output and Verbosity Handling
- Introduced better control over gMock verbosity levels through `--gmock_verbose` flag, allowing users to toggle the amount of diagnostic information printed during test runs. Verbosity levels include `info` (most detailed), `warning` (default), and `error` (least verbose).
- Enhanced diagnostic messages for expectation mismatches, uninteresting calls, and unexpected method invocations to include clearer stack traces and matched expectations for easier debugging.

### Correct Handling of Mock Expectations
- Fixed cases where explicit expected call actions (`WillOnce`) run out, ensuring that mock methods fall back on default actions set by `ON_CALL` rather than causing silent failures.
- Addressed issues with excessive calls beyond those specified in `EXPECT_CALL`, providing clear error reporting and fallback to default actions as specified by `ON_CALL`.
- Improved the matching algorithm for expectations, properly handling argument mismatches and the use of `.With()` clauses for multi-argument matchers to accurately identify unsatisfied prerequisites and expectation violations.

### Leak Detection and Mock Cleanup
- Enhanced infrastructure to catch leaked mocks that were allocated on the heap but never destroyed, triggering warnings or failures as configured by the `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks` flag.
- Added specific tests to validate that leaked mocks with active expectations or default actions are detected reliably.

### Support for Complex Argument Matching
- Fixed matcher printing and comparison logic to correctly handle complex matchers such as `Ge()`, `Ref()`, and combined conditions in `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Ensured that matchers using references or composed with `With()` are accurately represented in failure messages to help users identify argument mismatches.

### Expectation Order and Sequence Enforcement
- Corrected handling of partial and full order constraints for expectations, including improvements to `InSequence` and `After` clauses.
- Fixed edge cases where expectations with multiple `Sequence` memberships correctly enforce call ordering across sequences.

### Special Case Fixes
- Corrected mock method behavior for void return types, ensuring `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` produce coherent diagnostic output and properly handle uninteresting and excessive invocations.
- Addressed naming collisions and correct usage for mock destructors by recommending patterns such as adding a `Die()` method to track destruction events.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to set explicit verification of method calls, and rely on `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior.
- When verbose output is necessary to diagnose test failures, run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info`; revert to `warning` or `error` levels for routine runs.
- Take advantage of `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations to prevent upper bound call failures when methods may be called more than expected.
- To suppress warnings for uninteresting calls globally, prefer `NiceMock` over using many `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` statements.
- Always ensure mock classes inherit virtual destructors to avoid leaks and undefined behavior.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls
Understanding the difference is key:
- **Uninteresting calls**: No expectation exists; by default they generate warnings.
- **Unexpected calls**: Calls with expectations set, but no matching expectation for given arguments; these cause errors.

### Verbosity Setting
Adjust the verbosity level if output is overwhelms or lacks needed detail:
```shell
--gmock_verbose=info    # Shows detailed call match tracing and stacks
--gmock_verbose=warning # Default, shows warnings and errors
--gmock_verbose=error   # Shows only errors
```

### Leaked Mocks
Enable leak detection via:
```shell
--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks=true
```
If leaks occur, verify test teardown and object ownership, or mark mocks with `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional.
