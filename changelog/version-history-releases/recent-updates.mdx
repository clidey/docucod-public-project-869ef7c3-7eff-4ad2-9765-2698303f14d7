# Recent Updates (Latest Major Versions)

This page provides you with detailed, actionable notes on the latest major releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It is designed to help you quickly understand impactful changes, improvements, and migration guidance that affect your ongoing development and testing efforts.

## 1. Latest Major Releases Overview

Stay current with the most relevant releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, emphasizing improvements in stability, compatibility, and developer experience. Each release contains direct links to official release assets and detailed migration instructions when applicable.

### 1.1 Version 1.17.0 (Released Date: [Refer to official release notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0))

- **Minimum C++ Standard Requirement:** Now requires at least C++17. Ensure your projects are configured to target C++17 or higher to maintain compatibility.

- **Dependency Updates:** Plans to introduce a dependency on the Abseil C++ library ([Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp)) are forthcoming, which will improve internal utilities and compatibility with Google's infrastructure.

- **Build System Questions:** The `CMakeLists.txt` for GoogleMock now gracefully integrates GoogleTest as a subproject with clear options to build tests, control shared/static libraries, and configure compiler flags. This helps streamline build integration across platforms.

- **Known Improvements:**
  - Enhanced platform support adhering strictly to Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy.
  - Optimizations in synchronization primitives and internal utilities for improved thread safety.
  - Improved and consistent handling of environment and platform macros, especially in `gtest-port.h`.

### 1.2 Key Documentation Updates

- Documentation is now hosted and recommended primarily on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for improved accessibility and version control.

- Updated guides, including enhanced mock usage tutorials and assertion best practices, are continuously integrated to serve user intent clearly.

### 1.3 Migration & Compatibility Notes

- **Upgrading from Earlier Versions:**
  - Verify that your build environment supports C++17 or later.
  - Adjust your CMake configurations as the GoogleMock CMake setup changed to better isolate GoogleTest binary directories.
  - Review your usage of deprecated macros and platform checks; these have been consolidated or removed where possible.

- **Threading and Exception Guarantees:**
  - The new internal threading models and feature macros (e.g., `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) now reflect accurate platform capabilities.
  - Expect improved and consistent death test support, mirroring the latest strategies documented in [Death Tests Guide](../guides/mocking-and-advanced-usage/using-death-tests.md).

<Tip>
Ensure the build infrastructure and CI configuration are updated to use C++17 and link against required libraries like pthreads where applicable to avoid runtime issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Release Highlights and User Impact

### 2.1 Build and Integration Enhancements

- GoogleMock's build system now places GoogleTest binaries in a dedicated subdirectory, preventing conflicts especially on Visual C++ compilers.

- Comprehensive options added to control building GoogleMockâ€™s own tests, assisting users in faster iteration without unnecessary compilation.

- Improved packaging support with consistent `.pc.in` files for both GoogleTest and GoogleMock to facilitate pkg-config integration.

### 2.2 Platform Portability

- Updated `gtest-port.h` enforces a minimum C++17 requirement and provides explicit macros for feature detection, allowing users to adapt code for platform-specific behaviors with clarity.

- Greater coverage of supported platforms and more precise environment macros enhance cross-platform test reliability.

### 2.3 Testing Framework Improvements

- Mocking behavior enhancements include stricter checking, better warnings, and options for controlling warnings on uninteresting calls via strictness modes.

- Refined synchronization primitives and thread local storage mechanisms improve thread safety and reduce risk of deadlocks or data races in multi-threaded tests.

- Support for exception detection and handling is improved through macros that detect compile-time exception availability.

### 2.4 User-Facing Benefits

- Simplified upgrade path with clearer migration instructions and deprecation warnings minimizes potential disruptions.

- Documentation hosts and formats optimized for user accessibility ease the learning curve for new and advanced users alike.

- Enhanced test reliability and coverage from platform-specific fixes and threading improvements build confidence in tests run across diverse environments.

## 3. How to Take Advantage of the Latest Releases

### 3.1 Update Your Build Environment

- Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or later.

- Adjust your CMake build scripts to use the updated GoogleMock subdirectory structure and options like `gmock_build_tests`.

- Review threading macros and feature-defining flags (e.g., `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) in your build configuration.

### 3.2 Leverage Improved Documentation

- Access the latest user guides and API references hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://google.github.io/googletest/).

- Follow migration guides to adapt tests for new macro names and supported features.

### 3.3 Explore New and Updated Features

- Review and experiment with stricter mock strictness modes to control test behaviors more precisely.

- Use enhanced logging and assertion utilities for clearer test diagnostics.

- Incorporate the new build options to optimize test compile and run times as your project scales.

<Tip>
Regularly synchronize with the official releases and changelogs to catch important updates and leverage new capabilities as early as possible.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Upgrade Issues

### 4.1 Build Failures Related to C++ Version

- If you encounter errors referencing features or headers not found in earlier C++ versions, verify your project is compiling with at least C++17.

- Update your CI and local build toolchain if necessary.

### 4.2 GoogleMock and GoogleTest Integration Problems

- Ensure you follow the updated CMake conventions, especially surrounding subdirectory placement.

- Use the new options like `gmock_build_tests` to control test compilation explicitly.

### 4.3 Threading and Exception Detection Variations

- Refer to the platform-specific feature macros in `gtest-port.h` to diagnose missing features or capabilities.

- Adjust your build flags to match detected environment features.

<Tip>
Consult the [Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls](../../getting-started/first-test-usage/troubleshooting-setup.md) guide for detailed resolutions to common issues.
