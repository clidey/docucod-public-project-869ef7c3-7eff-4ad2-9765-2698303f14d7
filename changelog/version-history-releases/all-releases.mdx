## Recent Notable Release: 1.17.0

- **Released:** (See [Release 1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0) for exact date and notes.)
- **Feature:** This release requires projects to use at least C++17, aligning GoogleTest with modern C++ standards for improved language features and performance.

### Why This Matters

Upgrading to version 1.17.0 ensures your tests and build environment benefit from cleaner language support, safer code, and better future compatibility. However, this change demands verifying that your compiler and project settings meet the minimum C++17 standard.
