# Deprecation Notices

GoogleTest provides a streamlined way to track functions, APIs, or features that are scheduled for removal, ensuring users can proactively adapt their codebases. This page helps you understand which features are deprecated, why they are deprecated, what alternatives exist, and offers official migration paths. By following the recommended steps, you can future-proof your test codebase and maintain compatibility with upcoming versions.

## Understanding Deprecations

Deprecation signals that certain functionality in GoogleTest is no longer recommended for use and will be removed in a future release. The reasons may include improved APIs, better design patterns, security improvements, or simplification of the codebase.

When you encounter a deprecated feature, it is essential to:

- Identify the deprecated functions or APIs.
- Understand why they have been deprecated.
- Learn the suggested alternatives.
- Follow the official migration instructions to update your tests.

Ignoring deprecation warnings can lead to test failures or maintenance challenges when the feature is finally removed.

## Typical Features Subject to Deprecation

Deprecations typically involve:

- **Function APIs:** Older versions of functions that have improved replacements.
- **Macros:** Assertion or mocking macros replaced by more expressive or safer alternatives.
- **Test Structure Patterns:** Legacy patterns superseded by more effective test organization methods.

GoogleTest carefully documents deprecations and provides guidance around them to minimize disruption.

## How to Spot Deprecated Features

- Your compiler or test output may show warnings when using deprecated features.
- API documentation and release notes explicitly mark deprecated functions or macros.
- Deprecation messages often include recommendations on alternative usage.

## Official Migration Recommendations

GoogleTest emphasizes smooth transition paths with the following best practices:

1. **Review Release Notes and Changelogs:** Before upgrading the GoogleTest version, read deprecation notices outlined in release notes.
2. **Use Updated Macros and Functions:** Preferred new assertion macros and mocking patterns offer enhanced readability and reduced ambiguity.
3. **Remove Deprecated Calls Gradually:** Limit deprecated feature usage in new code and refactor existing tests incrementally.
4. **Validate Tests After Migration:** Run your test suites to confirm behavior remains correct after migrations.

### Example: Migrating from Old to New Assertion Macros

If a macro like `ASSERT_OLD_MACRO` is deprecated in favor of `ASSERT_NEW_MACRO`, follow these steps:

```cpp
// Deprecated usage (to be avoided)
ASSERT_OLD_MACRO(condition);

// Updated usage recommended by GoogleTest
ASSERT_NEW_MACRO(condition);
```

This change usually improves expressiveness or correctness.

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Tip:** Always check the official GoogleTest `reference` and `changelog` pages when upgrading to understand the current deprecation landscape.

- **Tip:** Avoid suppressing deprecation warnings; they are there to help you proactively update your code.

- **Pitfall:** Using deprecated APIs after their removal causes compilation errors and test failures.

- **Pitfall:** Some deprecated features might have subtle behavioral differences when replaced; thoroughly test after migration.
