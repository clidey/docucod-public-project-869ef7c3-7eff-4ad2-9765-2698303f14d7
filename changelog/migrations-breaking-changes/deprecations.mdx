# Deprecations & Removal Notices

This page is your go-to resource for staying informed about features, APIs, or platforms in GoogleMock that have been marked for deprecation or removal. By understanding these changes early, you can proactively update your tests and mocks to ensure future compatibility and adopt recommended alternatives.

## Understanding Deprecation and Removal

In the evolving landscape of GoogleMock, some features or APIs may be deprecated before eventual removal in a future release. Deprecation serves as a formal notice to users that a particular feature should no longer be used and that alternatives exist or will be provided.

### Why Pay Attention?

- **Avoid Breaking Changes**: Deprecated features can be removed without backward compatibility in upcoming releases.
- **Improve Code Quality**: Updated APIs offer better design, performance, or usability.
- **Smooth Migration**: Early awareness allows planned code updates and testing.

## Common Types of Deprecations

GoogleMock may mark the following for deprecation:

- **Mocking APIs and Macros**: Certain macros or usage patterns may be superseded by improved constructs.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Practices such as mixing old and new mocking styles or deprecated actions.
- **Platform Support or Flags**: Command-line flags or platform-specific features may be phased out.

## Scheduled Removal Timeline

GoogleMock follows a clear policy on deprecations:

- Once a feature is marked as deprecated, it remains supported for at least one major release.
- Warnings are issued at compile time or runtime to notify of deprecated usage.
- After the grace period, the feature is removed in a major release.

Keep an eye on the release notes and changelog sections for detailed timelines.

## Recommended Alternatives and Migration Guidance

Whenever a feature is deprecated, GoogleMock documentation provides:

- **Replacement APIs or Patterns**: For example, migrating from legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the modern `MOCK_METHOD`.
- **Migration Examples**: Sample code snippets highlighting how to update your mocks or expectations.
- **Best Practices**: Guidance on designing new mocks or structuring tests to avoid deprecated approaches.

### Example: Transitioning from Legacy MOCK_METHOD Macros

Legacy macros like `MOCK_METHOD0`, `MOCK_CONST_METHOD1`, etc., have been supplanted by the modern variadic `MOCK_METHOD` macro offering better type safety and flexibility.

```cpp
// Legacy style (deprecated)
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// Recommended modern style
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int), (override));
```

Migrating to the new macro improves compatibility and harnesses enhanced gMock capabilities.

## Common Pitfalls With Deprecated Features

- **Compiler Warnings or Errors**: Using deprecated features might trigger warnings or eventually errors.
- **Unexpected Behavior**: Deprecated constructs might not interact well with modern features, such as strict mocks or new cardinality specifications.
- **Maintenance Burden**: Legacy usage complicates test maintenance and impedes leveraging performance or usability improvements.

Avoid these issues by proactively refactoring deprecated test code.

## Staying Informed

- **Release Notes & Changelog**: Follow the official release notes for detailed deprecation notices.
- **Mocking Reference and Cookbook**: Consult updated recipes and API references for the latest recommended usage.
- **Compile-Time Warnings**: Enable verbose compiler warnings to capture deprecated usages early.

## Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues

If you encounter failures or warnings linked to deprecated features:

1. Review the relevant [Mocking Reference](../api-reference/mocking-api/mock-method-macro.md) for current best practice.
2. Search the [gMock FAQ](docs/gmock_faq.md) for similar cases.
3. Run your tests with the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to obtain detailed diagnostic output.
4. Consider using tools or IDE inspections that highlight deprecated code.

<Tip>
When updating legacy mocks, test iteratively and verify behavior remains correct after migration. This reduces risk and catches subtle issues early.

## Summary

This page empowers users to:

- Identify deprecated features in GoogleMock.
- Understand the impact and timing of removals.
- Apply recommended migration paths.
- Avoid common pitfalls of deprecated usage.

Staying ahead of deprecations ensures your mock-based tests remain reliable, maintainable, and compatible with future GoogleMock versions.
