# Breaking Changes Overview

This page highlights critical breaking changes introduced in various GoogleTest releases, focusing specifically on aspects that impact users' test code and build configurations. It details updates such as new compiler requirements, removed or replaced interfaces, and alterations in test behavior expectations. Designed to help developers quickly identify disruptions and required code updates, this overview ensures smoother migration between versions.

## Understanding Breaking Changes

When updating GoogleTest, it is vital to be aware of any changes that might interrupt your existing tests or build environments. This page provides a curated list of such changes per release, enabling you to anticipate and address compatibility issues efficiently.

### What Is a Breaking Change?

A breaking change is any modification in GoogleTest that renders previously valid test code or configurations invalid or behaviors different. Common examples include:

- Raising the minimum C++ standard requirements (e.g., moving to C++17).
- Removing, renaming, or replacing public API interfaces.
- Altering test assertion semantics or output formats.
- Changing expected behaviors in test execution or failure handling.

### Why Does Awareness Matter?

Being informed about breaking changes helps you:

- Plan upgrades with minimal disruption.
- Update test code to comply with new requirements.
- Avoid subtle bugs caused by altered test semantics.
- Leverage newly introduced features or policies effectively.

## Key Breaking Changes by Version

> *Note:* The exact list of breaking changes and their descriptions are typically detailed here per release, including migration guidance and code samples. Please refer to official release notes for precise information.

### Example: C++17 Standard Requirement

Starting from version 1.17.0, GoogleTest requires a minimum of **C++17** support from your compiler. This means:

- Your build system must be configured to enable C++17 or later.
- Older compilers lacking C++17 support are no longer compatible.

**Migration Tips:**

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Ensure your build scripts reflect this change to prevent compilation errors.

### Interface Removals or Replacements

With some updates, certain public APIs or macros may be deprecated or removed.

- Identify usages of removed interfaces in your tests.
- Review the recommended replacements or alternatives.
- Refactor your code accordingly to align with the latest API.

### Changes in Expected Test Behaviors

Some releases may alter how test assertions behave or how failures are reported.

- This might affect your test outcomes or failure handling logic.
- Re-execute your test suite after upgrades to detect any discrepancies.
- Adjust assertions or test logic if necessary.

## Troubleshooting Common Migration Issues

Here are practical tips for common challenges:

- **Compiler Errors Due to C++ Standard Mismatch:**
  - Ensure your compiler flag explicitly enables at least C++17.

- **Undefined Macros or Methods:**
  - Check if APIs have been removed and replace them with supported alternatives.

- **Test Failures Due to Behavioral Changes:**
  - Review test assertions around those features and update expectations accordingly.

- **Deprecation Warnings:**
  - Treat warnings seriously; deprecated features usually signal upcoming removals.
