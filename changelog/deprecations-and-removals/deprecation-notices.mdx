# Deprecation Notices

Stay ahead of changes in GoogleTest by monitoring the Deprecation Notices pageâ€”a centralized running log that clearly outlines APIs, features, or behaviors marked for removal in upcoming releases. This empowers your teams and projects to update proactively, minimizing disruption and maximizing compatibility.

## Purpose and Value

The Deprecation Notices page serves as your proactive alert system, detailing what parts of GoogleTest are deprecated, why they are deprecated, and most importantly, what you should use instead. By consulting this page regularly, you can:

- Avoid unexpected breakages by planning ahead for removals.
- Discover recommended alternatives or migration paths.
- Understand the timeline and severity of deprecations.

## Understanding Deprecations

GoogleTest evolves continuously, and deprecations are carefully introduced to phase out outdated or less effective features. This page makes those changes crystal clear by providing:

- **Identification of deprecated items:** Names of APIs, macros, or features that are slated for removal.
- **Recommended alternatives:** Guidance on modern replacements or better approaches.
- **Advance notice:** Timeline or release version notes to help prioritize updates.

## How to Use This Page Effectively

### 1. Check Notices Before Upgrading

Before updating to a new GoogleTest version, review the deprecation log here to identify potential impacts on your test code.

### 2. Prioritize Refactoring

Use the recommended alternatives listed in the notices to update your test code progressively, reducing technical debt and avoiding urgent fixes later.

### 3. Integrate Into Team Workflow

Embed review of this page in your CI/CD or release readiness process to keep all team members informed.

### 4. Stay Informed with Related Documentation

- For detailed deprecation impact and migration steps, see [Breaking Changes](../breaking-migrations/breaking-changes).
- To understand macro replacements and test fixture changes, consult the [Migration Guides](../breaking-migrations/migration-guides).

## Sample Deprecation Entries

GoogleTest occasionally flags several components for deprecation; here are illustrative examples with actionable advice:

```cpp
[[deprecated("INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P is deprecated, please use INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P")]]
constexpr bool InstantiateTestCase_P_IsDeprecated() { return true; }

[[deprecated("TYPED_TEST_CASE_P is deprecated, please use TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P")]]
constexpr bool TypedTestCase_P_IsDeprecated() { return true; }

[[deprecated("REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P is deprecated, please use REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P")]]
constexpr bool RegisterTypedTestCase_P_IsDeprecated() { return true; }
```

### What You Should Do

- Replace all `INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P` uses with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Replace all `TYPED_TEST_CASE_P` with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Replace all `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P` with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

These changes ensure that your test suites conform to the current GoogleTest APIs and avoid build warnings or failures.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Do not ignore deprecation warnings.** They indicate upcoming removals that could break your test builds.
- **Migrate early in your development cycle** to leverage improvements and avoid legacy traps.
- **Test thoroughly after migrations** to catch subtle test behavior changes.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If you see deprecation warnings during compilation, identify the exact macro or API causing it by inspecting warning messages.
- Consult the migration guides for precise code transformations and backward compatibility advice.
- For complex codebases, consider automated refactoring tools or scripts to update deprecated macros systematically.

## Final Notes

This page is your trusted resource to track GoogleTest deprecations and ensure that your code remains up-to-date and reliable. Regular consultation and adherence to the recommended migration paths protect your projects from unexpected breaks and help you leverage the latest improvements GoogleTest offers.

### Sample Migration Snippet

If you have legacy code like this:

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P(MyInstantiation, MyTestSuite, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```
Replace it with:

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyInstantiation, MyTestSuite, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

### Summary
- Deprecations come with advance notice and guide you towards better APIs.
- Update test code promptly using recommended alternatives.
- Use this page alongside migration guides and breaking changes references.
