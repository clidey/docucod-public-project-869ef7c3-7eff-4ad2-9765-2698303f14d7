# Breaking Changes Summary

The 'Breaking Changes Summary' page serves as a critical guide for users upgrading GoogleTest across recent versions. It enumerates the most significant breaking changes, outlining how these modifications may impact your test code, dependencies, or build integrations. This documentation empowers developers to anticipate and manage potential migration challenges, ensuring a smooth transition to newer releases without disrupting their testing workflows.

---

## Understanding Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are updates in GoogleTest that modify existing behaviors, interfaces, or APIs in a way that could cause previously working tests to fail or require adjustments. This summary focuses on changes that demand explicit attention and adaptation by test authors or integrators.

Users should pay close attention to these changes before upgrading, as ignoring them may lead to unexpected test failures or integration issues.

## Notable Breaking Changes in Recent Releases

### 1. Mock Method Declaration and Usage

- **MOCK_METHOD Macro Improvements:** Transition from old-style `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the new generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro introduces a standardized syntax, with enhanced support for qualifiers such as `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, and call types. Tests using legacy macros should migrate for compatibility and maintainability.

- **Parent Class Mock Methods:** Strict enforcement that `MOCK_METHOD` macros affect only methods declared directly in the mock class. Mock overrides inherited from base mock classes may not be affected by `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers, potentially changing warning/error behaviors related to uninteresting calls.

- **Access Specifiers:** Mock methods must be declared `public` regardless of the access level of the original methods they override. Tests failing due to access violations should refactor mock classes accordingly.

### 2. Strictness Modes

- **Default Behavior Adjustment:** The default mock behavior remains `NaggyMock` (warnings on uninteresting calls). Users can opt-in manually to `NiceMock` (suppresses warnings) or `StrictMock` (treats uninteresting calls as errors). Upgrading users should explicitly verify their preferred strictness mode.

- **Limitations:** `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` only reliably affect mock methods defined directly with `MOCK_METHOD` in the mock class, not inherited ones. There's no support for nesting these wrappers (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockFoo>>`).

---

### 3. Expectation and Action Semantics

- **New `EXPECT_CALL` Matching Rules:** The search order of expectations has been standardized to find the most recent match first. Users defining multiple `EXPECT_CALL`s with overlapping matchers are advised to consider the order carefully or use sequences for ordered expectations.

- **Construction and Destruction of Mocks:** To improve compile times and maintain test stability, defining mock class constructors and destructors out of line, in `.cc` files, is recommended for large mocks. This strategy helps prevent repeated expensive code generation.

- **Default Values and Actions:** The `ON_CALL` macros have expanded capabilities to define default behaviors for mock methods without setting strict expectations, encouraging better test resilience.

---

### 4. Action and Matcher Enhancements

- **Support for Move-Only Types:** GoogleMock now supports mocking methods with move-only parameters (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) and return types, allowing modern C++ idioms and patterns. Legacy workarounds are still valid but discouraged.

- **Polymorphic Matchers and Actions:** Improved support for polymorphic matchers allows greater flexibility in expectation definitions, enabling matchers that can adapt to different argument types. Users should use new `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, and action templates when defining custom behaviors.

---

### 5. Test Lifecycle and Interface

- **Virtual Destructor Enforcement:** Mocked interfaces and base classes should have virtual destructors to avoid undefined behavior and heap errors when deleting derived mock objects via base pointers.

- **Matchers and Actions Stability:** Matchers must be purely functional without side-effects and cannot call mock functions internally. This change enforces cleaner test semantics and prevents subtle errors.

- **Deprecation of Legacy Macros:** Old `MOCK_METHODn` macros and related legacy matcher/action macros remain supported but are deprecated. Tests should progressively migrate to the new interface to ensure future compatibility.

---

## Migration Guidance

To adapt your test code and build processes to these breaking changes:

1. **Review Mock Classes:** Ensure mock methods use the new `MOCK_METHOD` macro syntax, declare mocked methods `public`, and verify constructor/destructor definitions.
2. **Adjust Strictness Wrappers:** Explicitly wrap mocks with `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` if you require specific strictness behaviors.
3. **Update Expectations:** When using `EXPECT_CALL`, account for the matching precedence and ordering; use `InSequence` or `After` clauses when order matters.
4. **Handle Move-Only Types Properly:** Use lambdas or compatible actions to mock methods with move-only types.
5. **Verify Virtual Destructors:** Add virtual destructors to interfaces used in mocks to avoid memory and lifetime issues.
6. **Leverage New Actions and Matchers:** Replace legacy macros with new matcher and action templates to unlock advanced mocking features.

<Tip>
Always verify your test suite with verbose logging enabled (`--gmock_verbose=info`) after upgrading to catch subtle mismatches related to strictness or expectations.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Breakage

- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:** Lazily add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` or switch to `NiceMock` to suppress if the calls are harmless and expected.

- **Unexpected Call Failures:** Review argument matchers and sequence clauses; incorrect ordering often causes failures.

- **Compiler Errors with Move-Only Types:** Use lambda or function-based actions instead of `Return` with move-only values.

- **Linker Errors on Mock Types:** Confirm that mocks have default constructors and destructors defined, preferably out of line in `.cc` files.

- **Virtual Destructor Errors:** Add virtual destructors to base classes or interfaces involved in mocking.
