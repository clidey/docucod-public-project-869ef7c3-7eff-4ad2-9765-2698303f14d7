# Breaking Changes

This page provides a comprehensive overview of all breaking changes introduced across GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. It is designed to help you understand what has changed, why these changes were necessary, and how you can adjust your code and tests to adapt smoothly.

## Understanding Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are modifications in the API, behavior, or expected usage that may cause your existing tests or mocks to stop compiling, fail, or behave differently without recompilation. GoogleTest aims to minimize these, but some changes are essential to improve the framework’s correctness, security, or performance.

When a breaking change occurs, it typically affects one or more of the following aspects:

- **API signatures:** Changes in function parameters, macro behavior, or class interfaces
- **Behavioral modifications:** Altered default behaviors, execution order, or test lifecycle
- **Deprecations:** Removal or replacement of features in favor of better alternatives

Understanding these changes early helps you update your tests with minimal disruption.

## Format of Each Breaking Change Entry

Each breaking change summarized includes:

- **Affected APIs or features**: The specific classes, functions, macros, or flags involved.
- **Description of the change**: What has changed and why.
- **Migration guidance**: Steps, tips, or links to migration examples to help you adapt your code.

This structure ensures you get actionable insights that directly address your upgrade needs.

## Recent Breaking Changes Summary

### Change: Minimum C++ Standard Requirement Raised to C++17

- **Affected:** Entire GoogleTest and GoogleMock codebase
- **Description:** Starting with release 1.17.x, GoogleTest requires compiling with at least the C++17 standard. This change enables improved language features and safer, more robust implementations internally.
- **Migration Guidance:**
  - Ensure your build environment supports C++17 or higher.
  - Update your compiler flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).
  - Refer to [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](../../getting_started/setup_requirements/prerequisites_platforms) for detailed platform-specific guidance.

### Change: Removal of Deprecated `TestCase` API

- **Affected:** Test suite declarations and legacy code
- **Description:** The older `TestCase` API has been fully replaced by `TestSuite`. Usage of `TestCase` is removed for consistency and alignment with current terminology.
- **Migration Guidance:** 
  - Replace all instances of `TestCase` with `TestSuite`.
  - Use `TEST_SUITE` macros and APIs as detailed in [Writing and Organizing Tests](../../api-reference/core-testing-apis/writing-tests).

### Change: Updated Macro Parameter Parsing in MOCK_METHOD

- **Affected:** Mock class method definitions using `MOCK_METHOD`
- **Description:** Changes in parsing rules require that complex argument types containing commas be wrapped in extra parentheses or aliased with a `using` statement. This ensures correct parsing and macro expansion.
- **Migration Guidance:**
  - Wrap argument types containing commas in parentheses, e.g., `MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<int, int>), Fun, ());`
  - Alternatively, define type aliases for complex types before usage.
  - Consult the [Defining and Using Mocks](../../api-reference/mocking-apis/defining-mocks) page for detailed examples.

### Change: Deprecated Macros and Removal of Legacy Features

- **Affected:** Various assertion macros and internal utility functions
- **Description:** Certain macros and utility functions declared as deprecated in earlier releases have been removed.
- **Migration Guidance:**
  - Replace deprecated macros with preferred current alternatives (e.g., use `TEST_SUITE` instead of legacy macros).
  - Review your code for any legacy or internal calls.

### Change: Strict Enforcement of Exception Availability Macros

- **Affected:** Exception handling control macros
- **Description:** The detection and flag `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` behavior has been updated to more strictly reflect whether C++ exceptions are enabled in the build.
- **Migration Guidance:**
  - Explicitly define `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` to `1` or `0` in build configurations if your environment doesn’t support automatic detection.
  - Check the [Platform Portability and Configuration Flags](../../api-reference/configuration-runtime/portability-config) documentation for environment variable usage.

## Navigating Breaking Changes

To minimize disruption when upgrading:

1. **Review the changelog for your target release:** Understand all breaking changes introduced since your current version.

2. **Plan your migration:** Identify affected tests or mocks and prepare code updates accordingly.

3. **Test incrementally:** Post-update, run tests and mocks incrementally to detect any unintended breakage.

4. **Consult migration guides:** Use release-specific migration examples when available.

<Tip>
When maintaining large codebases with extensive GoogleTest usage, consider upgrading to the latest compatible version incrementally and keeping track of breaking changes documented here to ensure smooth transitions.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Compilation errors due to C++ standard mismatch

- **Symptom:** Compilation fails citing unsupported language features or invalid syntax.
- **Cause:** Your compiler is set to a C++ standard lower than C++17.
- **Solution:**
  - Update your build system compiler flags to use `-std=c++17` or higher.
  - Verify compiler version compatibility; see [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](../../getting_started/setup_requirements/prerequisites_platforms).

### Issue: Mock methods with comma-containing argument types fail to expand

- **Symptom:** Macro expansion errors in `MOCK_METHOD` declarations.
- **Cause:** Missing parentheses around complex argument types.
- **Solution:**
  - Wrap such argument types in parentheses or alias them with `using` declarations.
  - See documentation examples in [Defining and Using Mocks](../../api-reference/mocking-apis/defining-mocks#MOCK_METHOD).

### Issue: Tests fail due to removed deprecated API

- **Symptom:** Linker errors or compilation errors referencing `TestCase` or other deprecated types.
- **Cause:** Upgraded to a version where deprecated APIs are no longer supported.
- **Solution:**
  - Replace deprecated usage with current `TestSuite` APIs.
  - Consult the updated [Test Suite API](../../api-reference/core-testing-apis/writing-tests).

<Tip>
Always back up your current test code before beginning major upgrades. Use the GoogleTest continuous integration instructions to automate regression detection during migration.

## Why Breaking Changes Are Necessary

GoogleTest maintains a balance between stability and progress. Some breaking changes are unavoidable to:

- Introduce modern C++ language features and remove legacy support
- Fix longstanding bugs or vulnerabilities
- Improve performance and scalability
- Enhance API expressiveness and user ergonomics

GoogleTest announces such changes clearly in changelogs and provides migration guidance to smooth your upgrade path.

## Summary

This page is essential for developers maintaining GoogleTest-based test suites, especially when upgrading versions. It combines clarity on what breaking changes were introduced, their purpose, and actionable migration advice, empowering you to confidently keep your tests up-to-date and reliable.
