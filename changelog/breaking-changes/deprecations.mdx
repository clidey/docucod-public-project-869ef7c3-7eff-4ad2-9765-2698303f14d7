# Deprecations & Removal Notices

The "Deprecations & Removal Notices" page details all features, APIs, and functionalities within GoogleTest and GoogleMock that are deprecated, along with their planned removal timelines. This empowers users to anticipate upcoming changes and formulate effective strategies for code refactoring to maintain compatibility and avoid disruptions.

---

## Understanding Deprecations

As GoogleTest evolves, certain features and APIs may be marked as deprecated. A deprecation indicates that a particular feature is obsolete and will be removed in future releases. It serves as an advance warning for users to transition their codebases away from deprecated components.

### Why Deprecations Matter

- **Maintain Forward Compatibility**: Deprecated features suggest users modify code to keep up-to-date with best practices and framework improvements.
- **Prevent Future Breakages**: Eliminating deprecated features from your tests now prevents unexpected failures during future upgrades.
- **Leverage New Features**: Transitioning from deprecated APIs often unlocks better tooling, performance, and usability.


## Deprecation Listings and Removal Timelines

This page systematically lists each deprecated item, specifying:

- The **deprecated feature or API**
- The **version when it was deprecated**
- Its **planned removal version or timeline**
- **Suggested alternatives or migration instructions**

Users can use this information to schedule refactorings appropriately and ensure their test code remains robust across GoogleTest versions.

### Example Entry
```markdown
- **MOCK_METHODn family macros**
  - *Deprecated since*: 1.10.0
  - *Removal scheduled for*: 2.0.0
  - *Alternative*: Use the generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro which provides a more consistent and flexible syntax.
```

## Best Practices for Handling Deprecations

- **Review Deprecated Features Regularly**: Check this page and release notes before upgrading GoogleTest.
- **Plan and Prioritize Migration**: Start migrating deprecated features early, especially if they have a near-term removal date.
- **Test Thoroughly During Migration**: Use GoogleTest’s rich assertion and mocking features to validate migration impacts.
- **Leverage Migration Guides**: Utilize detailed upgrade guides and migration tips published alongside deprecation announcements.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Deprecations**: Postponing changes can lead to build failures or test breakages when deprecated features are removed.
- **Partial Migrations**: Incomplete migration can result in subtle test failures or compatibility issues.

## Planning Code Refactoring

GoogleTest encourages users to proactively refactor tests when encountering deprecations. This can include:
- Switching to newer APIs such as replacing legacy mock macros with `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Updating expectation and action styles in mock objects based on newer syntax.
- Adopting modern assertion macros or matchers that enhance readability and expressiveness.
