# Planned Changes & Roadmap Highlights

This page shares advance notice of upcoming changes to GoogleTest and GoogleMock, such as new dependencies, architectural shifts, or planned major features. Its goal is to equip users and contributors with early insight so they can align development strategies, integration plans, and testing workflows to minimize disruption and maximize compatibility.

---

## 1. Overview of Upcoming Changes

GoogleTest and GoogleMock continue evolving to improve usability, extend platform support, and enhance testing capabilities. This page details anticipated modifications that may affect your project planning:

- Introduction of new dependencies or updated third-party libraries.
- Changes in architecture that influence integration or extension points.
- Planned major features targeting scalability, performance, or usability.

By understanding these changes ahead of time, you can prepare your codebases, CI systems, and test suites accordingly.

## 2. Dependency Updates

Future releases of GoogleTest may introduce or require newer versions of third-party dependencies to take advantage of enhancements in:

- C++ Standards Compliance: Enforcing or leveraging newer C++17 or later features for better reliability and maintainability.
- Core Libraries: Upgrading Abseil (Absl) or RE2 libraries for improved string formatting, regular expression support, or utilities.
- Build Systems: Enhancements in build configuration scripts to support contemporary CMake or Bazel feature sets.

**Tip:** Ensure your build environment and toolchains are up-to-date to smoothly adopt these upcoming dependency changes.

## 3. Architectural Shifts

Planned changes to the internal architecture of GoogleTest and GoogleMock focus on:

- Modularization: Improving separation of concerns to facilitate extensions and embedding.
- Enhanced Event Listener APIs: Offering more granular hooks for monitoring test execution and results.
- Thread-Safety Enhancements: Increasing robustness of death tests and multi-threaded test cases.

These shifts maintain the same external APIs but optimize for future scalability and maintainability.

## 4. Planned Major Features

Several key features are in development or planned for future releases, including:

- Advanced Mock Object Capabilities: Supporting even more flexible mocking patterns such as refined move-only argument handling and custom matcher enhancements.
- Expanded Parameterized and Typed Test Facilities: Enabling more expressive and convenient ways to write scalable, reusable tests.
- Improved Reporting and Output Options: JSON and XML output enhancements for better CI/CD integration.
- Better Support for Embedded and Cross-Platform Testing Environments: Including new portability flags and example integrations.

These features aim to improve productivity, test coverage, and integration ease for a wide range of users.

## 5. Preparing for Breaking Changes

While this page highlights future improvements, the GoogleTest team commits to minimizing breaking changes. When unavoidable, changes will be clearly communicated with corresponding migration guides referencing the [Breaking Changes Summary](/changelog/breaking-changes-and-migrations/breaking-changes-summary) and [Migration Guides](/changelog/breaking-changes-and-migrations/migration-guides).

**Recommendations:**

- Track the official [Full Version History](/changelog/release-notes-and-version-history/full-version-history) for detailed version updates.
- Review deprecation notices promptly at [Deprecations & Removals](/changelog/deprecations-and-future-plans/deprecations-list).
- Test your projects with release candidates and betas as they become available.

## 6. Impact on Users and Contributors

### For Users:

- Stay informed to avoid surprises when updating GoogleTest.
- Utilize new features to write more robust and maintainable tests.
- Monitor environment prerequisites and update dependencies accordingly.

### For Contributors:

- Coordinate contributions with evolving architecture to avoid conflicts.
- Check upcoming API changes and planned extensions for compatibility.
- Engage in community discussions for feedback on proposed roadmap items.

## 7. Staying Updated and Providing Feedback

We encourage the community to stay connected and contribute feedback:

- Participate in GitHub issues and pull requests to discuss and influence planned enhancements.
- Subscribe to mailing lists and forums outlined in [Where to Get Help](/faq/community-and-support/where-to-get-help).
