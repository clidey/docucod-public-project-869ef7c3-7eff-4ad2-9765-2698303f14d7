# Deprecations & Removals

This page helps you keep your GoogleTest and GoogleMock codebases up to date by clearly listing features, APIs, and build options that are currently *deprecated*. It includes timelines for removal, guidance on how to migrate, and references to supported alternatives. By reviewing this information, you can proactively update your tests to avoid interruptions caused by breaking changes in the future.

---

## Understanding Deprecations

Deprecated features are those that GoogleTest no longer recommends and will remove in forthcoming releases. These warnings prevent surprises by giving users ample time to transition their code. Regularly reviewing this page is crucial to maintain compatibility with future GoogleTest versions.

- **Deprecation Timeline**: Each deprecated item includes timelines indicating when it was deprecated and when removal is expected.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Where applicable, links to recommended alternatives or replacement APIs are provided.
- **Impact Assessment**: Descriptions focus on the user impact, helping you understand which parts of your code or build setups could be affected.

## Common Deprecated Areas Covered

This page focuses specifically on deprecations affecting:

- Test macros and assertion APIs
- Mocking macros and configurations
- Build system options, especially CMake flags
- Compiler or runtime flags related to test builds

## How to Use This Page

When you visit this page, follow these steps to manage deprecations proactively:

1. **Review the List of Deprecated Items**: Check for any features or options currently marked as deprecated.
2. **Note the Removal Schedule**: Understand when these are planned for removal to prioritize your migration efforts.
3. **Follow Migration Guidance**: Use the provided links and instructions to switch to supported alternatives.
4. **Test Your Changes**: Run your test suites to ensure smooth transitions without regressions.

## Example Deprecated Features

While this page details the full list (which evolves over time), here are common examples to illustrate the type of information you'll find:

### 1. Old Mocking Macros

- **Deprecated**: The old family of `MOCK_METHODn` macros (e.g., `MOCK_METHOD1`, `MOCK_CONST_METHOD1`)
- **Why**: They are replaced by the newer, more flexible `MOCK_METHOD` macro that handles qualifiers and overloads better.
- **Migration**: Replace `MOCK_METHODn(ReturnType, MethodName, (Args...));` with `MOCK_METHOD(ReturnType, MethodName, (Args...), (qualifiers));`
- **Removal Timeline**: Deprecated since v1.x, removal planned in a major future release.

### 2. Build Option Flags

- **Deprecated**: Older CMake options influencing runtime linkage, e.g., `gtest_force_shared_crt` flag usage
- **Reason**: Updated build system configurations provide better cross-platform consistency.
- **Migration**: Use the latest documented CMake options available in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md#generic-build-instructions).

### 3. Unused or Obsolete Flags

- Flags associated with non-supported platforms or legacy threading models are deprecated.

## Tips for a Smooth Migration

- Always test your test code after changing deprecated APIs.
- Use CMake's `find_package` and targets like `GTest::gtest` to link instead of manual flag settings.
- Replace deprecated mocking macros promptly to benefit from enhanced diagnostics and functionality.
- Follow the [GoogleTest Release Notes & Version History](../release-notes-and-version-history/full-version-history) page to track upcoming important removals and plan upgrades.

## Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues

- If your build breaks after updating GoogleTest, verify if it uses any deprecated features listed here.
- Consult the [Breaking Changes Summary](../breaking-changes-and-migrations/breaking-changes-summary) for details on removals.
- For migration help, see the [Upgrade & Migration Guides](../breaking-changes-and-migrations/migration-guides).
- Reach out via the [Community Support Channels](../../faq/community-and-support/where-to-get-help) if unclear about migration paths.
