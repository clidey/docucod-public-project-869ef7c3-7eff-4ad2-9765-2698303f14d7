# Bug Fixes & Patch Notes

The **Bug Fixes & Patch Notes** page provides a detailed, chronological record of bugs resolved and minor corrections made in each release of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. By itemizing fixes with references to the affected modules or workflows, this resource allows teams and developers to quickly verify when critical issues relevant to their use cases have been addressed.

---

## Purpose and Usage

This page serves as the authoritative source for understanding specific bug fixes and patch updates per release. Whether you are troubleshooting unexpected test behavior or verifying that a previously reported defect has been patched, this changelog helps you:

- Identify releases that contain fixes impacting your tests or mocked components.
- Track improvements in the mocking framework, assertion macros, test execution, and other critical workflows.
- Confirm whether upgrade efforts will resolve known issues.

## How to Navigate This Page

Fixes are presented in reverse chronological order, with the most recent releases first, enabling you to find the latest corrections immediately. Each entry includes:

- **Version and Release Date:** Clearly marked so you know when the fix became available.
- **Issue Description:** Concise explanation of the problem, framed in user impact terms.
- **Affected Modules or Workflows:** Indicators of which features (e.g., mock classes, expectations, test runners) were involved.
- **Resolution Details:** Summary of what was corrected, often with guidance for affected users.

## Examples of Typical Bug Fixes Covered

While this page does **not** delve into source code implementations, it highlights the practical effects of fixes such as:

- Correction of misbehavior in `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` usages that caused false failures or incorrect mock call handling.
- Resolving issues where mock method call counts were miscounted, leading to test failures or missed failures.
- Fixes to verbose flag handling (`--gmock_verbose`) ensuring accurate and useful output during test execution.
- Addressing cases where mock objects were leaked or their expectations not properly verified upon object destruction.
- Improvements to managing sequences and call ordering when mixing multiple mock objects.

## Best Practices for Addressing Bug Fixes

- Review the fix notes to determine if your current version may be impacted.
- Upgrade to the specified version to incorporate the fixes, following [Migration Guides](../breaking-changes-migrations/migration-guides).
- Re-run your tests post-upgrade to confirm issues are resolved.
- Consult related documentation, especially on [Mocking Basics](../../guides/mocking-and-advanced-techniques/mocking-basics) and [Configuring Actions & Expectations](../../guides/mocking-and-advanced-techniques/actions-and-expectations) to verify proper use patterns and avoid common pitfalls.

## Troubleshooting and Additional Support

If unexpected test failures or warnings persist after applying fixes, consider:

- Verifying your mock objects have virtual destructors as recommended in the [Legacy gMock FAQ](../../docs/gmock_faq.md).
- Increasing the verbosity level using the `--gmock_verbose` flag (info, warning, error) to gain insights into mock function call matching and warnings.
- Reading the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](../../getting-started/first-steps-usage/troubleshooting-setup) guide for common installation and configuration problems.
- Checking the [Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls](../../docs/gmock_cook_book.md#NiceStrictNaggy) section for understanding warning and error messages.

## Example Snippet of a Bug Fix Entry (Illustrative)

> ### 1.12.1 (2024-04-15)
>
> - Fixed an issue where repeated calls to mock methods using `WillOnce()` exhausted actions prematurely, causing unexpected default return values and test failures.
> - Corrected verbose output handling under the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to provide clearer call traces and expectation matches.
> - Resolved leaks for mock objects created in tests but not properly cleaned up, improving heap checker compatibility.
>
> Users facing these issues should upgrade to 1.12.1 or later and consult the Migration Guides for any compatibility notes.
