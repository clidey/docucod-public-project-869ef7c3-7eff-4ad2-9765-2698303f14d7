# Version History

GoogleTest's **Version History** page provides a clear, organized, and chronological record of all released versions of the framework. This page empowers users to track the evolution of GoogleTest by listing every release with its version number, official release date, and direct links to detailed release notes. By referring to this history, users can quickly identify when features, fixes, or breaking changes were introduced, enabling informed decisions about upgrades and integrations.

## Understanding the Version History Page

The Version History page is designed with user intent at its core: making it simple for developers and teams to understand the progression of the GoogleTest framework over time. Here you will find:

- **Chronological Release List**: All GoogleTest releases presented in reverse chronological order, ensuring that the most recent updates are immediately accessible.
- **Version Numbers**: Clearly marked semantic versioning (e.g., v1.17.0) that reflects the nature of changes — whether they are major, minor, or patches.
- **Release Dates**: Exact dates when each version was published, helping users correlate the timeline with their own project milestones.
- **Links to Release Notes**: Each version entry includes a direct link to the official GitHub release notes, where you can explore comprehensive details about new features, improvements, fixes, and any breaking changes.

This structure allows users to scan release history efficiently and drill down into details relevant to their specific needs.
