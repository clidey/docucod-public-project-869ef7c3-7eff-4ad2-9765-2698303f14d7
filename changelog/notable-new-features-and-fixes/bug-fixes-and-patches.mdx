# Bug Fixes and Patches

This page provides a clear, transparent log of bug fixes, resolved regressions, and maintenance-level patches delivered in each GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. The goal is to keep users informed about improvements that enhance stability, usability, and edge-case handling without introducing new features.

---

## Understanding Bug Fixes and Patches

GoogleTest and its mocking framework GoogleMock continuously evolve through community feedback and internal quality control. Bug fixes typically address stability issues, unexpected behavior, failed test cases due to regressions, and error handling improvements. Patches may also fine-tune existing functionality for correctness and performance.

This changelog section focuses exclusively on fixes rather than new APIs or feature enhancements. It is crucial for users to review these details to understand resolved issues that may affect their test suites or integration.

## Recent Bug Fix Highlights

### Fixes in GoogleMock Uninteresting Calls Handling

- **Correct handling of uninteresting calls in different mock strictness modes.** Fixes were made to ensure that NiceMock suppresses warnings and NaggyMock properly logs warnings as expected.
- **Improved diagnostics when unexpected or excessive calls occur**, providing users with more actionable and clear error messages.
- **Resolved corner cases where uninteresting calls that delete their mocks produced inconsistent or missing warnings/errors.** This strengthens test reliability and log clarity.

### Constructor and Destructor Handling

- Fixed issues with mocks having non-default constructors to work seamlessly with NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock wrappers.
- Added safety for mocks calling methods within destructors, ensuring no spurious warnings or crashes during object teardown.

### Flag Parsing and Initialization

- Enhanced command-line flag parsing (`--gmock_verbose`, `--gmock_default_mock_behavior`, `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks`), handling edge cases with incomplete or malformed flags.
- Improved integration with Google Test initialization to prevent flag conflicts and streamline test environment setup.

### Output and Logging Corrections

- Fixed output messages in verbose modes to correctly represent call expectations, mismatches, and ordering issues.
- Corrected handling of default actions attached with `ON_CALL` to prevent confusing logs during unexpected or uninteresting calls.

### Leak Detection Improvements

- Addressed subtle scenarios where leaked mocks could be missed or incorrectly reported, improving memory leak detection accuracy.

### Compatibility and Build Fixes

- Resolved platform-specific glitches in mock framework initialization and teardown, supporting more stable cross-platform behavior.
- Adjusted macro usage and template implementations to fix build warnings and minor compilation errors on modern compilers.

## Best Practices to Leverage These Fixes

- **Update to the latest release** to incorporate critical stability and correctness patches.
- Use **verbose logging modes** to observe detailed behavior in mocks, especially when diagnosing unexpected or uninteresting calls.
- When using **StrictMock**, verify that all expected calls are specified to avoid test failures due to unanticipated calls â€” patch fixes make error reporting more precise.
- Review any **custom mock destructors** to ensure they operate safely during teardown.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues Addressed

- **Unexpected warnings from uninteresting calls** no longer occur when using NiceMock, reducing noise in test logs.
- Tests failing due to incorrect **mock method calls after destruction** have improved stability.
- Edge cases in **mock constructor forwarding** with non-default constructors no longer cause unexpected crashes or failures.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/common-issues) page for more detailed guidance on addressing test failures and configuration errors that may relate to previous bugs fixed.
