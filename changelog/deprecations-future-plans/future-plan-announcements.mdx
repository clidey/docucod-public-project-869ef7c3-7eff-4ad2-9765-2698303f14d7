# Future Plans & Roadmap Highlights

GoogleTest continuously evolves to enhance usability, reliability, and integration with modern C++ ecosystems. This page outlines the major forward-looking changes and upcoming dependencies, helping users anticipate what’s next and prepare their projects accordingly.

## 1. Upcoming Major Changes

### 1.1 Integration with Abseil

One of the key future directions is the planned formal dependency on the [Abseil C++ Common Libraries](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp). This integration aims to:

- Leverage Abseil's utilities for string formatting, optional types, and synchronization primitives.
- Improve consistency with other Google open source projects.
- Streamline internal implementation for better maintainability.

**User Impact:**

- Users will need to add Abseil as a build dependency in upcoming releases.
- Adapt code that integrates tightly with GoogleTest internals, as some implementation details may change.
- Benefit from improved diagnostics and portable abstractions via Abseil.

**Preparatory Steps:**

- Monitor the Abseil repository and documentation to familiarize yourself with its APIs.
- Review your build configurations to plan adding Abseil support.
- Use the latest pre-release builds when available to validate your projects.

### 1.2 Mandatory C++17 Standard Enforcement

Building on previous releases’ move to C++17, the next major versions will fully enforce this as the minimum standard, dropping support for earlier versions of C++.

**User Impact:**

- Ensure your compiler and toolchain support C++17 or later.
- Update any code relying on deprecated or removed C++14/11 features.

### 1.3 Unified Distribution

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have already been combined into a single repository and distribution. Future releases will deepen this unification, simplifying dependency handling and packaging.

## 2. Preparing Your Projects

To smoothly adopt upcoming versions and features:

- **Track the repository and release announcements.** Follow the official repository and relevant changelog pages.
- **Test builds with pre-release versions.** Early testing can surface potential integration issues.
- **Upgrade build environments.** Install and configure Abseil and ensure C++17 compliance.
- **Review usage of internal APIs.** Code that depends on internal implementation details may require adaptation.

<Tip>
To avoid surprises, keep your test programs and build scripts up to date and aligned with current GoogleTest recommendations and best practices.

## 3. Roadmap Highlights

### 3.1 Enhanced Diagnostics

Upcoming improvements aim to provide richer failure messages and increased debug information by harnessing Abseil’s formatting tools and advanced logging facilities.

### 3.2 Improved Integration with Build Systems

Plans include better CMake and Bazel build support for modular dependencies, easing integration in complex projects.

### 3.3 Expanded Platform Support and Portability

Continued efforts to ensure seamless operation across platforms and compilers supported by C++17.

## 4. How This Page Fits Within Documentation

This roadmap overview complements the existing changelog, upgrade guides, and deprecation notices, providing strategic context rather than code-level details. Users are encouraged to use this page to anticipate change and reference detailed migration and deprecation instructions as they become available.

## 6. Summary

GoogleTest is evolving to embrace modern C++ standards and improve integration with Google's broader open-source ecosystem through Abseil. Preparing projects by aligning with C++17, introducing Abseil dependency management, and anticipating API stabilizations will ensure smooth transitions. Users should leverage this knowledge alongside upgrade guides and changelog entries for practical implementation.
