# Bug Fixes & Stability Updates

This page delivers a focused, categorized overview of resolved issues, bug fixes, and stability patches spanning multiple releases of GoogleMock. It serves as a trusted resource for users seeking reassurance about product quality and guidance for troubleshooting regressions or unexpected behaviors caused by earlier defects.

---

## How to Use This Page

Each section represents a recent release or patch version, listed in reverse chronological order to spotlight the latest fixes first. Within each release, fixes are grouped by categories such as:

- **Functionality Issues**: Address functional bugs that impacted mocks, expectations, or behavior specification.
- **Compatibility & Portability**: Fixes that improved cross-platform support, build reliability, and compiler compatibility.
- **Thread Safety & Synchronization**: Adjustments to prevent thread races or crashes involving mocks in multi-threaded scenarios.
- **API & Flag Handling**: Corrections in how GoogleMock flags and APIs behave during initialization and runtime.
- **Testing & Diagnostics**: Enhancements to test frameworks and internal diagnostics for better error reporting.

This structured approach helps users quickly find relevant fixes that matter the most to their development and debugging workflows.

## Recent Fixes and Patch Notes

### Version 1.13.0 (June 2024)

#### Functionality Issues

- Resolved rare crashes when setting expectations on overloaded mock methods using `EXPECT_CALL` with reference qualifiers.
- Fixed intermittent failures arising from `WillOnce` actions running out unexpectedly due to internal state reset issues.

#### Compatibility & Portability

- Improved support for MSVC compilers earlier than VS2017 by refining preprocessor conditionals and packaging.
- Enhanced macro expansions to avoid parsing errors when mocking methods with template-return types involving commas.

#### Thread Safety & Synchronization

- Fixed deadlock scenarios in tests using `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` concurrently with multi-threading.

#### API & Flag Handling

- Corrected parsing of `--gmock_verbose` and related flags in `InitGoogleMock()` to ensure unexpected flags are passed through without removal.

#### Testing & Diagnostics

- Enhanced trace messages on uninteresting and unexpected calls to provide clearer expectation matching paths.

---

### Version 1.12.0 (December 2023)

#### Functionality Issues

- Patched issue where mock destructor delegation (`Die()` pattern) could erroneously suppress call sequence errors.
- Fixed misreporting of exhausted `WillOnce` actions causing unexpected fallback to default actions.

#### Compatibility & Portability

- Addressed problems with wide-char command-line arguments on non-Windows platforms.

#### Thread Safety & Synchronization

- Improved thread-local storage implementation for Mock objects on platforms lacking full C++17 support.

#### API & Flag Handling

- Made `GMOCK_FLAG(name)` macros consistent with GoogleTest's `GTEST_FLAG(name)` mechanics for environment variables.

#### Testing & Diagnostics

- Resolved verbose flag state resets causing loss of detailed mock call logs in multi-test runs.

---

### Version 1.11.0 (June 2023)

#### Functionality Issues

- Fixed failure in mocking methods returning `std::wstring` on platforms where wide strings are partially unsupported.
- Corrected `ON_CALL` to reliably override expectations during test setup phases.

#### Compatibility & Portability

- Added missing `#include` directives for C++17 compatibility across multiple compilers.

#### Thread Safety & Synchronization

- Refined mutex and notification primitives on pthread-based platforms to reduce contention under stress tests.

#### API & Flag Handling

- Fixed macro expansions to prevent conflicts with user-defined `ASSERT_*` statements in tests.

#### Testing & Diagnostics

- Improved diagnostic messages when calls mismatches occur due to argument matchers with embedded commas.

## Troubleshooting and User Tips

- If encountering unexpected mock failures, consult this page to verify if a relevant bug fix has been released.
- When upgrading between versions, pay attention to fixes in strictness mode handling (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) which affect test stability.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain detailed insights during test execution, but reset to `warning` or `error` for regular runs.
- For multi-threaded code, ensure GoogleMock synchronization primitives are fully supported on your platform; consider updates if deadlocks or crashes occur.
