# Breaking Changes

This page details all backwards-incompatible changes in the framework's API, build rules, platform support, and configuration requirements. It clarifies which areas are affected by each change and provides recommended migration strategies to help users upgrade smoothly and avoid disruptions.

## Understanding Breaking Changes

Breaking changes refer to updates that alter or remove existing functionality in a way that code written for earlier versions of the framework may no longer work or compile without modification. These changes ensure the framework evolves safely but require attention when upgrading.

GoogleTest and GoogleMock prioritize stability but occasionally introduce necessary breaking changes to improve correctness, security, or maintainability.


## Affected Areas

Breaking changes typically impact the following areas:

- **Framework API:** Modifications in public APIs such as test macros, mock classes, matchers, expectations, and assertions.

- **Build Rules:** Alterations in how the framework or its components are built or integrated with build systems like CMake or Bazel.

- **Platform Support:** Deprecation or addition of supported platforms or compilers.

- **Configuration Requirements:** Adjustments to required compiler versions, language standards (e.g., mandated C++17), or environment variables.


## Typical Reasons for Breaking Changes

- Addressing issues in test execution strategies, e.g., changes in death test behavior.
- Modernizing code to leverage newer C++ standards and features.
- Improving thread safety and concurrency guarantees.
- Refining mocking interfaces for greater expressiveness and correctness.
- Removing deprecated or insecure functionality.


## Migration Strategies

To help users navigate these changes, migration instructions accompany each breaking change. They aim to:

- Identify deprecated APIs or features and suggest alternatives.
- Provide code snippets for adapting tests or mocks.
- Highlight updated build configurations or flag usage.
- Recommend platform or compiler updates.

Proactively following these guidelines ensures continued compatibility and fully leverages the framework's improvements.


## Example Migration Workflow

1. **Review Breaking Changes:** Before upgrading, consult this page to identify relevant breaking changes for your existing tests and builds.

2. **Analyze Impact:** Determine which tests or build configurations are affected.

3. **Apply Code Updates:** Modify test code, mock definitions, or build files as per migration instructions.

4. **Run Tests and Validate:** Execute tests fully. Failures may indicate missed migration steps.

5. **Seek Support:** Consult troubleshooting documentation or community resources if issues persist.


## Best Practices to Mitigate Breakage

- **Isolate Upgrades:** Upgrade GoogleTest/GoogleMock independently from other dependencies.

- **Version Pinning:** Use precise versions and avoid jumping multiple major versions at once.

- **Incremental Changes:** Apply migration steps gradually, validating tests after each.

- **Extensive Test Coverage:** Maintain comprehensive automated test suites to catch regressions early.

- **Refactor for Stability:** Favor stable interfaces and avoid relying on internal or deprecated APIs.


## Troubleshooting Common Upgrade Issues

- **Compilation Errors:** Often caused by API signature changes or missing macro definitions.
  - Solution: Check updated API docs, adjust mocks and expectations.

- **Test Failures:** May occur due to behavior changes in mock expectations or test logic.
  - Solution: Review matchers, mock behavior modes (NiceMock/NaggyMock/StrictMock), and ordering constraints.

- **Build Failures:** Could stem from changed build flags or platform requirements.
  - Solution: Verify build integration docs for updated compiler standards and flags.


## Summary

This page is your authoritative guide to all breaking changes in the GoogleTest and GoogleMock frameworks. Careful attention to the migration guidance here will safeguard your tests and builds as you adopt new framework versions.

<Tip>
Always back up your test suite and build configurations before upgrading and applying migration steps. Test early and often to minimize upgrade disruptions.

<Warning>
Ignoring breaking change notices may lead to silent test failures or incompatible builds.

## How This Page Fits Into GoogleTest Documentation

This page complements the version history pages found under the Changelog section and the technical references for mocking and assertions. It is intended to be the go-to resource when planning an upgrade or diagnosing compatibility issues from a framework update.

## Example Breaking Change Note (Hypothetical)

### Change: Enforced Minimum C++17 Requirement

**Description:** Starting with version 1.17.0, GoogleTest requires that all projects use a compiler supporting at least C++17. Earlier versions supported C++11 with limitations.

**Impact:** Tests or build systems targeting older standards no longer compile.

**Migration:** Update your build to include the compiler flag to enable C++17 or higher (e.g., `-std=c++17`). Adjust any deprecated C++ features accordingly.

See [System Requirements](../../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.md) for details.
