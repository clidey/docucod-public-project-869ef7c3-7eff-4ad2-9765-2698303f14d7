# Deprecation Notices

This page provides an ongoing catalog of deprecated APIs, features, and practices within the GoogleTest framework. It is intended to help users identify outdated usage patterns and transition smoothly to supported alternatives. Maintaining awareness of these deprecations is crucial for writing future-proof and maintainable test code.

---

## Overview of Deprecations

GoogleTest evolves continually to improve usability, performance, and correctness. Some older APIs and practices become deprecated as better alternatives emerge or foundational changes (such as enforcing C++17) take effect. This page tracks such deprecations, offers transition guidance, and indicates official support sunset timelines.

This resource focuses exclusively on deprecated elements **specific to GoogleTest's** mocking, assertions, and test framework features — not external dependencies or tooling.


## Commonly Deprecated Elements

While you should always verify against the latest GoogleTest release notes and migration guides, here are some key deprecated components and their recommended replacements:

### 1. Legacy Mock Method Macros

- **Deprecated:** `MOCK_METHODn`, `MOCK_CONST_METHODn`, and their variants with `_T` and `WITH_CALLTYPE`
- **Use Instead:** Unified templated `MOCK_METHOD` macro, providing a clearer, more consistent syntax for mocking methods including support for qualifiers and reference qualifiers.

**Example Migration:**

```cpp
// Old style
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));
MOCK_CONST_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// New style
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int), ());
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int), (const));
```

### 2. Use of `NULL` in Assertions

- **Deprecated:** Using `NULL` in `EXPECT_EQ(NULL, ptr)` or `ASSERT_EQ(NULL, ptr)` is discouraged.
- **Use Instead:** Use `nullptr`, e.g., `EXPECT_EQ(nullptr, ptr)` for clarity and correctness with modern C++.

### 3. Unqualified Test and Fixture Names with Underscores

GoogleTest discourages underscores in test suite and test case names due to possible conflicts and reserved naming rules.
- Avoid underscores to prevent surprising compilation or runtime issues. See [FAQ on naming conventions](../faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore).


### 4. Deprecated Macros and Flags

- Deprecated internal macros or compile-time flags may be removed or replaced over releases.
- Refer to the official breaking changes and upgrade notes for detailed transition information.


## Migration Guidance

GoogleTest provides migration guides to assist in adapting your test code:

- **Unified MOCK_METHOD Migration:** Transition from `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the single `MOCK_METHOD` macro with explicit argument lists and qualifiers.
- **C++17 Enforcement:** Ensure your codebase compiles with at least C++17 as legacy C++14 or earlier support is dropped.
- **Expectations Syntax Changes:** Adapt to any new semantic changes in expectation matching and verification, especially around overloaded and reference-qualified methods.

See the Breaking Changes & Migration Notes in the [Breaking Changes & Upgrade Guides](../breaking-changes-upgrade-guides/breaking-changes.mdx) for comprehensive steps.


## Timeline and Support Policy

- Deprecated features are retained for at least one major release cycle before removal.
- Users are encouraged to update to recommended alternatives promptly to avoid issues in future updates.


## Tips and Best Practices

- Favor the modern `MOCK_METHOD` macro and use qualifiers `(const, override, noexcept, ref(&), etc.)` explicitly.
- Prefer `nullptr` over `NULL` to avoid ambiguities.
- Use GoogleTest’s rich matcher and assertion APIs (`EXPECT_THAT`, `MATCHER`, `ASSERT_DEATH`, etc.) for expressive and robust tests.
- Regularly consult GoogleTest release notes to identify upcoming deprecations early.


## Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues

If you encounter warnings or errors related to deprecated interfaces:

- Review the compiler warnings and emitted message for suggested replacements.
- Examine usage of old mock macros or assertion patterns.
- Consult the [Changelog - Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](../breaking-changes-upgrade-guides/breaking-changes.mdx).
- Upgrade your compiler and build environment to align with the current requirements (C++17 minimum).
