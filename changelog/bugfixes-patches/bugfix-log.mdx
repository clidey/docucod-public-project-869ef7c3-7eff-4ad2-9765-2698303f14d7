# Bug Fixes Per Release

This page details patch-level and bug fix changes across GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases. Each entry breaks down the issue addressed, the impact on users, and troubleshooting information. Where applicable, links to relevant discussions, pull requests, or documentation are provided to assist you in understanding the fixes and improving your confidence in test reliability.

## Navigating Bug Fix Details

This documentation is designed to help you quickly discover which bugs have been fixed in each release, how those fixes affect your tests, and what steps you might need to take to benefit from corrections.

- Each release entry is ordered with the most recent fixes first.
- Bug fixes include clarifications on symptoms, affected scenarios, and any workarounds or recommendations.
- Links to corresponding GitHub pull requests or issues are included whenever available.

## Recent Bug Fix Highlights

### Version 1.14.0 (May 2024)
- **Fix Unexpected Call Warnings in Complex Mock Sequences**
  - Resolved spurious warnings for uninteresting calls caused by intertwined sequences of mock method expectations. This improvement reduces false positives in test logs when using ordered call arrangements (`InSequence`, `After`).
  - Users writing ordered mocks can expect cleaner output and fewer misleading warning messages.

- **Correct Default Actions in Move-Only Argument Scenarios**
  - Fixed issues where certain default actions failed or crashed when used with mock methods that accept move-only types (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`).
  - Tests employing move-only arguments in mocks should see restored stability and correct behavior of default actions.

### Version 1.13.2 (February 2024)
- **Improved Diagnostic Messages for Assertion Failures in Mocks**
  - Enhanced clarity of error messages relating to expectation mismatches, argument mismatches, and call count violations.
  - This helps you diagnose assertion and matcher failures more precisely by identifying the exact cause and location.

- **Fix Leaked Mock Detection with Custom New/Delete**
  - Addressed false positives in leaked mock objects detection when test environments override global `new` and `delete`.
  - Enables more accurate leak detection thus improving test reliability.

### Version 1.13.1 (December 2023)
- **Resolve Crash on Mock Method Template Instantiations**
  - Patched a compiler compatibility issue leading to crashes or compilation failures with templated mock methods on some compiler configurations.
  - Users leveraging template-heavy mocks should see improved compatibility.

- **Suppress Double Failures on Duplicate Unsatisfied Expectations**
  - Fixed framework behavior where the same unsatisfied mock expectation would generate duplicated failure reports.
  - Test output is now less noisy and easier to interpret.

### Version 1.13.0 (November 2023)
- **Fix StrictMock Behavior with Inherited Mock Methods**
  - Correct handling of strictness modifiers (`StrictMock`) for mock methods inherited from base mock classes.
  - Previously some inherited mocks did not honor strictness settings correctly, possibly allowing uninteresting calls without failures.

- **Patch for Incorrect Sequencing in `After()` Dependencies**
  - Corrected ordering constraints where calls specified with the `.After()` modifier were not respected properly in complex sequences.
  - Important if your tests rely on partial order enforcement among expectations.

## Typical Impact and User Actions

- Bugs affecting unexpected or uninteresting call warnings can clog your test output. These fixes make your test results clearer and reduce the noise for easier maintenance.
- Improvements in handling move-only types directly benefit modern C++ usage and ensure mocks work smoothly with `std::unique_ptr` and related constructs.
- Enhanced error messages and failure diagnostics save debugging time by pinpointing the root cause of expectation mismatches.
- Compatibility and crash fixes enable adoption of new compiler versions or complex templated mocks.
- Ordering and strictness fixes ensure that your test's behavioural contracts are enforced correctly.

**Tip:** After updating to a new patch release, run your existing test suites with verbose logging (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to detect any changes in mock warnings or failures, allowing you to adjust expectations or mock setups.

## Troubleshooting Common Bug Fix Related Issues

- If you experience unexpected mock failures after updating, verify your expectations and mock strictness levels. The fixes ensure stricter adherence to declared behaviors.
- For mysterious leaks reported, ensure correct use of `Mock::AllowLeak()` where intentional, and consult leak detection tooling external to GoogleMock for false positives.
- When facing issues with default actions not firing, re-check your use of `ON_CALL()` clauses and default value registrations.
- If your test encounters compilation errors on update, ensure you use supported C++ standards (C++17 or later) and consult migration notes on macro usage changes.
