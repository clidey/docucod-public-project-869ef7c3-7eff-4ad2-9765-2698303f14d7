# Maintenance & Support Policy

Effective long-term maintenance and compatibility are critical to ensuring that GoogleTest continues to serve the needs of diverse C++ development environments. This policy outlines the general approach adopted by the GoogleTest team to the maintenance, support cycles, and backward compatibility of the framework. It empowers organizations and developers to plan their adoption and upgrades with confidence, minimizing disruption as the framework evolves.

---

## 1. Support Strategy Overview

GoogleTest commits to providing a stable and reliable testing framework suitable for both open-source and enterprise use. To achieve this, the maintenance strategy features:

- **Semantic Versioning**: Releases adhere to a versioning scheme that signals the nature of changes (major, minor, patch) to users.
- **API Stability**: Public APIs maintain backward compatibility within major versions.
- **Regular Updates**: Patches and minor releases address bugs, security, and performance improvements without breaking existing tests.
- **Deprecation Policy**: Deprecated functionality is phased out over time with ample warning and documented migration paths.

This policy ensures a balance between evolving the framework and maintaining a dependable experience for users.

## 2. Support Cycles and Release Policy

### 2.1 Release Types

GoogleTest releases come in three primary flavors:

- **Major Releases**: Introduce new features and potentially backward-incompatible changes. Users are advised to carefully read migration notes.
- **Minor Releases**: Add backward-compatible functionality and improvements.
- **Patch Releases**: Include bug fixes and security updates only; no API or behavior changes expected.

### 2.2 Release Frequency

- Minor and patch releases are made regularly based on reported bugs, security advisories, and user feedback.
- Major releases are less frequent and are announced well in advance.

### 2.3 Support for Versions

- Each major release receives ongoing patch updates until the next major release.
- Legacy major versions receive only critical security and bug fixes.

## 3. Compatibility and Migration

### 3.1 Backward Compatibility

Within a major version series, API stability is maintained. This means tests and mocks developed against any minor or patch version will work unchanged with later versions in the same major line.

### 3.2 Breaking Changes

- Major releases may introduce breaking changes.
- Breaking changes are clearly documented with detailed migration guides.
- The team provides guidance on modifying test code to adapt to new APIs or behaviors.

### 3.3 Deprecations

- Deprecated features remain functional for at least one major release.
- Usage of deprecated features generates compiler warnings or documentation notices.
- Migration timelines are communicated to users ahead of removals.

### 3.4 Testing and Validation

- Extensive test suites are maintained to verify compatibility.
- The GoogleTest community is encouraged to participate in beta testing releases.

## 4. Issue Tracking and Patch Management

- Bugs and security vulnerabilities are prioritized and addressed promptly.
- The issue tracker is public and transparent, enabling users to monitor fixes.
- Patch releases focus on widely impactful issues with minimal risk.

## 5. Community and Contribution

- Maintainers encourage community reporting of issues and contributions of patches.
- Changes undergo rigorous review to avoid regression.
- Communication channels provide early visibility on upcoming changes.

## 6. Recommendations for Users

- Track GoogleTest releases regularly, reading release notes carefully.
- Pin dependencies to major versions if strict API stability is necessary.
- Use migration guides when upgrading major versions.
- Contribute feedback and tests to assist ongoing quality.
