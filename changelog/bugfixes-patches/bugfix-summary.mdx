# Bug Fix and Patch History

This page presents a chronological summary of bug fixes, patches, and incremental updates applied to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It highlights the specific issues addressed in each version, providing crucial context for users aiming to: 

- Diagnose regressions introduced in past releases
- Verify the resolution status of reported bugs
- Understand minor stability or compatibility improvements

The history is structured in reverse chronological order, ensuring immediate access to the latest changes.

## Recent Fixes and Patches

### Version Updates

- Each entry corresponds to a specific released version.
- Detailed descriptions emphasize user-facing impact, such as:
  - Fixes for unexpected behaviors observed during mocking and testing
  - Corrections for assertion macros or matchers not functioning as expected
  - Improvements in diagnostic messages and test output clarity
- Notes related to compatibility or follow-up issues where applicable.

### Important Aspects Covered

- Fixes related to mocking method behaviors, including handling of overloaded functions and const methods
- Corrections addressing issues when default or explicit actions within expectations behave improperly or generate misleading messages
- Updates improving the handling of uninteresting and unexpected calls on mocks
- Adjustments to ensure consistent evaluation of expressions and parameters during expectation setup
- Patches to support move-only types in mocked methods, and related action handling
- Enhancements to sequencing and ordering of expected calls, including edge cases involving partial orders or retired expectations
- Adjustments to verbose output levels and diagnostic verbosity flags
- Resolutions for compilation or runtime issues on specific platforms or compiler configurations

## Legacy and Edge Case Fixes

Apart from routine maintenance, some patches address:

- Subtle cases where default or repeated expectations improperly suppressed warnings or silently failed
- Compiler-specific tweaks to ensure compatibility
- Refinements to internal synchronization mechanisms in multi-threaded test scenarios
- Enhancements that prevent infinite recursion or deadlock when mock methods call each other

These fixes enhance the robustness and correctness of test suites relying on GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

## How to Use This History

- **Triage Regressions:** Identify if a problematic behavior was introduced or resolved in a given version.
- **Patch Awareness:** Confirm inclusion of particular fixes in the GoogleTest version used.
- **Compatibility Validation:** Determine if update to a newer version addresses integration or environment issues.
