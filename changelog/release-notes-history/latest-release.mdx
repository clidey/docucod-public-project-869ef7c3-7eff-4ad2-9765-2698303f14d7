# Latest Release Overview

This page summarizes the most recent release of GoogleTest, highlighting key features, bug fixes, and deprecations. It serves as a quick reference to help users understand the updates and their benefits, facilitating smooth adoption of the latest version.

---

## 1. Release Summary

**Version:** 1.17.0  
**Release Date:** [Refer to the official GitHub release](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0)  

This release marks an important milestone by aligning with modern C++ standards and enhancing integration capabilities for users.

### Key Highlights

- **C++17 Minimum Standard Requirement:** This release requires C++17 or above, ensuring improved language features, safety, and compile-time guarantees.
- **Documentation Migration:** Documentation is now hosted and maintained on GitHub Pages at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/), providing safer, more accessible navigation.
- **Build System Updates:** Enhanced CMake and Bazel integration that streamlines configuration and project setup, supporting the latest platform compatibilities.
- **Mocking and Testing Enhancements:** GoogleMock continues to integrate tightly with GoogleTest, providing seamless mocking capabilities with clear syntax and improved usability.

## 2. What’s New for Users?

### Modern C++ Adoption
To leverage the latest language features and keep pace with standard evolution, the 1.17.0 release requires an environment with C++17 support. Users should verify their compiler and build environment settings accordingly, as detailed in the [Prerequisites and Supported Platforms](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/setup-overview/prerequisites.html).

### Easier Project Setup
Improved CMake support offers two main user-friendly routes:

- **Standalone Build:** Easily build and test GoogleTest and GoogleMock as standalone projects.
- **Embedded Usage:** Incorporate GoogleTest into an existing CMake project via `add_subdirectory()` or `FetchContent`, ensuring consistent compiler flags and linkage.

Consult [Configuring Your Project](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/first-steps/configure-project.html) for detailed instructions.

### Robust Mocking Support
GoogleMock's declarative syntax for mocks and advanced mocking features are fully included, as GoogleTest and GoogleMock are maintained together. Users can define mock classes, set expectations, and control mock strictness with confidence, following usage patterns documented in [Mocking Dependencies with GoogleMock](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/core-testing-workflows/using-mocks-in-tests.html).

---

## 3. Important Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Enhanced platform detection and compatibility checks provide smoother builds across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Improved thread safety and synchronization primitives accommodate multithreaded test environments robustly.
- Macro renaming options to avoid conflicts with other libraries ensure smoother integration with diverse codebases.
- Refinements in the framework's internal utilities for logging, parsing command line flags, and environment variable handling increase stability and user feedback quality.

---

## 4. Deprecations and Breaking Changes

### Breaking Change: Minimum C++ Standard
Users must now compile test code and GoogleTest itself using at least a C++17-compliant compiler and flags. Failing to meet this requirement will result in build errors stating unsupported language version.

### Deprecated Macros & Flags
Certain older macros for controlling runtime behavior are deprecated in favor of modern equivalents and should be replaced. Refer to the [Upgrade Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/changelog/upgrade-support/upgrade-guide.html) for detailed migration steps.

---

## 5. Upgrading to 1.17.0

### Step 1: Verify Compiler Compatibility
Ensure your compiler supports C++17 fully. GCC 7+, Clang 5+, and MSVC 2017 Update 3+ are recommended.

### Step 2: Update Build Configurations
Adjust your CMake, Bazel, or other build system scripts to use C++17 standard flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` or `/std:c++17`). If using GoogleTest as a submodule or FetchContent, follow the updated project inclusion examples in the [Configuring Your Project](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/first-steps/configure-project.html).

### Step 3: Review Dependencies
If you rely on GoogleMock, ensure you link to either `gmock` or `gmock_main` targets consistently. Review linking flags and dependencies especially if you dynamically link runtimes on Windows with Visual Studio.

### Step 4: Address API Deprecations
Replace deprecated macros and flags with their modern counterparts as per the official upgrade notes. Run your tests with verbose output enabled to detect any warnings.

## 7. Example: Building GoogleTest Standalone with CMake (1.17.0)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

*Tip:* If you prefer to build only GoogleTest without GoogleMock, use:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```
