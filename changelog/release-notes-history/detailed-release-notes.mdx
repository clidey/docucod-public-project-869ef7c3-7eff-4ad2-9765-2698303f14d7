## Important Notes on Breaking Changes

- Major releases introduce C++ version requirements that may require users to update compiler settings.
- Updated macro usage rules, particularly for `MOCK_METHOD`, which must always be declared in the `public:` section.
- Behavior of call expectations modified to better handle saturation and expectation retirement.

If your code relies on previous behaviors, consult the migration guides accompanying each breaking change for step-by-step adjustments.
