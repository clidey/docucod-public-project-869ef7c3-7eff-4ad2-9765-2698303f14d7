# Recent Releases Overview

This page provides a high-level summary of the most recent GoogleTest and GoogleMock releases, highlighting important features, platform support changes, and significant improvements to help you decide whether to upgrade.

## Understanding the Latest GoogleTest Releases

GoogleTest continues to evolve as a robust, modern C++ testing framework. The most recent releases focus on enhancing test stability, improving abstractions for writing expressive tests, and refining platform compatibility aligned with contemporary C++ standards.

### Key Highlights

- **C++17 Minimum Requirement**: The latest releases require at least a C++17-compliant compiler, ensuring usage of modern language features and better performance. This update impacts all supported platforms starting from the 1.17.x release branch.

- **Merged GoogleTest and GoogleMock**: The projects are now a consolidated repository, simplifying dependency management and improving integration between testing and mocking frameworks.

- **Enhanced Assertion Granularity**: The set of assertions has been expanded and refined to give developers more precise control over test conditions and clearer failure diagnostics.

- **Test Discovery and Execution Improvements**: Automated test discovery has been strengthened, enabling more seamless integration with build systems and IDEs.

- **Support for Parallel and Sharded Test Runs**: New options facilitate speeding up large test suites by running tests in parallel or distributed shards.


## User Impact and Upgrade Guidance

If you are currently using an older version of GoogleTest or GoogleMock, upgrading to the latest releases will provide:

- Access to modern C++ features, improving test expressiveness and maintainability.
- Compatibility with the latest build tools and platforms under active support.
- A unified testing and mocking experience, reducing complexity in test infrastructure.
- Better performance and reliability in test execution pipelines.

<Callout title="Tip">
Ensure your project’s build environment supports at least C++17 before upgrading to the 1.17.x branch or later versions.

## Supported Platforms and Toolchains

GoogleTest follows Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to define and maintain a list of officially supported platforms, compilers, and build tools. This ensures that tests you write are portable and consistent across environments.

Check the comprehensive support matrix here for up-to-date compatibility details: [Supported Platforms Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).


## Notable Integrations and Ecosystem Tools

GoogleTest works harmoniously with common C++ build systems like CMake and Bazel, and integrates smoothly into CI pipelines and IDE workflows. Its ecosystem includes community and official tools:

- **GTest Runner**: GUI-based test runner for Windows and Linux.
- **GoogleTest Adapter and C++ TestMate**: VS Code extensions for running and debugging tests.
- **gtest-parallel**: A tool to run tests in parallel for faster execution.

These integrations improve developer experience and the manageability of test suites in real-world projects. See the [Integration Entry Points](../overview/architecture-features/integration-entrypoints) documentation for detailed guidance.

## Troubleshooting and Common Upgrade Considerations

- If tests fail to compile upon upgrading, verify your compiler supports C++17 and that your build files reflect this minimum standard.
- For flaky or non-discoverable tests, review new test discovery behaviors, especially if your test registration is manual or customized.
- Check for deprecated or changed APIs by reviewing the [Breaking Changes](../changelog/breaking-changes-migration/breaking-changes) documentation to ensure smooth migration.
