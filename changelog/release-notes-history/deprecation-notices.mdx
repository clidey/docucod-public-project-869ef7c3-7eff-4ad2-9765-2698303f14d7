# Deprecations & Removal Timeline

Understanding the history and future of deprecated features, APIs, and their phased removals is vital for developers maintaining or integrating with GoogleTest. This page provides a clear, authoritative record of features marked deprecated, scheduled removals, and guidance to help you plan your upgrades and code adaptations with confidence.

---

## Why This Timeline Matters

Imagine you maintain a large project using GoogleTest for automated testing. Suddenly, a new GoogleTest version warns you that certain APIs you rely on will be removed soon. Without a clear timeline, you risk disruption in your testing workflow or integration with your external tools.

This page equips you to anticipate such changes. By consulting the deprecations timeline, you know which features are safe to continue using temporarily, when you must refactor, and how to avoid surprises during upgrades.

---

## How to Read This Timeline

The timeline is organized in reverse chronological order, showing deprecated features from most recent to older ones, along with their planned removal versions. For each deprecated item, you will find:

- **Feature/API Name**: The specific item deprecated.
- **Version Introduced**: When the deprecation was announced.
- **Scheduled Removal Version**: The targeted version when this item will no longer be supported.
- **Impact**: What this means for your usage and integration.
- **Migration Advice**: Steps and best practices to adapt or replace the deprecated item.

This structure ensures you can quickly scan for the features relevant to your usage and understand the urgency and migration path.

---

## Typical User Workflow

1. **Review Deprecations Regularly**: Before starting an upgrade, check this timeline to identify any risky deprecated features your project may use.

2. **Analyze Usage Impact**: For each deprecated feature, verify if your code calls or integrates with it.

3. **Plan Migration Paths**: Use the provided migration advice to prepare code changes, such as replacing deprecated mocks, macros, or utility functions.

4. **Test Against Latest Release Candidates**: Validate your changes with pre-release versions where deprecated features may still be present but generate warnings.

5. **Perform Upgrades**: Once deprecated features are finally removed, your code should no longer rely on them.

6. **Verify Test Stability**: Confirm that your tests run smoothly with the latest GoogleTest version without hitting removed APIs.

## Examples of Deprecated Features

- **Legacy MOCK_METHODn Macros**
  - *Deprecated Since*: v1.11.0
  - *Removal Scheduled For*: v1.20.0
  - *Details*: The old family of macros (`MOCK_METHODn`, `MOCK_CONST_METHODn`) has been superseded by the more versatile `MOCK_METHOD`. Using legacy macros triggers deprecation warnings.
  - *Migration*: Replace legacy macros with `MOCK_METHOD` syntax as documented in the [MOCK_METHOD Macro Reference](../api-reference/core-mocking-apis/mock-methods).

- **NaggyMock Wrapper**
  - *Deprecated Since*: v1.14.0
  - *Removal Scheduled For*: v1.22.0
  - *Details*: NaggyMock emits warnings on uninteresting calls; current best practice favors `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` wrappers.
  - *Migration*: Transition existing `NaggyMock` usage to `NiceMock` for better control and fewer warnings.

- **Deprecated Assertion Macros**
  - *Deprecated Since*: varies by macro
  - *Removal Schedule*: Scheduled individually; some legacy macros may be fully replaced with enhanced matcher-based assertions.
  - *Advice*: Favor the use of `EXPECT_THAT`, `ASSERT_THAT` with expressive matchers for cleaner assertions.

## Managing API Removals

When a deprecated feature is removed, the following user impacts occur:

1. **Compilation Errors**: Code using the removed feature will fail to compile.
2. **Linker Errors**: If an obsolete API is unavailable in libraries.
3. **Runtime Behavior Changes**: Tests might fail due to missing functionality.

**To mitigate:**

- Keep abreast of deprecation notices in release notes.
- Start migrating away from deprecated APIs immediately upon deprecation.
- Run your test suite against nightly builds or release candidates early.
- Consult migration guides and example adaptations.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Unintended Use of Deprecated APIs**
  - *Symptom*: Warnings during build; future breakage upon upgrade.
  - *Solution*: Search your codebase for usages of deprecated macros and methods. Utilize compiler warning flags and automated tools.

- **Ambiguous Deprecation Messages**
  - *Symptom*: Warnings without clear migration path.
  - *Solution*: Refer to the linked documentation sections or support channels.

- **Compatibility with Third-Party Tools**
  - *Symptom*: External testing tools or CI integrations fail after an upgrade.
  - *Solution*: Ensure third-party tooling updates have caught up with the GoogleTest changes.

## Staying Informed

- Review the [Detailed Release Notes](./detailed-release-notes) regularly for up-to-date information on deprecations and removals.
- Subscribe to official mailing lists or GitHub notifications for GoogleTest updates.
- Follow best practices in upgrading test frameworks, breaking down changes into manageable portions.
