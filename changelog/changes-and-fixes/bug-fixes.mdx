# Bug Fixes & Patch Notes

This page provides detailed lists of issues resolved between releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It includes critical bug fixes, security patches, and regressions addressed to ensure test stability and correctness. Each entry directly maps to specific source modules, enabling users to understand which parts of the codebase were impacted.

---

## Purpose and Scope

Users rely on this page to stay informed about changes that could affect their testing environment, especially those impacting test outcomes or framework behavior. By reviewing these fixes, users can anticipate necessary updates or confirm fixes have addressed previous problems.

Unlike feature highlights or broader release notes, this page focuses explicitly on the resolution of bugs — both subtle and critical — that have been discovered post-release. Its content is indispensable for maintaining test reliability in continuously evolving projects.

---

## Content Organization

The changelog is organized in reverse chronological order, listing bug fixes from the most recent releases first. Each release entry comprehensively details:

- **Version and Date**: Clearly marks the release version and publication date.
- **Issue Categories**: Separates fixes into types such as critical bug fixes, security patches, regression corrections, and miscellaneous repairs.
- **Impact & Description**: Provides actionable descriptions of each fix from the user’s perspective, emphasizing the problem solved and potential effects on test behavior or framework stability.
- **Source Mapping**: When applicable, points to source modules or files that were modified, helping advanced users and integrators trace changes.

---

## How This Page Fits in the Documentation

Within the GoogleTest and GoogleMock ecosystem, this page complements:

- The **Version History** documenting release milestones chronologically,
- **Security Updates** informing on vulnerabilities and protective measures,
- The **Migration and Breaking Changes** guides,

by narrowing focus specifically to maintenance and corrections important for test correctness and framework robustness.

---

## User Guidance and Best Practices

**Keeping Up-to-Date:** Users are strongly encouraged to review this page regularly before upgrading to a new version to review resolved issues.

**Identify Regressions:** When encountering test failures suspected to be caused by the framework itself rather than user code, consult this changelog to check if the issue has been addressed.

**Testing After Fixes:** After applying updates from these patch releases, rerun your test suites thoroughly to confirm that expected gains from fixes are realized.

**Security Awareness:** Pay special attention to security patches that might impact test isolation or data safety.

## Example Fix Entry

**Version 1.17.0 (Released 2024-05-10)**

- *Critical Fix:* Corrected a memory leak in mock object verification that caused intermittent test suite crashes when using `StrictMock`.
- *Regression Fix:* Resolved a flaky behavior where `EXPECT_CALL` with repeated matchers incorrectly reported unsatisfied expectations.
- *Security Patch:* Hardened internal logging to prevent null-pointer dereferences from corrupted test code inputs.
- *Modules Affected:* mocking-basics, actions, internal_utils.cmake
