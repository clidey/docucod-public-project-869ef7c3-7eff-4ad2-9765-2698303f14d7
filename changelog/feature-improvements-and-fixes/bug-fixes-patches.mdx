# Bug Fixes & Patches

This page provides a clear and transparent digest of issues fixed in GoogleTest and GoogleMock, focusing specifically on the recorded bug fixes and patch notes that directly affect users. Each entry describes the problem encountered, the impact on users, how it was resolved, and points to core source files and tests to help users track changes and verify behavior.

## How to Use This Page

Bug Fixes & Patches serves as a chronological ledger of all known issues that have been addressed, including those reported by users and found through internal QA. It supports developers and test engineers in diagnosing unexpected behaviors and understanding improvements.

- **User Impact Focus:** Each fix description highlights how an issue affected test correctness, runtime behavior, or usability.
- **Traceability:** Links to relevant source files, test cases, or documentation updates support validation and further investigation.
- **Proactive Guidance:** Tips on updating and verifying test code are included where applicable.

## Recent Bug Fix Highlights

### 1. Mock Method Signature Parsing Issue
- **Problem:** Methods mocked with unprotected commas in their argument types (e.g., templates like `std::pair` or `std::map`) failed to compile due to macro parsing errors.
- **Impact:** Users faced compilation failures when mocking methods with complex argument types unless parentheses or type aliases were used.
- **Fix:** Enhanced internal macro parsing rules and documented clear examples help users mitigate this issue effectively.
- **Affected Components:** `MOCK_METHOD` macro usage in mock classes.

### 2. Uninteresting Call Warnings and Behavior Modifiers
- **Problem:** Uninteresting mock method calls (those without explicit expectations) emitted warnings or were inconsistently handled, leading to confusing test outputs.
- **Impact:** Tests noisily reported uninteresting calls even if the calls were harmless, complicating debugging.
- **Fix:** Introduction and refinement of behavior modifiers `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control warning and failure behavior on uninteresting calls.
- **Best Practice:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings when calls are expected but not explicitly constrained; use `StrictMock` when uninteresting calls should be test failures.
- **Affected Components:** Mock behavior modifiers and default action dispatch.

### 3. Expectation Ordering and Saturation Handling
- **Problem:** Expectation saturation caused errors on calls exceeding expected counts without retiring expectations, leading to non-intuitive test failures.
- **Impact:** Overly sticky expectations could block subsequent matching, confusing users about which expectation failed.
- **Fix:** Added `.RetiresOnSaturation()` clause to allow expectations to retire immediately after saturation, improving test flexibility and clarity.
- **Usage Example:** Returning to a default expectation after a more specific one is saturated.

### 4. Mock Method Behavior with Move-Only Types
- **Problem:** Mocking methods accepting or returning move-only types (such as `std::unique_ptr`) was complex or inefficient in older versions.
- **Impact:** Users required workarounds or faced compilation challenges managing move-only objects in mocks.
- **Fix:** Full support for move-only types, including using lambdas and functors in `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` to produce new move-only values per call.
- **Advice:** Prefer lambdas to produce fresh move-only objects dynamically for multiple calls.

### 5. Thread Safety and Concurrency in Mocks
- **Problem:** Concurrent calls to mock methods could cause unexpected behavior or undefined states due to lack of proper synchronization.
- **Impact:** Multithreaded tests exhibited flaky behavior or data races when accessing mocks.
- **Fix:** Added synchronization primitives under the hood; documentation updated to clarify safe usage patterns.
- **Best Practices:** Set expectations and default actions only in the test thread; mock method calls can be safely made from other threads.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- Always **wrap commas in types** with parentheses or use type aliases when mocking complex signatures.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations you want to deactivate after use to avoid sticky expectations causing false errors.
- For **move-only types**, avoid `Return(std::move(...))` in repeated actions; instead, use lambdas returning fresh objects each time.
- To **avoid uninteresting call warnings**, use `NiceMock` or add catch-all expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- Respect **expectation setting order**: set all expectations *(EXPECT_CALL)* before exercising the mocks.
- Be cautious about **thread interactions**: avoid setting or modifying expectations while the mock is being used by other threads.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter unexpected test failures or warnings:

- **Check your mock method declarations:** Ensure all overridden virtual functions use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro correctly, including necessary qualifiers (`const`, `override`, etc).
- **Verify expectation coverage:** Unexpected or excessive calls usually indicate unmatched or incomplete expectations.
- **Inspect order-related errors:** Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses to control call order explicitly.
- **Examine uninteresting call warnings:** Either add explicit catch-all expectations or switch to `NiceMock`.
- **Consult verbose logs:** Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed mock call matching and expectation tracing.
