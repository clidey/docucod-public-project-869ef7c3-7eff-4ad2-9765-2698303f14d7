# Deprecation Notices

The **Deprecation Notices** page serves as a comprehensive catalog of all deprecated features and APIs within GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This resource is essential for development teams aiming to proactively plan adaptation strategies by understanding what capabilities are being phased out, their removal timelines, and recommended alternatives. Keeping abreast of these notices ensures your code remains compatible with future releases and leverages the most up-to-date and supported APIs.

---

### Understanding Deprecations

When features or APIs are deprecated, it means they are no longer recommended for use and are slated for eventual removal. This page provides authoritative information users need to:

- **Identify Deprecated Elements:** Clearly see which functions, macros, or constructs are deprecated.
- **Removal Timelines:** Understand when deprecated features will be removed from the codebase.
- **Migration Recommendations:** Discover the advised alternatives or replacement APIs.
- **Adaptation Strategies:** Plan code changes ahead of time to minimize future disruptions.

---

### Why this Page Matters

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are evolving libraries designed to improve test robustness, performance, and correctness. As newer, better APIs are introduced, older ones are phased out to streamline the interface and reduce maintenance overhead. This page helps you:

- Stay informed about API changes that affect test and mocking code.
- Avoid using deprecated features in new code.
- Ensure continued compatibility and take advantage of enhancements.

### Deprecated Features Catalog

This section lists all known deprecated features and APIs, specifying crucial information for each.

#### Example: MOCK_METHODn Macros

- **Deprecated:** The older family of macros such as `MOCK_METHOD0`, `MOCK_CONST_METHOD1`, etc.
- **Removal Timeline:** Deprecated since 2018 with migration encouraged.
- **Recommended Alternative:** Use the generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- **Migration Notes:** 
  - Wrap argument types containing commas in parentheses.
  - Use the newer syntax: `MOCK_METHOD(return_type, method_name, (args...), (specifiers));`
  - This reduces complexity and improves code clarity.

#### Deprecated Flag API Usage

- **Deprecated:** Global-style flags or older flag declaration methods.
- **Replacement:** Use the modern flag system integrated with Abseil flags.

#### Deprecated Initialization Methods

- **Deprecated:** Multiple separate initialization calls for GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- **Replacement:** Use consolidated `InitGoogleMock()` to initialize both libraries simultaneously.

### Timelines for Removal

GoogleTest follows a deprecation policy that allows ample time before removing features. Typically, deprecations are announced in the changelog and remain supported for several release cycles to allow migration. Please monitor release notes and changelogs for precise removal versions.

---

### Recommended Alternatives and Migration Paths

For each deprecated feature, this page guides you towards supported alternatives, e.g., moving from old to new mocking macros, adopting new matcher or action APIs. In most cases:

- Replace `MOCK_METHODn` with `MOCK_METHOD` using the updated syntax.
- Update expectations and behaviors according to the latest `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` conventions as detailed in the Mocking Reference.
- Transition from old environment variable flags to the modern flag system, ensuring compatibility with `InitGoogleMock()`.

---

### Practical Tips for Users

- Regularly consult this page before upgrading GoogleTest or GoogleMock versions.
- Refactor existing test code incrementally to replace deprecated usages.
- Run your test suite under newer versions to catch deprecation warnings early.
- Use migration guides in the Upgrade and Migration documentation for detailed step-by-step instructions.

---

### Troubleshooting Deprecated Features

If you encounter build errors or warnings related to deprecated features:

- Review the specific deprecated notice on this page.
- Identify the alternative API or pattern recommended.
- Apply migration steps to remove or replace the deprecated usage.
- Consult the upgrade guides and changelogs for known issues and their fixes.

---

### Stay Updated

Subscribe to official release announcements and review changelog pages regularly to keep your test infrastructure up-to-date and secure. This proactive approach prevents unexpected breakages and leverages ongoing improvements in the GoogleTest ecosystem.

### Related Documentation

- **Mock Method Macros:** Details on modern mock method declarations, including `MOCK_METHOD` syntax and qualifiers.
- **Mocking Reference:** In-depth discussions on expectations, call behaviors, and mock strictness.
- **Initialization and Main:** Updated method `InitGoogleMock()` for initializing testing frameworks.
- **Upgrade and Migration Guides:** Stepwise procedures to adapt test code for new GoogleTest releases.
- **Changelog - Breaking Changes Overview:** Overview of significant breaking changes affecting mock APIs.

### Callouts

<Note>
Always prefer the modern `MOCK_METHOD` over old-style mock macros to future-proof your tests.
</Note>

<Tip>
Use `InitGoogleMock()` to initialize both GoogleTest and GoogleMock in one step, as older separate initializers are deprecated.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not ignore deprecation warnings; they indicate upcoming removals that will break your tests if unaddressed.
</Warning>

### Example Migration

```cpp
// Deprecated usage
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD0(DoSomething, void());  // Deprecated
};

// Recommended usage
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (), (override));
};
```
