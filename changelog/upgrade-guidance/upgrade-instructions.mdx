# Upgrade Instructions & Best Practices

This guide provides clear, actionable steps to help you upgrade your projects using GoogleTest and GoogleMock to the latest versions. Whether you are adopting new features, handling breaking changes, or ensuring compatibility with updated standards such as C++17, this document walks you through best practices, common pitfalls, and verification methods to safeguard a smooth transition.

---

## 1. Preparing for the Upgrade

### 1.1 Assess Your Current Setup

- **Identify Current Version**: Check the version of GoogleTest/GoogleMock in use via your build scripts or package manager.
- **Review Release Notes**: Familiarize yourself with the [Release History](./all-releases.md) and especially the [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](./breaking-changes.md).
- **Verify C++ Standard**: The 1.17.x release of GoogleTest requires at least C++17 support. Ensure your compiler and build configuration comply with this minimum.

### 1.2 Establish a Backup and Testing Baseline

- Retain a stable branch or backup of your current project state before upgrading.
- Run your full suite of tests with the current GoogleTest version to establish a baseline for comparison post-upgrade.

### 1.3 Prepare Your Build Environment

- Update your build tools, like CMake or Bazel, to supported versions that facilitate the latest GoogleTest integration.
- Confirm the build environment includes any necessary flags or macros for C++17 compatibility (`set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` in CMake).

<Check>
Always validate your toolchain’s C++ standard support before starting the upgrade to avoid compilation failures.
</Check>

## 2. Step-by-Step Upgrade Workflow

### 2.1 Obtaining the Latest Version

- Clone or fetch the latest release tag from the official repository: `https://github.com/google/googletest`
- For CMake projects, you can use the FetchContent mechanism to automatically fetch and include the newest version in your build:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)
```

### 2.2 Integrate and Build

- When using CMake, verify inclusion via `add_subdirectory()` or linking against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` as needed.
- Adjust your project to link with the updated GoogleTest targets, e.g., `GTest::gtest`, `GTest::gmock`.

### 2.3 Address Breaking Changes

- Migrate legacy mock macros such as `MOCK_METHODn` to the modern `MOCK_METHOD` syntax.
- Adopt updated expectation semantics as described in the [Breaking Changes Guide](./breaking-changes.md).
- Review any custom matchers and refactor them in line with the improved matcher interfaces.

### 2.4 Update Compiler and Linker Flags

- Define necessary compiler flags to enforce C++17 standard usage.
- For Windows users, consider the updated runtime library linkage options to avoid linker mismatches.

### 2.5 Run Tests and Triage Failures

- Execute your test suite fully to identify any incompatibilities or failures introduced by the upgrade.
- Utilize verbose output and diagnostic flags to pinpoint issues.

### 2.6 Iterate and Refine

- Fix test failures by updating test code or mocks to align with the new framework behavior.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting & Quick Validation](../../getting-started/configuration-first-test-validation/troubleshooting-validation.md) guide if you encounter environment or setup issues.

## 3. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 3.1 Fixture Mismatches

- Ensure test fixtures are compatible with new GoogleTest memory management and lifecycle expectations.
- Avoid mixing legacy and modern test macros which can lead to linker or runtime conflicts.

### 3.2 Mock Method Upgrades

- Transition all `MOCK_METHODn` macros to the new `MOCK_METHOD` to avoid deprecation warnings and future removals.

### 3.3 Runtime Library Conflicts on Windows

- Check for consistent use of either dynamic or static CRT linkage across your project and GoogleTest.
- Enable the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if you require dynamic runtimes.

### 3.4 Threading Support

- Confirm pthread support macros are accurately set (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`) to avoid threading issues, especially on non-Unix platforms.

<Warning>
Do not ignore diagnostic warnings during build; they often indicate mismatches or deprecated usage that can disrupt test stability.
</Warning>

## 4. Pre- and Post-Upgrade Verification

### 4.1 Pre-Upgrade Checklist

- All tests pass on your current GoogleTest version.
- Build environment is stable and properly configured.
- Code repository is backed up or branching strategy is in place.

### 4.2 Post-Upgrade Checklist

- All existing tests run successfully without false positives or negatives.
- New GoogleTest features and macros are adopted where beneficial.
- Test execution environment (including continuous integration) runs as expected.

<Tip>
Leverage your continuous integration pipeline to automatically validate test runs after upgrades to catch regressions early.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices for Smooth Transition

- **Incremental Upgrades**: Upgrade GoogleTest in stages where possible to isolate issues.
- **Automate Tests**: Use automation and CI systems to repeatedly verify your test suite.
- **Stay Informed**: Regularly monitor the official [GoogleTest Release Notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) for upcoming changes.
- **Leverage Documentation**: Utilize guides such as the [Migration Guide](../../guides/integration-and-scenarios/migration-guide.md), [Mocking Workflow](../../guides/core-workflows/mocking-workflow.md), and [Project Integration](../../guides/integration-and-scenarios/project-integration.md).
- **Engage the Community**: For challenging issues, seek help through the community or official issue trackers.

<Check>
Keep your test suite up to date with modern idioms and APIs to benefit from ongoing improvements in test clarity, performance, and reliability.

## 7. Troubleshooting Upgrade Issues

### Common Issues

- **Test Failures Post-Upgrade**: Check for changes in expectation and mock behavior semantics.
- **Linker Errors on Windows**: Verify runtime library consistency and enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` if needed.
- **Compile Errors for MOCK_METHOD**: Ensure you’ve updated all legacy mocking macros.

### Diagnostic Tips

- Utilize verbose test output (`--gtest_verbose=1`) to trace issues.
- Rebuild cleanly after changing configurations.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting & Quick Validation](../../getting-started/configuration-first-test-validation/troubleshooting-validation.md) document for environment checks.
