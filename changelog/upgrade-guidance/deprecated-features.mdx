# Deprecated and Removed Features

The 'Deprecated and Removed Features' page details the deprecated and removed features and APIs within GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Its purpose is to inform developers about functionalities that are no longer supported or have been superseded, alongside deprecation timelines and recommended alternatives. This empowers developers to maintain and refactor their codebases proactively, reduce technical debt, and ensure smooth upgrade paths.

## Understanding Deprecated and Removed Features

Software projects evolve, and features once offered may become obsolete, replaced by improved APIs or removed to streamline the framework. This page helps you identify such transitions early so you can adapt your tests accordingly.

Deprecation notices provide:

- Clear identification of outdated APIs or features.
- Timelines indicating when a feature will be or was removed.
- Recommended alternatives to migrate your code.

Removal notices specify features completely removed from the framework that your code should no longer use.

By regularly consulting this page, you stay informed about changes that directly impact your test code's compatibility and maintainability.

## How to Use This Documentation

### Monitoring Deprecation Timelines

When you see a feature marked as deprecated:

1. Note the date or version since deprecation started.
2. Identify the scheduled removal version or date.
3. Plan to migrate your tests before removal to avoid breaking changes.

### Finding Alternatives

For each deprecated or removed feature, alternatives are provided. These could include:

- Newer APIs that supersede the older ones.
- Different patterns or idioms recommended by GoogleTest.
- Official replacement methods that offer identical or improved functionality.

Adopting these alternatives ensures your tests stay functional and benefit from improvements.

### Refactoring Your Tests

Refactoring should start by:

- Gradually replacing deprecated API usage with suggested alternatives.
- Running your test suite to verify behavior and ensure no regressions.
- Removing removed features entirely from your codebase.

Using the guidance here minimizes disruption during upgrades and reduces technical debt.

## Practical Examples of Deprecated Features and Migration

Below are typical scenarios illustrating how this documentation supports users during migration. Examples are conceptual and reflect the kind of guidance you can expect.

### Example 1: Migration from Old Mock Macros

Previously, you may have used older `MOCK_METHODn` macros to define mock methods. These macros are deprecated in favor of the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro with improved syntax.

```cpp
// Deprecated usage
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// Preferred usage
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int));
```

**Migration Tip:** Replace all `MOCK_METHODn` macros with `MOCK_METHOD` to align with the latest syntax and gain enhanced capabilities.

### Example 2: Transition from Unstrict to Strict Mocks

The default behavior for uninteresting calls was once 'naggy', generating warnings. You are encouraged to adopt `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers for better control.

```cpp
using ::testing::StrictMock;

StrictMock<MockClass> mock_obj;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod());
```

**Migration Tip:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, or `StrictMock` to enforce strict call verification.

### Example 3: Deprecated Flags or Test Options

Certain command-line flags or environment variables may be deprecated. This page lists such deprecations and alternatives.

**How to adapt:** Switch to the new flag names or adjust your test execution scripts according to the instructions provided.

## Deprecation Timeline and Removal Policy

GoogleTest follows a clear policy about feature deprecation and removal:

- A feature is marked as deprecated for at least one major or minor version.
- Users are given advance notice with documentation indicating the deprecation.
- Alternatives are provided to facilitate smooth transitions.
- After the deprecation period, the feature is removed in a subsequent release.

Adhering to this policy helps keep the codebase modern, safe, and efficient.

## Troubleshooting Deprecated Features

### Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring deprecation warnings:** Leads to build failures when upgrading to newer versions.
- **Missing alternative adoption:** Causes test failures or behavioral inconsistencies.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Regularly check this documentation during upgrade planning.
- Use compiler or runtime warnings as reminders to migrate.
- Test thoroughly after migrating deprecated features.

When encountering issues, consult related guides on [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](/changelog/upgrade-guidance/breaking-changes) and [Full Version History](/changelog/version-history/full-version-history).

## Best Practices

- Monitor deprecation notices early in your upgrade process.
- Refactor your tests promptly to avoid buildup of technical debt.
- Prefer stable, well-supported APIs described in the documentation.
- Leverage automated testing to catch regressions during migration.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Why are some features deprecated but still present?**
  To provide time for users to transition and avoid breaking existing code abruptly.

- **How long does the deprecation period last?**
  Typically, it spans at least one official release cycle.

- **Where can I find alternative APIs?**
  Alternatives are always documented alongside the deprecated feature's notice.
