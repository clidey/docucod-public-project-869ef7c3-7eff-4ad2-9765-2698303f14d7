# Deprecations and Removals

This page lists all features, interfaces, and build options that have been deprecated or removed in recent versions of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It guides developers on what changes to expect, when affected components will be phased out, and recommended alternatives to ensure smooth upgrade paths.

---

## Purpose and Value

Staying informed about deprecated or removed features helps you maintain compatibility with future releases and avoid surprises during upgrades. This page ensures you plan ahead by highlighting timelines and suggesting replacements or new approaches.

---

## Structure of This Page

### 1. Deprecated Features
- **Definition**: Features or interfaces that are officially discouraged and may be removed in future versions.
- **Impact**: Users will still find these features functional but are strongly encouraged to migrate off them.
- **Alternatives**: Recommended replacements or improved APIs to adopt.
- **Deprecation Timelines**: Expected duration before removal.

### 2. Removed Features
- **Definition**: Features or interfaces that have been completely removed in recent versions.
- **Implications**: Code depending on these features will no longer compile or run.
- **Migration Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance on how to update your code.

### 3. Build Options and Flags
- Lists any deprecated or removed build configuration options such as CMake flags, macros, or Bazel settings.
- Recommendations on updated build practices.

### 4. Interfaces and APIs
- Details on any APIs that have been deprecated or removed.
- Suggestions for new APIs or usage patterns.

### 5. Planning Your Migration
- Suggested workflows for migrating from deprecated features before they are removed.
- Best practices to future-proof your test code and build configurations.

### 6. Troubleshooting Deprecation Issues
- Common pitfalls encountered when upgrading.
- Workarounds and tips to resolve migration challenges.

## How to Use This Page

1. Identify if your project uses any deprecated or removed features listed here.
2. Review the recommended alternatives and timelines to understand urgency.
3. Follow migration instructions to update your code or build setup.
4. Consult related documentation for detailed guidance.

## Practical Examples

### Example: Mock Method Signature Updates
Deprecated usage of old-style `MOCK_METHODn` macros has been removed.

**Migration**: Switch to the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro with the new syntax.

```cpp
// Deprecated
MOCK_CONST_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// Recommended
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int), (const));
```

### Example: Build Configuration Flags
The flag `BUILD_GMOCK` in CMake build scripts was deprecated.

**Migration**: Use `BUILD_GMOCK` only when building GoogleMock library specifically; prefer building GoogleTest with GoogleMock integration by default as described in the installation guides.

## Deprecation Timeline

GoogleTest follows a policy to maintain deprecated features for at least one major release cycle before removal. Changes are announced in advance in this page and the [Breaking Changes and Migration Notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/upgrade-guidance/breaking-changes.md).

---

## Recommendations

- Prefer the new unified mocking macros and avoid old-style mocks.
- Update build configurations according to the latest recommended flags.
- Monitor release notes regularly to track upcoming removals.
- Use the [Breaking Changes and Migration Notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/upgrade-guidance/breaking-changes.md) page alongside this for detailed migration steps.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues During Deprecation Migration">
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors Due to Removed Macros">
If your code fails to compile due to removed `MOCK_METHODn` or related macros, ensure all mocks use the new `MOCK_METHOD` syntax. Consult the Mock Class and Method Definitions page for detailed examples.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Failures Related to Deprecated Flags">
Review your CMakeLists.txt or Bazel BUILD files and remove flags that have been deprecated or removed. Refer to the official build system integration guides for updated configurations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Behavioral Changes After Migration">
Test behaviors might differ slightly due to changes in mock strictness modes or handling of uninteresting calls. Inspect test logs carefully and use strictness mode documentation to adjust expectations appropriately.
