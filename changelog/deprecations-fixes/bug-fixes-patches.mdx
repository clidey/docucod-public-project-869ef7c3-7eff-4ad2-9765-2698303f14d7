# Bug Fixes and Patch Notes

The **Bug Fixes and Patch Notes** page provides a clear, detailed record of maintenance updates, bug fixes, and minor changes included in each GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. This documentation enables users to stay informed about improvements that enhance the reliability, security, and overall stability of their testing projects.

## How to Use This Page

This section helps users quickly identify the bug fixes and patches relevant to their needs without sifting through entire release notes. It empowers developers and test engineers to understand how specific issues have been resolved and whether updates affect their test suites or mocking strategies.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Maintenance Updates

For each release, this page summarizes key fixes and minor improvements focused on enhancing the robustness of the mocking framework and test execution.

### Example: Fixes in Recent GoogleMock Releases

- Corrected the evaluation of argument qualifiers in mocked methods to prevent miscompilation on certain platforms.
- Resolved corner cases where uninteresting calls caused misleading warnings or failures.
- Fixed deadlocks that could occur when a mock object was deleted while expectations were still active.
- Improved default action handling to avoid unexpected test failures due to missing default return values.
- Patched concurrency issues related to setting and clearing mock expectations in multi-threaded tests.

### Common Fix Categories

- **Mock Method Behavior:** Fixes ensuring mock methods correctly mimic original method qualifiers such as `const`, `noexcept`, and reference qualifiers.
- **Expectation Management:** Bug fixes related to the lifecycle, retirement, and verification of expectations.
- **Thread Safety:** Improvements in locking to prevent race conditions during test execution.
- **Warning and Error Reporting:** Clarifications to warning messages for uninteresting and unexpected calls, making the diagnostics more actionable.
- **Action and Matcher Enhancements:** Corrections to built-in actions and matchers for complex argument types and overloaded methods.

## Maintaining Test Suite Reliability

Keeping test harnesses stable is paramount. This page highlights how addressed bugs impact test behaviors, guiding users to review and adopt fixes.

<Tip>
Always test your code with the latest patch releases to benefit from bug fixes that may resolve flaky tests, reduce spurious warnings, and improve mocking accuracy.

## Upgrading and Compatibility Tips

- For projects dependent on specific mocking behaviors, review the fixed bugs carefully before upgrading.
- Consult [Breaking Changes and Upgrade Guidance](../changelog/breaking-changes-upgrades/upgrade-guides) for any compatibility issues related to bug fixes.
- Before applying patches, ensure your mocks and expectations follow best practices as outlined in the [gMock Cookbook](../guides/core-testing-patterns/mocking-advanced-patterns) and the [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md).

## Troubleshooting and Known Issues

While bug fixes improve stability, some issues may persist in edge cases. Refer to the [Troubleshooting Test & Mock Failures FAQ](../faq/troubleshooting-advanced/debugging-failures) to diagnose unexpected behaviors that might appear before official patches are available.
