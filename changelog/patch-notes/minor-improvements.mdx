# Minor Improvements and Tweaks

This page details minor enhancements, code tidy-ups, and refactorings related specifically to the `gmock-nice-strict.h` header, which implements the `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` class templates within the GoogleMock framework. These changes focus on improving maintainability and the user experience of strictness modes for mocks without introducing new features or breaking changes.

---

## Overview of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`

GoogleMock offers three primary wrappers to control mock behavior around *uninteresting calls* â€” calls to mock methods without explicit expectations:

- **NiceMock<T>**: Silences warnings on uninteresting calls, allowing them to pass silently.
- **NaggyMock<T>**: Prints warnings on uninteresting calls but allows them.
- **StrictMock<T>**: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

These types are wrappers on user-defined mock classes (`T`) and inherit all of their constructors, making them drop-in replacements to provide different strictness enforcement in testing.

### Usage Summary

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

// Example: Creating a nice mock of MockFoo
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;

// Similar usage for naggy and strict mocks.
```

Currently, base mock classes behave like `NaggyMock<T>` by default, but future versions intend to switch the default to `NiceMock<T>` for improved test maintainability.

## Minor Enhancements and Internal Improvements

### 1. Empty Base Class Optimization

To optimize memory layout of these wrappers, conditional platform-specific directives ensure the Empty Base Class Optimization (EBCO) is applied, notably on Windows:

- On MSVC and compatible compilers, the wrappers are annotated with `__declspec(empty_bases)`.
- On other platforms, this is a no-op.

This change improves the packing and performance in environments where compiler behavior benefits from explicit empty base optimization annotations.

### 2. Registration and Deregistration of Mock Strictness Behavior

Each wrapper manages its mock's behavior during its lifetime by registering and deregistering corresponding call reactions:

- `NiceMockImpl` calls `Mock::AllowUninterestingCalls()` on construction, enabling silent handling.
- `NaggyMockImpl` calls `Mock::WarnUninterestingCalls()` to enable warnings.
- `StrictMockImpl` calls `Mock::FailUninterestingCalls()` to convert uninteresting calls to errors.

These are deregistered upon destruction to restore the original mock state.

This change ensures that the mock's behavior is strictly tied to the wrapper's lifetime, preventing leakage or incorrect strictness after destruction.

### 3. Compile-time Safety Enhancements

Static assertions enforce that applying one of these wrappers to a mock class which already has a strictness modifier is disallowed. This prevents unintended nesting like `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockFoo>>`, which is unsupported and could cause confusing behavior.

The size of these wrappers is asserted to be identical to their base mock class to avoid unexpected memory overhead, ensuring they are lightweight and do not add padding.

### 4. Constructor Forwarding Improvements

Constructors of the wrappers forward arguments perfectly to the underlying mock class constructors, including:

- An explicit single-argument template constructor.
- Variadic templates for multiple arguments.

This enables users to instantiate wrapped mocks with any constructor parameters the base mock class defines, without breaking compatibility.

### 5. Deleted Copy Operations

Copy constructors and assignment operators are explicitly deleted on these wrappers to prevent accidental copying of mocks, which could lead to unexpected test behavior or memory management bugs.

This promotes recommended practice of handling mocks by value or reference carefully.

## Impact on Users

These improvements do not change existing APIs or introduce new behavior from the user perspective. Instead, they:

- Improve the performance of these wrappers by optimizing layout.
- Strengthen type safety and error prevention.
- Ensure consistent lifecycle behavior to prevent stale or leaked strictness settings.
- Retain full compatibility with existing mock classes and their constructors.

### Practical Benefits

- Tests using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` will have more predictable lifecycle behavior.
- Reduced memory footprint and compiler warnings especially on Windows platforms.
- Compile-time errors if user tries unsupported nested wrappers, helping catch errors early.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use these wrappers consistently to control strictness according to test needs.
- Avoid nesting different strictness wrappers; prefer a single one at a time.
- Take advantage of the improved constructor forwarding to pass parameters seamlessly.
- Remember that the behavior modification applies only to mock methods defined **directly** in the mock class using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.

## Troubleshooting

- If a nested strictness wrapper is accidentally applied, expect a compile-time error indicating the issue.
- If warnings about uninteresting calls occur unexpectedly, verify if the correct wrapper is applied.
- Note that strictness wrappers may not affect mock methods defined in base classes due to C++ limitations.

## Summary

This page documents minor code improvements and internal refactorings in the GoogleMock strictness mode wrappers defined in `gmock-nice-strict.h`. Users leveraging `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` will benefit from better optimization, safer usage patterns, and more predictable mock behavior, without needing to modify existing tests.

### Example: Using a Nice Mock with Constructor Arguments

```cpp
class MockBar {
 public:
  explicit MockBar(const std::string& s);
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (), (override));
};

// Create a nice mock passing constructor args
NiceMock<MockBar> nice_bar("hello");
nice_bar.DoSomething();
```

<Info>
  Remember, `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` only affect mock methods defined directly in the mock class via `MOCK_METHOD`. Methods inherited from base mocks may not be influenced due to compiler and C++ constraints.
