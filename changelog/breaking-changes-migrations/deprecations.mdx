# Deprecation Notices

This section is dedicated to keeping users informed about features, APIs, or platforms within GoogleTest and GoogleMock that are scheduled for removal or no longer recommended for use. Understanding deprecations is essential for future-proofing your projects, maintaining compatibility, and ensuring smooth migrations.

## Understanding Deprecation in GoogleTest and GoogleMock

Deprecation is a formal notification that a particular feature, API, or platform support will be phased out in future releases. GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide advance warnings about deprecated items, explaining why they are deprecated and offering guidance for migration.

As a user, you should take these notices seriously to:

- Avoid relying on soon-to-be-removed features.
- Prepare your codebase ahead of time by adopting alternatives.
- Ensure longer-term maintainability and compatibility.


## Types of Deprecation Notices

### 1. Deprecated Macros and APIs

Certain assertion or mocking macros may be deprecated in favor of newer, more consistent, or safer alternatives. For instance, older versions of `MOCK_METHODn` macros have been superseded by the generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro for better type safety and flexibility.

**Action**: Update your mocks to use the current preferred macros. For example, convert

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));
```

into

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int));
```

Refer to the [Mocking Reference](../api-reference/core-apis/mocking.md#macros) and [gMock Cookbook](../guides/writing-and-running-tests/gmock_cook_book.md#Old-Style-MOCK_METHODn-Macros) for details.

### 2. Interface and Class Changes

Some classes or interfaces may evolve, deprecating certain methods or behaviors. For example, certain matchers or action interfaces might be replaced by more efficient or expressive versions.

**Action**: Review your use of interfaces and update to the latest recommended patterns, such as using polymorphic matchers defined via the `MATCHER` macros or `MATCHER_P` for parameterized matchers.

---

### 3. Platform or Compiler Support

GoogleTest provides wide-ranging platform support, but occasionally support for specific platforms, compilers, or language dialects may be deprecated due to low usage or unmaintainability.

**Action**: Confirm your development environment's compatibility regularly and review the [Supported Platforms & Requirements](../../overview/integration-ecosystem/supported-platforms) page to ensure ongoing support.

## Deprecation Timelines and Migration Paths

A well-defined timeline accompanies each deprecation notice to give users ample time for migration. The typical flow involves:

1. **Announcement**: Deprecation is announced in Release Highlights and changelog pages without removal.
2. **Warning**: Compilation or runtime warnings may be introduced to alert developers.
3. **Removal**: The deprecated feature is removed after one or more release cycles.

We encourage users to adopt the following migration process:

- **Stay Updated**: Regularly check the changelog, release notes, and deprecation notices.
- **Plan Migration**: Incorporate updates into your development schedule.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use GoogleTest's own mechanisms to validate changes.
- **Seek Guidance**: Use the Upgrade & Migration Guides and relevant documentation.

For example, when moving between major versions, consult the [Upgrade & Migration Guides](../changelog/breaking-changes-migrations/upgrade-guides) for detailed instructions.


## How Deprecations Affect Your Tests

GoogleTest and GoogleMock typically maintain backward compatibility for minor versions, but deprecated constructs should be avoided.

- **Mocking API**: Deprecated mocking macros or conventions should be revised to avoid future breakage.
- **Assertion Macros**: Prefer `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` macros documented as current.
- **Matchers and Actions**: Adopt modern, polymorphic matcher and action patterns.

Deprecated behaviors may cause warnings during compilation or test runs, but tests will continue to run until removal.

## Practical Tips to Handle Deprecation

- **Proactively Refactor**: When you see a deprecation, prioritize refactoring
  rather than delaying.
- **Use Static Analysis Tools**: Tools or linters may catch deprecated usage.
- **Suppress Warnings Judiciously**: Only when you are certain the deprecated usage is harmless short-term.
- **Automated Testing**: Run your test suites with GoogleTest's latest version early to catch issues.

## Troubleshooting Common Deprecation Issues

<Tip>
If you encounter unexpected failures or warnings related to deprecated features during test runs or compile time, verify:

- That your code does not mix deprecated and current APIs.
- All mocks are defined with current `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Your build environment complies with new compiler standards (C++17+ required).
- Warnings are addressed rather than ignored.

Use the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-issues) page for help.
