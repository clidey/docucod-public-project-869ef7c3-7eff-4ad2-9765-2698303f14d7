# Breaking Changes & Deprecated Features

This documentation page details all breaking changes, deprecated APIs, and removed features across GoogleTest releases. It delivers practical context and recommended alternatives to help you recognize and adapt to impactful updates, ensuring your testing code remains robust and up to date.

---

## Understanding Breaking Changes

Breaking changes signal modifications to GoogleTest that **may require code updates** to maintain compatibility. These changes typically involve API modifications, semantic alterations, or behavioral shifts that deviate from previous versions.

As a user, your goals should be to:

- Identify whether a breaking change affects your existing tests or mocking code.
- Understand the reasoning and value behind the change.
- Follow recommended migration paths with minimal disruption.

By proactively addressing breaking changes, you safeguard your test suites against failures and leverage improvements efficiently.

---

## Deprecated APIs and Features

GoogleTest deprecates certain features to phase out outdated constructs in favor of better alternatives. Deprecated APIs continue to function but will be removed in a future release.

### What to Do When You Encounter Deprecation Warnings

- Review the affected APIs or features in your codebase.
- Consult the suggested alternatives or replacements.
- Gradually migrate to the new APIs to avoid abrupt breakage.

This approach promotes smoother, controlled upgrades.

## Notable Breaking Changes by Release

Below is a curated list of significant breaking changes with rationale and guidance:

### Recent Stable Release Highlights

- **C++17 Minimum Requirement**: The entire codebase now mandates C++17 compliance. You must ensure your compiler and build environment support this standard.

- **Unified Repository Integration**: GoogleTest and GoogleMock are merged into a single repository, simplifying dependency management.

- **Test Discovery Enhancements**: The test discovery mechanism is improved for faster and more reliable test execution.

- **Assertion and Death Test Updates**: Some assertion macros and death test behaviors are refined to enhance reliability and clarity.

**Migration Tips:**

- Upgrade your compiler to a C++17 compatible version.
- Adjust your build scripts and includes to the unified repo.
- Verify your tests still compile and run with updated death test styles.

---

## Deprecated or Removed Features

- Legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros are still supported but **migration to the generic `MOCK_METHOD` macro is strongly encouraged** for simpler, more consistent mocking.

- Deprecated command line flags or environment variables are either removed or replaced; review release notes before upgrading.

- Certain watcher or event listener APIs may have been modified or removedâ€”update your custom listeners accordingly.

## Migration Paths and Guidance

### Step-by-Step Upgrade Strategy

1. **Assess Impact:** Determine which parts of your test code use deprecated or altered APIs.
2. **Compiler Upgrade:** Enable a minimum of C++17 compilation.
3. **Code Adjustments:** Replace deprecated macros and patterns with supported alternatives.
4. **Test Rerun:** Run all tests; address any failures or warnings.
5. **Review Death Test Styles:** Explicitly set the death test style flag in your `main()` if needed.
6. **Consult Documentation:** Use the mocking cookbook and assertions reference to verify complex expectation usages.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Ignoring warning messages that appear during compilation or test execution.
- Mixing deprecated and new API styles within the same test file.
- Neglecting to update build dependencies to the unified repository layout.

---

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Warning: Unexpected Mock Function Calls

If you see warnings about "uninteresting calls", consider:

- Using `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting warnings when these calls are acceptable.
- Reviewing your test expectations to add explicit `EXPECT_CALL` where verification is needed.

### Handling Removed Macros or Features

Search your code for macros or API usages flagged as deprecated. Google recommends transitioning to their newer counterparts, such as:

- Replace `MOCK_METHODn` family macros with the unified `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Use modern matchers and actions patterns for more expressive tests.

If your setup scripts or test runners rely on removed flags, update them accordingly based on migration notes.

## Best Practices for Smooth Upgrades

- **Read Release Notes Thoroughly:** Each release documents breaking and deprecated features with migration help.
- **Upgrade Incrementally:** Test each change carefully when adjusting tests.
- **Use Validation Checklists:** The [Validation Checklist](../getting-started/first-steps-usage-validation/validation-checklist.md) helps confirm proper setup after upgrades.
- **Leverage Mocking Cookbooks and Guides:** For mocking changes, the [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md) is invaluable for rewriting tests.
- **Engage with Community:** Visit community forums or GitHub issues if you encounter non-trivial migration challenges.
