# Bug Fixes & Patches

GoogleTest continuously strives to provide a stable, reliable, and high-quality C++ testing framework. This page documents the bugs and regressions addressed in each release, emphasizing the specific issues resolved, their impact on users, and references to the corresponding issue tracking or commit links. Understanding these fixes reassures users about ongoing product improvements and assists in diagnosing problems encountered in previous versions.

## How to Use This Page

If you are experiencing unexpected behavior, crashes, or assertion failures in GoogleTest, this page helps you:

- Identify whether the issue has been fixed in a recent release.
- Understand the scope and impact of specific bug fixes.
- Gain confidence in the correctness and robustness of the software.

We recommend reviewing the latest applied patches before upgrading or reporting bugs.

## Recent Bug Fix Highlights

### Thread Safety Enhancements
- Fixed concurrency issues allowing multiple threads to safely use `SCOPED_TRACE()` and various GoogleTest assertions simultaneously. This ensures reliable test behavior in multithreaded test executables.

### Failure Detection and Reporting Improvements
- Corrected scenarios where failures in threads other than the main one were previously overlooked by the failure-detection macros. Enhanced macros such as `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE_ON_ALL_THREADS` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE_ON_ALL_THREADS` now accurately monitor failures across all active threads.

### Robustness of Assertion Macros
- Addressed edge cases where fatal and non-fatal failure detection macros (`EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE`, `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE`) were not recognizing failures occurring outside the invoking thread, improving test result accuracy.

### Expanded Support for Custom Failure Contexts
- Improved reliability of property recording during multi-threaded test executions, where test properties (keys and values) are logged correctly for each thread without collision or loss.

## Detailed Issue References

While this page does not list every fixed bug exhaustively, notable issues resolved recently include:

- Assertion and property recording synchronization across threads to prevent race conditions during test execution.
- Enhancements to failure expectation macros to support detection of failures from any thread within a test.
- Fixes ensuring that test suite and test fixture setup/teardown failures are properly reported and do not falsely mark the subsequent tests as passing.

For a complete list of resolved issues, please visit the main [GoogleTest GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) and review the release notes for each version.

## Why These Fixes Matter to You

Consider a scenario where you are working on a large-scale application with multithreaded components. Prior to these fixes, failures occurring in background or newly spawned threads might not be correctly reported, causing confusing test results and potentially masking bugs. With improved thread safety and failure monitoring:

- Your tests are more reliable and reflective of real-world issues.
- Debugging is streamlined because failure contexts are preserved accurately.
- Test reports include detailed properties and traces relevant to each thread, aiding diagnostics.

## Troubleshooting Tips Related to Bug Fixes

### Symptoms of Previous Bugs
- Failures in threads other than the main one not triggering fatal failure macros.
- Loss or overwriting of test property key-values when recorded concurrently.
- Spurious passes where tests should have failed due to missing failure detection.

### Recommended Actions
- Upgrade to the latest GoogleTest release to obtain all fixes.
- Use enhanced macros like `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE_ON_ALL_THREADS` for thread-aware failure verification.
- Leverage `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to failures and clarify multithreaded test flows.
