# Supported Platforms & Toolchains Changelog

This document tracks changes and updates related specifically to the Supported Platforms & Toolchains page of GoogleTest. It helps users verify compatibility, prepare their environment, and align their build systems and compilers with the latest releases.

---

## 1. Overview of Platform and Toolchain Support

GoogleTest maintains thorough support for a wide range of operating systems, compilers, and build chain configurations, aligning with the foundational C++17 standard requirement and Google's overarching Foundational C++ Support Policy. This changelog highlights how platform and toolchain compatibility evolves across releases.

Users rely on this information to validate their environments and anticipate necessary upgrades or tweaks to continue seamless testing with GoogleTest.

---

## 2. Recent Updates and Changes

### 2.1 Baseline C++ Standard Requirement
- GoogleTest now strictly requires a C++17 compliant environment. Any compiler or platform support below C++17 is officially unsupported starting with recent releases.
- This ensures modern language features and safer code, enhancing user experience and compatibility.

### 2.2 Platform-Specific Support Enhancements
- Expanded platform detection includes newer OS variants and embedded targets detected via macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX_ANDROID`, and specific embedded platforms like `GTEST_OS_ESP32`, `GTEST_OS_XTENSA`, and `GTEST_OS_NXP_QN9090`.
- Detection and conditional compilation for Windows Desktop, Mobile, Phone, RT, and TV Title partitions have been refined.
- Linux variants, BSDs, Solaris, z/OS, and emerging OSes like Fuchsia and Haiku have explicit recognition for improved portability.

### 2.3 Threading and Synchronization
- Thread support is enabled broadly via detection of POSIX pthread availability (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) and enhancements for Windows threading primitives.
- For Windows and Clang users, configurations around runtime linkage—static vs dynamic CRT—is facilitated by CMake options like `gtest_force_shared_crt` to prevent linker mismatches.

### 2.4 Build System Integrations
- CMake support has been augmented with clear guidance on generating native build files for multiple platforms and integrating GoogleTest either standalone or as part of larger projects.
- Bazel build settings have matured to resolve platform constraints, notably on QNX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Fuchsia, and Windows, via `config_setting` selectors.
- pkg-config files are distributed and annotated to aid in build flags resolution; cross-compilation use cases include guidance on sysroot-aware environment variables to adjust `-I` and `-L` paths.

### 2.5 Macros and Configuration Control Flags
- Users can control platform-specific behavior and build configurations via compiler flags such as `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0|1`, `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`, and macro redefinitions (e.g., `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`) to prevent macro collisions.

## 3. Detailed Platform List Updates

Platforms supported and recognized by GoogleTest macros now include:

- Windows (Desktop, Mobile, Phone, RT, TV, and Games partitions)
- Various BSDs: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly
- Linux (including Android variant)
- Apple platforms: macOS, iOS
- Embedded platforms: ESP8266, ESP32, Xtensa, NXP QN9090, NRF52
- Other Unix-like: Solaris, AIX, HP-UX
- Novel and emerging OSes: Fuchsia, GNU Hurd, Haiku
- z/OS

This expanded and precise detection aids conditional compilation and informs users about GoogleTest’s operational scope.

## 4. Compiler and CMake Integration Notes

- GoogleTest enforces C++17 standards in all compiler builds. Users should specify `-std=c++17` or `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` in CMake.
- CMake scripts (`CMakeLists.txt`) are provided for standalone builds and seamless integration as subdirectories in user projects, preserving consistent compiler and linker settings.
- CMake options such as `gtest_force_shared_crt` resolve Visual Studio runtime mismatches by aligning static or dynamic runtime linkage.
- For users utilizing pkg-config, environment variables `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` and `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` must be correctly set to handle cross-compilation and sysroot adjustments.

---

## 5. Bazel Build System Updates

- Bazel config settings enable platform-specific constraints and dependencies.
- Various platform rule configurations optimize linkage and library dependencies, including flags for thread support (`-pthread`) on Unix-like systems.
- Special handling for Fuchsia dependencies is included to avoid build failures.
- Bazel aliases and rules distinguish between test-only libraries (`gtest_for_library`) and runtime test libraries.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting Tips

- **C++ Version Compatibility**: Ensure your compiler fully supports C++17 features. Failing this results in build errors.
- **Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows**: Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` in CMake to match your project’s runtime linkage.
- **Cross-compilation Sysroot Handling**: When using pkg-config files in cross-compile environments, set `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` and `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` appropriately to avoid linking to build host libraries.
- **Macro Naming Collisions**: If GoogleTest assertion macros conflict with other libraries, use macros like `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` to rename GoogleTest macros, adjusting existing test code accordingly.
- **Threading Support**: Confirm that your platform has pthreads or equivalent; disable threading with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if not.

## 7. Practical Recommendations for Users

- Before upgrading, verify your platform and toolchain match the updated requirements documented here.
- When embedding GoogleTest into existing projects, prefer integrating via CMake’s `add_subdirectory()` or use the FetchContent module for better version control.
- Use provided pkg-config files to simplify compiler and linker flag management.
- For Windows users, carefully manage runtime linkage flags to prevent linker errors.
- Consult the [System Requirements](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/setup-requirements/system-prerequisites.md) and [Preparing Your Development Environment](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/setup-requirements/prepare-environment.md) documentation to configure your environment accordingly.
