## Example: Updating Your Build Configuration

To illustrate accommodating the new C++17 requirement, update your build flags as follows:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

This ensures your project builds with the correct language version aligned with GoogleTest's latest requirements.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **C++17 Support Missing:** If compilation fails due to missing C++17 features, verify your compiler version and update if necessary.

- **Documentation Not Found:** Transition your bookmarks and links to the new [GitHub Pages documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for up-to-date content.

- **Integration Issues:** Review your project linkage and build to reflect the merged GoogleTest and GoogleMock layout.

For additional guidance, refer to the Getting Started and FAQ sections in the user guide.
