## Release Highlights

### Version 1.17.0

GoogleTest's most recent major release, version 1.17.0, delivers important updates focused on modern C++ compatibility and streamlined integration for improved user experience:

- **C++17 Requirement**: This release mandates a minimum C++17 standard for compiling the framework. Users should ensure their build environment and projects are configured accordingly to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Unified GoogleTest and GoogleMock**: This version continues the combined maintenance of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, simplifying workflows and enhancing the integration between unit testing and mocking features.
- **Cross-Platform Improvements**: Enhancements in the CMake build scripts support a wide variety of platforms, including better handling of runtime linkage options on Windows, and improved support for Linux and macOS.
- **Build Flexibility with CMake**:
    - Users can now opt to build only GoogleTest without GoogleMock by setting the `BUILD_GMOCK` option to `OFF`.
    - Shared library builds are supported with explicit compiler flags, enabling users to choose static or dynamic linking as suits their needs.
- **Improved Documentation and Guidance**: New and updated user guides, especially around build system integration, testing workflows, and macro customization.


## Compatibility and Upgrade Notes

### Compiler and Platform Requirements
- Requires C++17 support.
- Confirm compilers such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC meet this standard.
- Supported platforms include Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Migration Guidance

Users upgrading from versions prior to 1.17 should:

- Review build configurations to ensure C++17 is enabled.
- Verify or adjust CMake options, such as `BUILD_GMOCK` and runtime linkage settings like `gtest_force_shared_crt`, especially on Windows.
- Update any custom macros or flag settings to align with new naming conventions and supported flags.

<Tip>
For a smooth upgrade, run your test suites in an isolated environment first and consult the official release notes for any edge cases.
</Tip>

## Key Features and User Impact

### Streamlined Build Process

The new CMake configuration enables both standalone builds and easy integration within existing CMake projects. For example:

```bash
# To build GoogleTest-only:
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
make
sudo make install
```

This reduces overhead for projects that do not require mocking features.

### Flexible Runtime Library Linking

On Windows, where runtime library mismatches often cause build errors, GoogleTest offers the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option:

```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```

This option ensures consistent runtime linkage between GoogleTest and the project, preventing common linker errors.

### Robust Multithreading and Shared Library Support

- New macros allow forcing pthread usage or disabling it, ensuring thread safety in environments where pthread detection may be unreliable.
- Support for building and linking GoogleTest as shared DLLs (or shared objects on Unix) increases flexibility for complex projects.

### Macro Renaming to Avoid Conflicts

To prevent naming conflicts in projects defining overlapping macros, users can now redefine GoogleTest macros to avoid clashes. For instance, adding:

```bash
-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
```

will mandate using `GTEST_TEST` instead of `TEST` macro.


## Practical Adoption Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare Your Environment">
Ensure your compiler supports C++17 and your build tools (such as CMake v3.14 or higher) are installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Clone and Configure">
Clone the GoogleTest repository and create a build directory.
</Step>
<Step title="Build with CMake">
Run cmake with your desired options, such as building GoogleTest only or including GoogleMock.
</Step>
<Step title="Compile and Install">
Use your platform's build tool (make, Visual Studio, Xcode) to build and install.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Your Projects">
Adjust compiler flags for runtime linkage, shared library usage, and macro renaming as needed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Tip>
If you encounter linker errors related to runtime libraries on Windows, verify that `gtest_force_shared_crt` is set consistently across your GoogleTest build and your application.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Failure to comply with the C++17 requirement will result in compilation errors. Verify your compiler version before upgrading.
</Warning>
