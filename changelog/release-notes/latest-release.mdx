- **Key Platform Requirement:** Starting from the 1.17.x line, **C++17** or higher is required to build and use GoogleTest.

## What’s New and Important?

### 1. C++17 Language Requirement

All users must ensure their projects target **at least the C++17 standard** to successfully compile and use this version of GoogleTest. This upgrade enables GoogleTest to adopt modern C++ features, resulting in improved code safety, performance, and maintainability.

### 2. Documentation Publishing
