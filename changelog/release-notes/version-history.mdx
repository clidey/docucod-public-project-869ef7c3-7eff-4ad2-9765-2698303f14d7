## Recent Releases

### v1.17.0 (Release Date: 2022-10-01)
- **New Features**:
  - Added improved support for mocking methods with move-only types, enabling seamless use of `std::unique_ptr` and similar objects in mock interfaces.
  - Enhanced `MOCK_METHOD` macro to fully support C++17 features including `noexcept` and reference qualifiers.
- **Improvements**:
  - Upgraded default compiler flags for better compatibility with modern MSVC, Clang, and GCC versions.
  - Refined thread safety for mocks, especially supporting multi-threaded test environments.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed issue where `EXPECT_CALL` with chained `.WillOnce()` actions sometimes ignored order.
  - Resolved warnings caused by duplicate flag definitions in custom environments.
- **Deprecations**:
  - Old-style `MOCK_METHODn` macros are still supported but marked deprecated; users encouraged to migrate to `MOCK_METHOD`.

### v1.16.0 (Release Date: 2021-06-15)
- **New Features**:
  - Introduced `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime linking with user projects in Visual Studio.
  - Added `StrictMock`, `NiceMock`, and `NaggyMock` classes that control mock call strictness levels with clearer interfaces.
- **Improvements**:
  - More detailed logging through `--gmock_verbose` flag to facilitate debugging expectations and mock call sequences.
  - Simplified initialization functions for command-line flag parsing.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Corrected handling of comma-delimited types in `MOCK_METHOD` to avoid parsing errors.
- **Deprecations**:
  - Planned removal of legacy `EXPECT_CALL` syntax without chaining clause support, user notification added.

### v1.15.0 (Release Date: 2019-12-01)
- **New Features**:
  - Added support for default actions on mocks via `ON_CALL` macros with `.WillByDefault()` to define fallback behaviors.
  - Enabled partial mocking to allow mixing real and mocked methods within classes.
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhanced documentation and examples for matchers, actions, and expectations.
  - Improved error messages when mock expectations fail to aid in faster troubleshooting.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Resolved race conditions in multi-threaded tests interacting with mock objects.

## Breaking Changes

- Starting from v1.16.0, the old `MOCK_METHODn` macros are officially deprecated in favor of the new `MOCK_METHOD`, which provides more expressive and flexible mocking capabilities including qualifiers handling.
- The flag naming and handling conventions have been streamlined, so custom flag macros should be adapted to the new `GMOCK_FLAG(name)` and related macros defined in `gmock-port.h`.

---

## Migration Paths

- Users moving from pre-2019 versions are recommended to convert all legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macro usages to the newer `MOCK_METHOD` macro, which provides consistent syntax and better support for reference qualifiers, `noexcept`, and calling conventions.
- For handling move-only types in mock methods, adopt lambda-based `WillOnce` or `WillRepeatedly` actions instead of returning move-only types directly with `Return()`.

## Troubleshooting Common Version Upgrade Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Upgrade Challenges">
<Accordion title="Deprecated Macro Usage">
If tests fail to compile after upgrading due to old `MOCK_METHODn` macros, replace them with `MOCK_METHOD` macro specifying method name, return type, and argument list with optional qualifiers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Move-Only Type Handling">
When mocking methods returning or accepting move-only types, avoid using `Return(std::move(...))` repeatedly since it consumes the object. Use lambdas with `WillOnce` or `WillRepeatedly` to return fresh instances each call.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flag Parsing Differences">
The handling of command-line flags for GoogleMock has been standardized. When creating custom flags, use macros from `gmock-port.h` and ensure flag names follow the `gmock_` prefix convention.
