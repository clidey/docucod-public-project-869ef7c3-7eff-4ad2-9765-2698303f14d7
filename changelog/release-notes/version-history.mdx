# Version History

GoogleTest's **Version History** page offers a detailed, chronological record of all major and minor releases of the framework. This resource empowers users to explore the evolution of GoogleTest over time, understand key improvements, and gauge the pace and focus areas of ongoing development.

## Purpose and Value

This page serves as a centralized timeline that documents each release's important details, including:

- **Release dates**
- **Version identifiers**
- **Headlining changes** such as new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, or deprecations

By consulting this overview, users can make informed decisions about upgrading, track when features were introduced, and align their development work with GoogleTest's maintenance schedule.

## How to Use This Page

### Quickly Find a Version
Start with the latest releases listed first to find the most current updates. If you're troubleshooting an issue or planning an upgrade, scan recent entries to see relevant fixes or breaking changes.

### Understand Development Trends
The chronological format reveals patterns about how actively GoogleTest evolves, with visibility into whether recent updates focus more on functionality additions or maintenance.

### Track Feature Introductions
Each entry highlights significant features or changes, helping you identify when capabilities you rely on were added or modified.

## Typical Entry Format
Each version entry lists:

- **Version Number**: Following semantic versioning (e.g., 1.16.0)
- **Release Date**: The exact date the version was published
- **Headline Changes**: Key feature add-ons, enhancements, bug fixes, or deprecations

This consistent format facilitates easy scanning and understanding of each release's impact.

## Practical Tips for Users

- **Stay Up to Date**: Regularly check this page to monitor new releases, so you can take advantage of improvements and security patches.
- **Plan Upgrades Carefully**: Review headline changes for any potential breaking changes or deprecated features that require code updates.
- **Use in Documentation and Support**: Reference this page when seeking help or reporting issues, to clarify which version you are using.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to Verify Compatibility**: Each release may carry implicit changes in dependencies or platform support; always check the version history before upgrading.
- **Ignoring Minor Releases**: Minor updates often include important bug fixes or security patches alongside small features.

## Relation to Other Documentation

- Refer to the [Release Notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed change logs.
- Visit the [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/changelog/upgrade-guides-and-migration/breaking-changes.md) page for migration advice.
