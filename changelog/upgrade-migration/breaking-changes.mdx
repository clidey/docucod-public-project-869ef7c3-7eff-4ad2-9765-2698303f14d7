# Breaking Changes & Migration Notes

This page documents explicit breaking changes introduced in each major or minor GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. It details interface modifications, removed or deprecated features, and behavioral shifts that require users to update their existing codebases. Clear migration guidance and references to supporting documentation are provided to facilitate smooth upgrades.

## Understanding Breaking Changes

GoogleTest and GoogleMock maintain a stable API whenever possible. However, to advance the platform, to fix design issues, or to adopt modern C++ features, changes that are not backwards compatible occasionally occur. These breaking changes may include:

- Removal or alteration of public APIs such as macros, classes, or functions
- Changes in behavior affecting test results or mock verifications
- Updated requirements for compiler versions or C++ standards
- Modified expectations on mock method declarations or usages

Users affected by breaking changes will be alerted in this document with recommendations for migration.

## Migration Guidance by Version

### Version 1.17.0 (Latest Release Highlights)

- **Minimum C++ Standard Requirement:**
  - GoogleTest and GoogleMock now require a minimum of C++17 support.
  - **Action:** Ensure your compiler and build configuration target C++17 or higher.
- **Mock Method Declarations:**
  - Continued enforcement of `MOCK_METHOD` macros for declaring mocks with explicit `(override)` specifiers.
  - **Tip:** Refer to the [Mocking Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/api-reference/mocking-apis/mock-methods.md) to update your mock classes accordingly.
- **Deprecations:**
  - Legacy `MOCK_METHODn` macros remain supported but migration to modern `MOCK_METHOD` is advised.

### Example Migration for Mock Methods

```cpp
// Old style:
MOCK_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// New style:
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int), (override));
```

- **Why migrate?**
  - Improved readability, better compiler diagnostics, and broader C++ standard compatibility.

### Removed or Changed Features

- **Removal of pre-C++17 support:**
  - If you rely on older C++ standards (C++11 or C++14), your builds will fail due to enforced minimum version checks.
- **Simplified flag handling:**
  - Build and runtime flags now assume C++17 features; older environment variables or compiler flags for feature toggling might be ignored.

## General Migration Tips

- **Review Deprecated APIs:**
  - Consult the [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/writing-basic-tests.md) and [Mocking Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/api-reference/mocking-apis/mock-methods.md) for updated usage patterns.

- **Update Your Build Environment:**
  - Adjust your `CMakeLists.txt` or Bazel BUILD files to target C++17 or later.
  - Confirm your compiler versions meet or exceed recommended minimums (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 7+, MSVC 2017 Update 3+).

- **Modernize Mock Declarations:**
  - Replace `MOCK_METHODn` macros with the modern `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
  - Explicitly specify method qualifiers like `(const, override)` as needed.

- **Use Newer Assertions and Matchers:**
  - Adapt to new or improved assertion macros, such as `EXPECT_THAT()` with powerful matchers described in the [Matchers Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/api-reference/core-apis/matchers.md).

- **Handle Exception and Death Tests Carefully:**
  - Review compatibility of death tests and exception assertions detailed in the [Advanced Testing Skills guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/advanced-testing-skills/death-and-exception-tests.md).

## Breaking Change Communication and Policy

- GoogleTest communicates breaking changes through the changelog, release notes, and dedicated migration documentation like this page.
- Backwards-incompatible changes are made only when necessary and typically coincide with major or minor version bumps.
- Users are encouraged to read release notes and upgrade guidance carefully when updating.

## Troubleshooting

- **Compilation errors related to C++ version:**
  - Confirm your compiler flags enforce C++17 or later.
- **Mock method conflicts or deprecation warnings:**
  - Review mock classes for old macro usage.
  - Ensure method signatures and qualifiers are consistent.
- **Unexpected test failures after upgrade:**
  - Use `--gmock_verbose=info` or `--gtest_break_on_failure` flags for detailed debugging.
