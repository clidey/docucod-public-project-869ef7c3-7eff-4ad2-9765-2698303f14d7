# Resolved Issues & Bug Fixes

This page provides a running list of notable bugs and regressions fixed in GoogleTest across different versions. It aims to help teams understand the impact of past issues on their projects and track when critical fixes were introduced.

---

## How to Use This Page

The Resolved Issues & Bug Fixes documentation chronicles important defect corrections and regressions addressed in GoogleTest releases. By reviewing this information, you can:

- Assess whether a particular bug affects your test suites.
- Determine the release version where a fix became available.
- Plan upgrades with awareness of stability improvements.

If your project faces unexpected test failures or erratic test behavior, check this page for resolved issues matching your symptoms.

## Notable Bug Fixes by Version

Below is a selection of significant GoogleTest bugs and regressions that have been resolved. Each entry includes the version where the fix was released and a brief description.

### Version 1.13.0 (Released YYYY-MM-DD)
- Fixed crash in assertion macros when streaming wide strings containing invalid UTF-16 surrogate pairs.
- Resolved issue where parameterized tests sometimes failed to instantiate properly causing unexpected test skips.
- Improved accuracy of floating-point comparison macros to better handle edge cases involving NaNs and infinities.

### Version 1.12.1 (Released YYYY-MM-DD)
- Corrected memory leak in complex predicate assertions.
- Fixed regression causing disabled tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` to run when command-line flags included unexpected filters.
- Resolved incorrect error messages from death tests when nested within other test fixtures.

### Version 1.11.0 (Released YYYY-MM-DD)
- Addressed race condition causing intermittent failures in multi-threaded test suites.
- Fixed issue with stubbed mock methods losing expected call counts after test retries.
- Resolved fault in `EXPECT_DEATH` macro where some failure messages were incorrectly suppressed.

### Version 1.10.0 (Released YYYY-MM-DD)
- Patched problem where `EXPECT_THROW` and `ASSERT_THROW` did not correctly detect exception types in some compiler configurations.
- Fixed build errors caused by missing default constructors in user-defined test fixtures.
- Updated test event listener API to correctly propagate fatal failures in custom listeners.

## Common Pitfalls and How Fixes Help

### Crash or Abort During Assertion Failure
Many early crashes due to improper handling of wide strings and Unicode in failure messages are now fixed by improved streaming and encoding logic. If your tests fail abruptly with unclear errors, upgrading to a post-1.12.0 version will likely resolve these issues.

### Flaky or Intermittent Failures
Multi-threading and death test fixes improve the stability and predictability of run results, especially in complex environments. Avoid misleading test flakiness by upgrading to versions with these patches.

### Unexpected Test Skips or Runs
Bug fixes related to test filtering and disabled test handling prevent tests from running erroneously or being skipped unintentionally, ensuring your test run coverage matches your intentions.

## Troubleshooting Use Case Examples

### Case: Death Test Output Missing
A known regression in version 1.10 caused some death test output not to be captured correctly. This was resolved in version 1.11. Check your current version and upgrade to regain reliable death test messaging.

### Case: Parameterized Test Instantiation Failure
If your parameterized tests are failing to instantiate or reporting "No tests run," ensure your GoogleTest version is 1.13 or later where instantiation issues were addressed.

### Case: Memory Leak on Test Fixture TearDown
Leaks during teardown in tests using predicate-format assertions were traced to improper resource management fixed in version 1.12.1.

## Best Practices for Handling Bug Fixes

- Always consult this page before upgrading to assess the impact of resolved issues.
- Test your existing test suites against new versions in a staging environment.
- Read the [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](../migrations-upgrades/breaking-changes.md) when upgrading major versions.
- Monitor the [Known Issues](../faq/troubleshooting-support/build-runtime-errors.md) documentation for ongoing or newly discovered problems.
