# Upgrade Process & Best Practices

This guide provides a clear, structured workflow for upgrading GoogleTest and GoogleMock in your projects with minimal friction and risks. It covers preparing your environment, handling dependency updates like Abseil integration, ensuring tooling compatibility, and validating your upgrade post-installation. Following these practices enables a smooth transition to newer versions while maintaining stability and test reliability.

---

## 1. Preparation Before Upgrade

Before initiating an upgrade, preparing your environment carefully mitigates common issues and streamlines the process.

- **Review Current Version and Changes:**
  - Identify your currently used version.
  - Consult the [release notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) for notable changes and breaking updates since your version.

- **Check System Requirements:**
  - The latest GoogleTest requires at least **C++17** support from your compiler.
  - Ensure your build tools (e.g., CMake, Bazel) are up to date and compatible.
  - Verify platform support, referencing the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md).

- **Assess Dependencies:**
  - GoogleTest plans to take a dependency on [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp); prepare to accommodate this if integrated.
  - Verify if your project or tooling relies on version-specific functionality of GoogleTest or GoogleMock.

- **Backup Critical Artifacts:**
  - Backup your existing GoogleTest and GoogleMock directories.
  - Save your current test binaries and configuration files.

## 2. Upgrade Workflow Step-by-Step

Upgrade your GoogleTest environment by following these ordered steps to ensure a smooth transition.

### Step 1: Pull Latest Version

- Clone or pull the latest GoogleTest repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
git checkout main
```

- Alternatively, update your package manager or dependency version to the latest release tag.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Build System

- Update build scripts to comply with current GoogleTest standards.
  - For CMake, verify your `CMakeLists.txt` includes the correct targets for `gtest` and `gmock`.
  - If using the new `gmock_main` target with main function:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
add_executable(my_test test_suite.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test GTest::gmock_main)
```

- Incorporate any new flags or definitions, such as enabling C++17.

- If your project is modularized, ensure GoogleMock and GoogleTest targets are linked consistently.

### Step 3: Update Dependencies

- If taking the newly introduced dependency on Abseil:
  - Add Abseil to your build configuration.
  - Include Abseil's headers and libraries in your project.
  - Sync versions to avoid conflicts.

- Check for thread support and platform-specific flags:
  - GoogleTest's internal macros (e.g., `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) automatically detect threading capability but verify your environment.

---

## 3. Tooling and Compatibility Considerations

To ensure your upgraded environment behaves as expected, address these critical tooling compatibility points.

- **Compiler Compatibility:**
  - Confirm your compiler fully supports C++17, as the minimum requirement.
  - Address any issue related to RTTI, exceptions, or threading flags.

- **Build Tools:**
  - Update your CMake/Bazel versions where necessary to handle newer GoogleTest build requirements.
  - Ensure the build system properly sets macro flags such as `GTEST_HAS_ABSL`, if applicable.

- **Linking and Binary Compatibility:**
  - If you previously used static libraries without the `main()` function from `gmock`, consider switching to `gmock_main` if convenient.
  - Pay attention to platform-specific main function entry points (e.g., Windows vs. Linux).

- **API Changes and Macro Usage:**
  - If you previously used old-style mocking macros such as `MOCK_METHODn`, migrate to the unified `MOCK_METHOD` macro as recommended.

---

## 4. Post-Upgrade Validation

After upgrading, it's essential to validate your test suite and integration points to confirm stability.

- **Rebuild Tests:**
  - Clean and rebuild your entire test suite.
  - Confirm no compilation errors or warnings specific to GoogleTest/GoogleMock.

- **Run Tests:**
  - Execute your tests in multiple configurations if applicable.
  - Verify that all tests pass and unexpected failures or warnings are resolved.

- **Test Output and Logging:**
  - Confirm that detailed logs and stack traces output as expected.
  - Use flags such as `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug mock interactions if necessary.

- **Inspect Mock Behavior:**
  - Review usage of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers to control uninteresting call behaviors.
  - Adjust expectations to handle any changes in mocking semantics.

- **Regression Monitoring:**
  - Run critical tests repeatedly over some time to catch intermittent issues.
  - Incorporate test coverage tools to ensure all areas behave as expected.

## 5. Best Practices for Sustainable Upgrades

To keep your testing dependencies healthy and minimize upgrade pains in the future, adopt the following best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated Regularly:** Frequent smaller upgrades reduce the complexity and risk compared to large version jumps.

- **Maintain Clear Mock Definitions:** Use the latest `MOCK_METHOD` style macros consistently for clarity and supportability.

- **Adopt Interaction-Based Testing Thoughtfully:** Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` for precise interaction verifications to minimize test brittleness.

- **Use Build System Modern Features:** Leverage targets like `GTest::gmock_main` in CMake to simplify linking and maintenance.

- **Employ CI Integration for Early Detection:** Automate builds and tests with your CI to catch regressions early after upgrades.

- **Monitor Platform Specifics:** Regularly review platform compatibility matrices and platform detection macros to anticipate portability issues.

- **Test Mock Behavior Variants:** Use `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` to control warnings and errors from unexpected mock calls appropriate to your test suite stability level.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Compilation Failures
- Verify compiler version supports C++17.
- Check for missing dependencies or include directories.
- Replace any deprecated or removed MOCK_METHODn macros with `MOCK_METHOD`.

### Linker Errors
- Confirm that you link against the correct GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- For Windows, ensure you address known platform entry point issues as documented.
- Use `gmock_main` if you prefer GoogleMock to provide `main()`.

### Runtime Test Failures
- Confirm no API changes in GoogleTest/GoogleMock are breaking your test expectations.
- Increase verbosity using `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain detailed insight.

### Deprecated or Removed Features
- Refer to the [Deprecations & Removals](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/changelog/upgrade-guides/deprecations-and-removals.md) page for guidance on migrating away from outdated APIs.
