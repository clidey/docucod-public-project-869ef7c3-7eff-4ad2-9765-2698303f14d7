# Platform & Toolchain Updates

Ensure your development environment aligns with the latest supported platforms, compilers, and build tools to maintain compatibility, security, and performance when using GoogleTest. This page provides a comprehensive overview of changes, additions, and removals regarding platform and toolchain support that impact how you build and run your tests.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest continuously evolves to stay aligned with modern development environments. This document focuses exclusively on updates related to:

- Supported operating systems
- Compiler versions and compatibility
- Build toolchain additions and removals

Staying informed about these updates helps you ensure your environment remains compatible with the latest GoogleTest versions and benefits from security patches and build stability improvements.

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a broad range of operating systems, documented through adherence to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). The following platforms are recognized and integrated into GoogleTest's build and runtime configurations:

- Windows (including Windows Desktop and MinGW)
- Linux and Linux-based derivatives (including Android)
- macOS and iOS
- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- QNX
- Fuchsia (currently not officially supported but recognized in builds)
- Cygwin
- Solaris
- AIX
- GNU/Hurd

Additional details and version-specific compatibility can be consulted in the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation.

## Compiler and Build Toolchain Support

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17-compliant compiler. Updates have introduced or deprecated support for specific compiler versions or flags:

### Compiler Compatibility

- C++17 Standard is mandated for all GoogleTest builds.
- MSVC: Requires Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later for full compatibility.
- GCC: Recommended versions are 7.0 and higher.
- Clang: Supported versions align with the C++17 standard and platform capabilities.

GoogleTest's internal Bazel build supports detecting compiler types and versions, including specialized compiler flags:

- MSVC Compiler detection via Bazel (`msvc-cl` flag) ensures Windows environments build correctly with Microsoft compilers.
- Support for POSIX and non-POSIX environments is managed internally for flexible compilation.

### Build Tools

GoogleTest supports both Bazel and CMake as primary build systems:

- **Bazel**: The `BUILD.bazel` configuration detects various platforms and compiler attributes to adapt build options accordingly. It handles platform-specific compile options, link flags, and dependencies (e.g., Abseil and RE2 integration).
  - Bazelâ€™s configuration recognizes platforms like QNX, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Fuchsia.
  - Special compile and link options are applied based on platform.

- **CMake**: Includes scripts to detect compiler features, set build flags, and manage shared/static library linking options.
  - Enables building GoogleTest as a shared or static library.
  - Supports detailed configuration of compiler flags for MSVC, Clang, GCC, and others.

### Important Notes

- Fuchsia is currently detected but remains an unsupported platform for production use.
- Certain platform-specific libraries and dependencies (such as Abseil and RE2) are conditionally included based on compiler flags.
- Multi-threading support is conditional on platform capabilities and compiler threading support.

## Practical Implications for Users

### Keeping Environments Supported

To avoid build or runtime issues:

- Ensure your compiler meets the minimum C++17 and platform specification requirements.
- Align build system commands with the recommended configurations (e.g., use provided CMakeLists or Bazel BUILD files).
- When upgrading GoogleTest, check this page and the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) for any new platform or compiler support changes.

### Security and Stability

Platform and toolchain updates may include critical security improvements or fixes to prevent build-time and runtime vulnerabilities. Adhering to supported versions guarantees you receive security patches.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors related to platform or compiler incompatibilities:

- Verify your compiler version and platform against the supported matrix.
- Check for missing or incorrect compiler flags.
- Review whether conditional dependencies like Abseil or RE2 are correctly integrated.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/troubleshooting-resources/troubleshooting-common-issues.md) guide for resolutions.

<Tip>
Staying current with platform and toolchain updates ensures your tests compile without errors and run reliably across environments.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using unsupported platforms or outdated compilers is likely to cause build failures or undefined behavior at runtime.
</Warning>
