## Semantic Versioning Explained

GoogleTest employs a semantic versioning scheme `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`:

- **Major versions** introduce backward-incompatible changes requiring deliberate migration.
- **Minor versions** add backward-compatible functionality and enhancements.
- **Patch versions** contain backward-compatible bug fixes and minor improvements.

Regular patch releases ensure stability and responsiveness to user feedback.
