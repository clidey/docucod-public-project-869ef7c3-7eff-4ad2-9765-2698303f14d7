## 1. Overview of the Latest Release

**Current Version: 1.17.0**

The 1.17.x branch marks a significant milestone in GoogleTest’s evolution by requiring a minimum of C++17 support. This change modernizes the codebase and enables powerful language features, improving performance and maintainability.

### Headline Features & Improvements

- **C++17 Minimum Standard Requirement**: Ensures compatibility with modern compilers and leverages updated language capabilities.
- **Enhanced CI Integration**: Built using Google’s internal continuous integration systems, guaranteeing reliability and consistency in builds and tests.
- **Consolidation of GoogleTest and GoogleMock**: Releasing as a single unified framework simplifies dependency management and streamlines test creation for users.
- **Documentation on GitHub Pages**: Full documentation is conveniently hosted at [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/), making navigation and reference easier than ever.

### Benefits to Users

By adopting version 1.17.0, users gain improved language support, a polished overall experience, and better alignment with contemporary C++ practices that enhance test writing and execution efficiency.

## 2. What’s New

### Modernized Language Support
- Requires your compiler to support at least the C++17 standard, ensuring you have access to the latest language improvements that GoogleTest depends on.

### Streamlined Framework Delivery
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock are now jointly maintained and released from the same repository, so you get consistent versions and integrated behavior out-of-the-box.

### Upgraded Build & CI System
- Internal Google CI systems validate the framework continuously, translating into more stable releases and faster identification of issues.

---

## 3. Upgrade and Compatibility Notes

### Minimum Compiler Standard
- If you are upgrading from an earlier GoogleTest version, verify that your project compiler flags set the C++ language standard to at least C++17.

### Migration Impact
- The API surface remains consistent to maintain backward compatibility, but the underlying code modernization may affect projects with custom patched versions or deep internal integrations.

### Documentation Access
- We highly recommend reviewing the updated official documentation on GitHub Pages for the latest usage patterns and integration guidance: [GoogleTest Documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/)
