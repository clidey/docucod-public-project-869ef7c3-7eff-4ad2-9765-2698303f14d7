## What's New in This Release

### Key Features and Enhancements

- **Improved C++17 Support Requirement**
  - The release enforces a minimum requirement of C++17, ensuring better compatibility and leveraging modern language features for improved robustness and maintainability.

- **Dependency Considerations**
  - Upcoming plans to introduce a dependency on the Abseil library are acknowledged. This sets the stage for future releases that will harness Abseil’s utilities for enhanced performance and code clarity.

- **Unified GoogleTest & GoogleMock Distribution**
  - The package continues combining GoogleTest and GoogleMock into a single repository and release, consolidating your testing and mocking needs in one place.

- **Rich Assertion Macros and Death Tests Support**
  - Continued refinement of various assertion types, including fatal and non-fatal assertions, predicate assertions, and death tests (code expected to cause process termination), offering precise failure diagnostics.

- **Automatic Test Discovery and Execution Improvements**
  - Enhancements have been applied to test discovery mechanisms, streamlining how your tests are located and executed without manual registration.

- **Value- and Type-Parameterized Tests Updates**
  - Support for advanced value-parameterized and typed tests allows concise, reusable tests across multiple data values and types, improving test coverage efficiently.

### Notable Fixes and Resolutions

- **Build System Stability**
  - Improvements to CMake and Bazel build instructions ensure smoother setup and integration into existing C++ projects.

- **Platform Compatibility Assurance**
  - Adjustments have been made to official supported platforms and compiler compatibility, maintaining broad multi-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS).

- **Mock Object Macro Fixes**
  - Addressed issues tied to mock method declarations and matching behaviors, resolving edge cases that could cause unexpected failures during mock expectations.

- **Test Failure Reporting and Status Codes**
  - Enhanced clarity and accuracy in representing test failure details, improving integration with CI pipelines and debugging workflows.

### Upgrade Recommendations

- Users must ensure their projects are configured for C++17 or higher to use this release.
- Review current usages of mock macros to align with improved mock expectation handling.
- Verify your build system configurations with updated CMake/Bazel guidelines to avoid linking or discovery issues.
