# Upgrade Best Practices

GoogleTest continuously evolves to provide better stability, feature enhancements, and broader platform support. Upgrading to the latest version ensures you benefit from these improvements, but requires careful planning to avoid integration issues and maintain test reliability.

This guide offers pragmatic, step-by-step recommendations for upgrading GoogleTest. It focuses solely on best practices that help individuals and teams transition smoothly, with minimal disruption.

---

## 1. Understand Your Current Setup

Before beginning any upgrade:

- **Identify your current GoogleTest version.**
- **Review your build and runtime environment.** Ensure compatibility with requirements of the latest release, such as C++17 compiler support.
- **Check which components you use:** Many also use GoogleMock (gMock), so upgrading both in tandem is often necessary.

For version details, consult the [Releases Overview](/changelog/version-history/releases-overview).

---

## 2. Review Release Notes Thoroughly

Each release may introduce new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes. It is critical to:

- Read the [Release Highlights](/changelog/version-history/notable-features-improvements) for new capabilities.
- Examine known breaking changes and migration notes in detail [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](/changelog/migration-guides/breaking-changes).
- Review deprecation warnings and plan for removal timelines from [Deprecation Notices & Scheduled Removals](/changelog/maintenance-fixes/deprecation-notices).

---

## 3. Prepare Your Development Environment

Make sure your environment meets the minimum system requirements for the new version:

- Use a compiler with C++17 support or newer.
- Ensure your build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel) is compatible.
- Update dependencies related to GoogleTest if necessary.
- Validate platform support against the [Supported Platforms & Dependencies](/overview/integration-and-ecosystem/platforms-dependencies).

Tip: Using continuous integration (CI) pipelines can help catch environment-specific issues early.

## 4. Upgrade Steps

### 4.1. Source Update

- Fetch the latest release from the official [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- Update your vendor directory or package manager configuration accordingly.

### 4.2. Rebuild Framework

- Fully clean and rebuild GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Verify that these updated libraries link correctly to your test binaries.

### 4.3. Build Your Tests

- Rebuild your test suites with the upgraded libraries.
- Watch for compiler errors caused by newly introduced API changes or stricter checks.

---

## 5. Validate Your Tests

After upgrading:

- Run all existing tests to verify they pass with the new framework.
- Look out for new warnings or test failures.
- Check output format changes, if any, especially if your CI or reporting tools parse these.
- Verify integration with related tools for coverage, reporting, and IDE support.

If you encounter failures or unexpected behaviors, consult:

- [Basic Usage & Troubleshooting FAQ](/faq/getting-started-faq/basic-usage-troubleshooting)
- [Mocking Edge Cases & Pitfalls FAQ](/faq/advanced-usage-faq/mocking-pitfalls)

---

## 6. Modify Code to Address Breaking Changes

Where breaking changes are unavoidable:

- Follow the migration instructions provided in the [Breaking Changes & Migration Notes](/changelog/migration-guides/breaking-changes).
- Adjust test fixtures, mocks, and assertions in your code as necessary.
- Consider using compatibility shims or conditional compilation if supporting multiple GoogleTest versions.

---

## 7. Optimize Tests Using New Features

Explore newer versions' feature improvements to enhance your tests:

- Utilize advanced parameterized test capabilities.
- Benefit from improved matchers and assertions.
- Configure mock behavior modes (Nice, Naggy, Strict) for better test reliability.
- Implement more concise custom matchers and actions where needed.

Refer to [Feature Overview](/overview/getting-started-intro/feature-overview) and the [Mocking Cookbook](/docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for hands-on examples.

---

## 8. Update CI and Tooling Integrations

- Update build scripts and test runners to align with upgraded GoogleTest.
- Ensure reporting and output parsing tools are compatible with any output format changes.
- Validate that IDE plugins or integrations recognize the updated framework.

See the [CI/CD Integration Guide](/guides/integration-and-realworld/ci-cd-integration) and [Ecosystem Integrations](/overview/integration-and-ecosystem/ecosystem-integrations) documents.

---

## 9. Manage Rollbacks and Versioning

In case you encounter critical issues:

- Keep the previous GoogleTest version accessible for quick rollback.
- Communicate upgrade plans clearly to your team.
- Use feature branches or separate integration branches to test upgrades before merging.

Refer to the [Releases Overview](/changelog/version-history/releases-overview) for stable release and support policy information.

---

## 10. Best Practices to Avoid Upgrade Pitfalls

- **Avoid underspecified mock expectations.** Use `ON_CALL` appropriately to set default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only to verify interactions.
- **Prefer test fixtures over global state** to prevent contamination during parallel or iterative test runs.
- **Keep test names free of underscores `_`** to prevent internal naming conflicts as specified in the [GoogleTest FAQ](/docs/faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore).
- **Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for clearer assertions.**
- **Be cautious with death tests,** understanding their subprocess model to avoid flaky results.
