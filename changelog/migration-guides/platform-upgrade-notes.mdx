# Platform & Compatibility Updates

GoogleTest evolves alongside advancements in C++ compilers, platforms, and build environments to ensure reliable and maintainable unit testing experiences. This page details the history of supported compilers, operating systems, and build tools over time, and offers guidance for developers to adapt their projects when changes impact compatibility.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), requiring a minimum of C++17 support from compilers. This ensures modern language features and improved safety throughout the test framework.

### Key Compiler and Platform Requirements
- **C++ Standard:** Minimum C++17 support is mandatory for all supported releases.
- **Compiler Versions:**
  - MSVC 2015 (Visual Studio 14.0) or later
  - GCC 7.x or later
  - Clang with C++17 support
- **Operating Systems:**
  - Linux distributions
  - Windows (including Windows 10 and Windows Server versions supported by MSVC 2015+)
  - macOS (modern supported versions compatible with Clang)
  - BSD variants
  - Embedded platforms with appropriate compiler support

### Build Tool Requirements
- **CMake:** Minimum recommended version 3.14 or newer for full feature compatibility
- **Bazel:** Fully supported with workspace and dependency management for test binaries

### Threading and Runtime Considerations
GoogleTest depends on pthread where available for thread safety. On Windows, run-time library linkage should be consistent between GoogleTest and your projects to avoid conflicts.

## 2. Evolution of Platform Support

Over time, GoogleTest has refined its baseline platform compatibility to align with modern development environments, improving performance and maintainability.

### Historical Changes
- **C++17 enforcement:** Starting with version 1.17.x, GoogleTest requires C++17, discontinuing support for older standards to leverage up-to-date language features.
- **Compiler support updates:** Older compiler versions (e.g., MSVC prior to 2015, GCC earlier than 7) are no longer supported. This allows the project to focus on recent and actively maintained toolchains.
- **Deprecated platform handling:** Certain legacy platforms and compilers have been phased out to streamline code maintenance and improve static analysis capabilities.

### Impact on Users
If your development environment relies on deprecated platforms or older compilers, upgrading to compliant toolchains is necessary to use recent GoogleTest versions. This ensures compatibility and access to new features and bug fixes.

## 3. Responding to Platform Changes

When updating GoogleTest in your projects, consider the following steps to address platform and compatibility updates effectively.

### Step-by-Step Adaptation Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Compiler Compliance">
Check that your compiler meets the minimum C++17 standard and version requirements before upgrading GoogleTest. On Linux, run `g++ --version` or `clang++ --version` to verify.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Build Toolchains">
Upgrade your build tools such as CMake or Bazel to supported versions described above. For CMake, ensure version 3.14+ supports commands like `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()` which GoogleTest uses.
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Runtime Linkage on Windows">
On Windows platforms using MSVC, match your project’s runtime (static vs dynamic) with GoogleTest using the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to avoid linkage errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Deprecated Platform Support">
If your project targets older or unsupported platforms, consider maintaining legacy GoogleTest versions or upgrading your platform/compilers to continue receiving updates.
</Step>
<Step title="Consult Migration Guides">
Refer to the [Breaking Changes & Required Migrations](/changelog/migration-guides/breaking-changes) documentation for detailed migration steps if upgrading across major versions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Common Issues and Workarounds

### 4.1 Build Failures due to Compiler Incompatibility
- **Symptom:** Compiler errors related to C++17 features or build scripts.
- **Resolution:** Confirm your compiler supports C++17. Consider upgrading your compiler or temporarily using an older GoogleTest release compatible with your toolchain.

### 4.2 Runtime Linker Conflicts on Windows
- **Symptom:** Linker errors or runtime mismatches indicating conflicting CRT linkage.
- **Resolution:** Enable the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` when building GoogleTest to match dynamic CRT linkage used by your project.

### 4.3 Deprecated Platform Macros
- **Symptom:** Build warnings or errors due to removed or changed platform-specific macros.
- **Resolution:** Update your code to remove dependencies on deprecated macros and follow standard platform detection techniques.

### Troubleshooting Resources
Consult the [Build & Compilation Errors](../faq/troubleshooting/faq-build-errors) and [Environment & Platform Issues](../getting-started/common-issues-and-troubleshooting/environment-setup-problems) guides for detailed diagnostics and resolutions.

## 5. Best Practices for Compatibility

- Always use the latest stable compiler versions that support C++17 or newer.
- Regularly update your build tools to align with GoogleTest requirements.
- Consistently match runtime library linkage settings between your projects and GoogleTest to avoid conflicts.
- Monitor GoogleTest’s release notes and migration guides for upcoming compatibility changes.
- Engage with community support channels if facing unusual platform issues ([Getting Help and Report Issues](/faq/help-community/faq-getting-help)).
