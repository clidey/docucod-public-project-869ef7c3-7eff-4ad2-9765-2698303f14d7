# Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements

This page summarizes the bug fixes and reliability enhancements made in each GoogleTest and GoogleMock release. It is designed for teams aiming to resolve specific known issues or verify that problems encountered previously have been addressed, ensuring more robust and stable test suites.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock prioritize maximizing framework stability and correctness. Each release addresses user-submitted bugs, fixes corner case errors, and improves internal robustness, often leading to clearer error messages, reduced false negatives, and better integration with build systems.

This page focuses on changes that improve product reliability and bug resolution, distinct from feature additions or breaking API changes. It helps maintainers and developers track fixes pertinent to their test environment and decide on upgrading to benefit from these improvements.

## Recent Bug Fixes Highlights

### Improved Test Discovery and Execution
- Fixed issues related to test cases and test names containing underscores leading to ambiguous test class generation, preventing subtle and platform-dependent failures.
- Resolved problems where death tests occasionally hung or failed due to threading and subprocess interactions, improving reliability in parallel and multithreaded environments.

### Assertion and Matcher Reliability
- Enhanced diagnostic messages for predicate assertions and matchers to better indicate causes of failure, aiding users in debugging complex test scenarios.
- Fixed cases where `EXPECT_EQ(NULL, ptr)` worked differently than `EXPECT_NE(NULL, ptr)`, clarifying pointer comparison behaviors and encouraging `nullptr` usage.

### Mocking Consistency and Usability
- Addressed situations where mock method calls without expectations caused unclear warnings or false failures, refining the default strictness and message clarity.
- Improved handling of overloaded methods and mocking move-only types, reducing compilation errors and unexpected runtime behavior.
- Resolved bugs in expectation ordering and call sequences, ensuring expectations are honored correctly in complex mock interactions.

### Build and Integration Stability
- Fixed build and linking problems on various platforms mainly related to compiler flags and dependency mismatches.
- Optimized integration with CMake and Bazel build systems to reduce common setup issues.

## How to Benefit from Bug Fixes

- **Upgrade promptly:** Regularly update to the latest GoogleTest release to incorporate stability improvements.
- **Check release notes:** Review [Version Release Notes](../changelog/release-history/version-list) for detailed information on fixes and resolve specific issues.
- **Adjust test naming:** Avoid underscores `_` in test suite or test names to ensure test discovery functions consistently across compiler versions.
- **Use recommended assertion patterns:** Prefer `nullptr` over `NULL` in pointer assertions for better compatibility.
- **Manage mock strictness wisely:** Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers appropriately to control warnings and enforcement on uninteresting calls.

## Troubleshooting Common Problems Addressed

- **Tests not discovered or running:** Underscore usage and improper fixture setup can interfere with test registration.
- **Death tests hanging or failing intermittently:** Follow guidance on death test styles and thread-safe execution available in the advanced topics.
- **Unclear mock call failures:** Increase verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace matching and expectations.
- **Build and setup errors:** Verify environment prerequisites and follow detailed installation instructions.

## Best Practices Following Fixes

- Follow naming conventions strictly to prevent reserved identifier conflicts.
- Leverage `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` correctly to separate mock default behaviors from expected interactions.
- Use enhanced assertions and matchers from recent releases for clearer test validation.
- Utilize provided debugging flags and event listeners to gain insight into test failures and flaky behaviors.
