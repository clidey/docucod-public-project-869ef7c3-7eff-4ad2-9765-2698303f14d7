# Bug Fixes & Patches

GoogleTest's commitment to reliability and robustness is reflected in a comprehensive record of resolved issues, bug fixes, and patches delivered across releases. This page consolidates information on key defects addressed to help users evaluate when to update their versions and understand improvements made to the framework.

## Recent Bug Fixes

### Assertion Accuracy and Reporting

- Fixed scenarios where certain assertion failure messages were unclear or incomplete, especially when comparing pointers or complex user-defined types.
- Resolved issues with `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_EQ` to correctly display values and expressions when assertions fail, aiding in faster diagnosis.
- Improved the detection and reporting of non-fatal vs. fatal failures to ensure test flows behave as intended.

### Thread Safety Enhancements

- Addressed concurrency issues involving `SCOPED_TRACE()` used in multi-threaded test cases to prevent trace leakage across threads.
- Updated synchronization primitives for thread-safe test execution on supported platforms, reducing race conditions in failure reporting.
- Corrected edge cases in the handling of test failures occurring in sub-threads, especially with `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` and related macros that previously ignored failures outside the current thread.

### Test Registration and Execution

- Fixed subtle bugs in dynamic test registration APIs (`RegisterTest`) that caused incorrect fixture associations or test suite inconsistencies.
- Corrected naming conflicts and macro usage constraints that caused compilation errors when mixing different test macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`) within the same suite.
- Rectified issues where disabled tests might inadvertently run or cause the setup/teardown methods to execute unexpectedly.

### Command Line Flags and Environment Parsing

- Improved robustness of command line flag parsing, especially to correctly handle duplicated flags, malformed inputs, or integration with Abseil's flag handling.
- Patched parsing logic for flags like `--gtest_filter`, `--gtest_repeat`, and `--gtest_shuffle` to better align with expected filtering and repetition behavior.

### Output and Reporting

- Ensured special characters in failure messages (such as embedded NULs, newlines, and reserved XML characters) are properly escaped in console and XML output.
- Fixed bugs in XML and JSON report generation to correctly record test properties and avoid duplicate or incorrect entries.
- Resolved issues with record properties to prevent conflicts with reserved keys and ensure proper logging during test suite setup and teardown.

### Death Tests and Exception Safety

- Enhanced detection and behavior of death tests to handle exceptions and process exits reliably across platforms including Linux and Windows.
- Corrected misuse of fatal assertions inside non-void functions, constructors, or destructors which previously produced confusing compile errors or incorrect test results.

### Printing and Debugging

- Improved GoogleTest's internal support for user-defined type printing via `AbslStringify()` and `PrintTo()` overloads, providing more informative failure diagnostics for custom types.
- Fixed issues where streaming user-defined types into assertion messages failed or produced truncated outputs.

## Notable Patches

- **Multi-threaded Scoped Traces:** Concurrent uses of `SCOPED_TRACE()` now correctly associate failure traces with the respective threads without interfering with one another.

- **Predicate Assertion Evaluation:** Ensured arguments to predicate assertions (`EXPECT_PRED*`) are evaluated exactly once and messages display consistent, useful info on success or failure.

- **Test Property Management:** Duplicate test property keys are now overridden cleanly without creating conflicting states or test report inconsistencies.

- **Flag Parsing for Sharding:** Reliable enabling and disabling of test sharding via environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` with proper validation of inputs.

- **Death Test Timeout Fix:** Addressed potential hangs or improper child process handling in death tests using the "threadsafe" style on Linux systems.

## Applying Bug Fixes

To benefit from these bug fixes and patches, users are advised to:

- Upgrade to the latest stable release version when possible.
- Review the [Version History & Roadmap](release-highlights/version-history) for detailed release notes and understanding of upgrade impacts.
- Follow the [Breaking Changes](breaks-deprecations/breaking-changes) documentation before upgrading major versions to adapt tests to any altered behavior.
- Consult the [FAQ](usage-troubleshooting/assertion-errors-explained) for common diagnostics and test failure interpretation.

---

## Reporting Issues

For issues not yet fixed or requiring further attention, users are encouraged to:

- File detailed bug reports on the official [GoogleTest GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- Include minimal reproducible code snippets and context to aid maintainers in quick resolution.
- Engage with the community and maintainers through discussion threads for clarification or workarounds.

```cpp
// Example of catching fatal failures in a subroutine
void TestEq1(int x) { ASSERT_EQ(1, x); }

void TryTestSubroutine() {
  TestEq1(2); // Will generate a fatal failure
  if (testing::Test::HasFatalFailure()) return; // Exit early on failure
  // This line will not be reached if fatal failure occurs
  FAIL() << "This should never be reached.";
}
```


<Tip>
Upgrading regularly ensures you benefit from ongoing bug fixes, improved stability, and new features while minimizing frustration from known issues.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not ignore fatal assertion failures in subroutines; failure to check may cause undefined behavior or crashes during tests.
</Warning>

<Info>
Ensure test environment and build configurations are compatible with the GoogleTest version you upgrade to by consulting the Supported Platforms & Compatibility documentation.
