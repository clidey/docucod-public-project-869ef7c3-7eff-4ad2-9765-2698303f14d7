# Breaking Changes by Release

Explore a concise and targeted summary of breaking changes introduced in each release of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page helps you understand which API or behavioral modifications require your attention to avoid integration pitfalls and ensure smooth upgrades.

---

## Why This Matters

When upgrading GoogleTest or GoogleMock versions, encountering unexpected breaking changes can disrupt your test suites, cause compilation errors, or lead to subtle test failures. This page surfaces those critical changes up front, saving integration effort and reducing surprises.

## How to Use This Page

Each entry below corresponds to a released version and provides:

- What changed in the API or behavior
- Why this change was necessary
- How you can adjust your code or test suites

Focus your migration and testing effort on these key points to maintain compatibility and test reliability.

## Breaking Changes Summary

<AccordionGroup title="Breaking Changes by Version">
<Accordion title="Version 1.14.0 - March 2024">
### Overview
- Introduced stricter matching rules for `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` when dealing with overloaded methods.
- Deprecated legacy `MOCK_CONST_METHODn` macros in favor of unified `MOCK_METHOD` with const qualifier.

### What Changed
- Overloaded mock methods now require explicit disambiguation to prevent ambiguous calls.
- Using legacy macros like `MOCK_CONST_METHOD1` triggers deprecation warnings.

### Why
- Improves type safety and clarity in expectations.
- Simplifies and unifies the mocking methodology.

### Migration Tips
- Add explicit qualifiers or use `Const()` wrapper when matching overloaded const methods.
- Refactor mock classes to replace legacy macros with the current `MOCK_METHOD` syntax.

---
### Example
```cpp
// Old
MOCK_CONST_METHOD1(Foo, bool(int));

// New
MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int), (const, override));

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Const(SomeMatcher)));
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Version 1.13.0 - December 2023">
### Overview
- Changes to default behavior for handling uninteresting mock function calls.

### What Changed
- The default message verbosity for warnings on uninteresting calls was updated.

### Why
- To balance noise and useful diagnostics.

### Migration Tips
- Users relying on quiet test output may need to adjust `--gmock_verbose` flag accordingly.
- Consider switching to `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers to control warning behavior explicitly.

---
### Example
```bash
// To suppress warnings:
--gmock_verbose=error

// To enable detailed info:
--gmock_verbose=info
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Version 1.12.0 - September 2023">
### Overview
- Modified behavior for expectation stickiness and saturation.

### What Changed
- Expectations marked with `Times(n)` without `RetiresOnSaturation()` now remain active after saturation, possibly causing unexpected failures.

### Why
- To enable repetitive verification without unexpected match loss.

### Migration Tips
- Add `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to expectations that should deactivate when saturated.
- Review test cases that rely on multiple calls to the same expectations.

---
### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo())
    .Times(3)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();  // Ensures the expectation retires after 3 calls
```
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Missing Overrides Causing Compilation Errors
- Ensure all overridden virtual methods in mock classes include the `override` specifier.
- Use `MOCK_METHOD` syntax anticipating qualifiers like `(const, override)`.

### Unexpected Warnings of Uninteresting Calls
- Define default behaviors via `ON_CALL` for methods without strict expectations.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress such warnings globally for a mock.

### Overloaded Methods Ambiguity
- When mocking overloaded methods, provide explicit type disambiguation (see `Const()` or argument matchers).

## Best Practices for Managing Breaking Changes

- Review breaking changes in each release before upgrading your dependency version.
- Refactor test mocks progressively to use modern macros and APIs.
- Use sequences and `.RetiresOnSaturation()` clauses to manage expectations lifecycle reliably.
- Control verbosity levels with `--gmock_verbose` and mock wrappers to balance diagnostic output.
