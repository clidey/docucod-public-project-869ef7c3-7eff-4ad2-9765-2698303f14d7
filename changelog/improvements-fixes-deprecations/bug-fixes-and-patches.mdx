# Bug Fixes and Patches

This page catalogs the resolved defects and minor maintenance updates in GoogleTest and GoogleMock that impact your test reliability, stability, or performance. It enables you to track fixes that improve the robustness of your testing workflows without introducing new features or API changes.

## Understanding Bug Fixes and Patches

Resolving bugs in test frameworks is crucial for ensuring your tests behave as expected and do not fail unpredictably. This section describes typical areas addressed in bug fixes and how these patches improve your experience with GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- **Test Reliability Improvements**: Fixes that prevent flaky or spurious test failures caused by corner-case bugs in the framework.
- **Stability Enhancements**: Patches that prevent crashes or undefined behavior during mocking, test execution, or initialization.
- **Performance Corrections**: Updates that improve the execution speed or memory usage without changing test semantics.

Maintaining awareness of these fixes helps you decide when to upgrade to newer patch versions and know what issues have been resolved.

## Recent Bug Fixes Highlights

Although this page deals specifically with bug fixes and patch releases, understanding what kinds of fixes are included assists users in maintaining stable testing environments. Recent fixes cover:

- **Mocking Behavior Corrections:** Adjustments to mocking mechanisms to handle edge cases such as overloaded methods, move-only types, or complex matcher interactions to prevent test failures or memory issues.

- **Assertion Framework Corrections:** Fixes to improve the robustness of assertion macros, including better diagnostics and correct reporting of failure conditions.

- **Test Discovery and Execution Stability:** Patches that ensure tests are properly discovered, registered, and run, reducing failures due to configuration or environment changes.

- **Multi-threading Safety:** Fixes in managing concurrent mock invocations and global state to avoid race conditions causing intermittent failures.

## Practical Impact and User Guidance

By applying the bug fixes covered here, you can expect:

- Fewer unexpected test failures unrelated to your code changes.
- Clearer error messages and failure diagnostics when real test failures occur.
- Improved compatibility with supported platforms and compilers.
- Increased confidence in mock object behavior, especially when using complex expectations or default actions.

### Best Practices After Applying Fixes

- **Review Release Notes:** Always consult the linked full release notes to understand the scope and any indirect impact.
- **Verify Test Suites:** After upgrading, run your full test suite to verify that no regressions have been introduced.
- **Control Mock Expectations Strictly:** Use the provided mechanisms (e.g., `RetiresOnSaturation()`, `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) to manage strictness and verbosity after patches.
- **Leverage ON_CALL Wisely:** Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behavior settings and only use `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to assert calls, as explained in the related [Mocking and Expectations Guide](/guides/core-testing-workflows/mocking-and-expectations) and [Mocking Reference](/docs/reference/mocking.md).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter unexpected test failures or flaky behavior, consider the following tips:

- Run tests with increased verbosity using the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces of mock method calls and expectation matches.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/running-first-test/troubleshooting-setup) guide to diagnose setup and environment-related problems.
- Validate your environment according to the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-basics/prerequisites-requirements).
- Verify that mock classes use the correct `MOCK_METHOD` syntax, as detailed in the [Mocking Reference](/docs/reference/mocking.md#MOCK_METHOD).

## How to Stay Updated on Bug Fixes

- Check the [Full Version History](/changelog/version-history-and-highlights/full-version-history) regularly for detailed entries about fixes.
- Review the [Latest Release Summary](/changelog/version-history-and-highlights/latest-release-summary) for highlights.
- Read about breaking changes and migration advice in the [Breaking Changes](/changelog/breaking-changes-and-migration/breaking-changes) and [Migration FAQ](/changelog/breaking-changes-and-migration/migration-faq) pages.

<Check>
Ensure your test environment meets the latest platform and compiler prerequisites outlined in the [Prerequisites & System Requirements guide](/getting-started/setup-basics/prerequisites-requirements) before applying patches.
</Check>

<Warning>
Always verify your tests after upgrading, as bug fixes may expose latent issues or interactions previously masked by known bugs.
</Warning>

## Summary

This page provides a comprehensive overview of resolved bugs and maintenance updates in GoogleTest and GoogleMock that directly affect test stability, correctness, and performance.

---

### Glossary

- **Expectation**: A declared anticipated interaction on a mock method, set via `EXPECT_CALL`.
- **Default Action**: Behavior specified with `ON_CALL` defining what a mock method does when called without explicit expectations.
- **Sticky Expectations**: Expectations that remain active even after reaching call count limits, unless `RetiresOnSaturation()` is specified.

## Example Patch Note

```markdown
### Version 1.16.0 Patch Update
- Fixed crashes when mocking overloaded methods with ambiguous signatures.
- Corrected behavior of `EXPECT_CALL` resolution ordering to prevent unexpected upper-bound violations.
- Improved default action invocation on mocks returning move-only types.
- Resolved race conditions related to mock expectations in multi-threaded test executions.
- Fixed printing of failure messages with custom predicates to include complete argument info.
