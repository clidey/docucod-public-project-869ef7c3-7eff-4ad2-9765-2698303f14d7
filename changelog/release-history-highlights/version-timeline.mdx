# Version Timeline

The Version Timeline page provides a clear, concise overview of each major and minor release of GoogleMock and GoogleTest, presenting release dates alongside direct links to detailed resources. This page is your go-to reference for quickly identifying when new features, important fixes, or breaking changes were introduced, helping you stay informed about the evolution of the framework.

## Navigating the Version Timeline

### Quick Release Snapshots
Each entry in the timeline summarizes the **version number**, **release date**, and **type of release** (major, minor, patch). This snapshot helps you instantly assess the scale and relevance of the update.

### Direct Links to Release Details
For every version listed, you will find links guiding you to detailed release notes, changelogs, bug fixes, and migration guides where applicable. These enable you to dive deeper into changes without losing time searching.

### Organized for Efficiency
Releases are arranged in reverse chronological order, putting the latest version right at your fingertips. This design supports efficient user flow — whether you're verifying new capabilities or investigating recent fixes.

## Why Use the Version Timeline?

- **Understand What’s New:** Track exactly when new features, improvements, and security updates became available.
- **Prepare for Migration:** Identify breaking changes early with links to migration support.
- **Audit Past Versions:** Quickly find the history of fixes and changes for troubleshooting or compliance.

## How the Version Timeline Fits into GoogleMock Documentation

Situated within the [Changelog](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/changelog) section, this page is crafted to complement detailed guides on:
- [Breaking Changes & Migration Guidance](#/changelog/breaking-changes-migrations/breaking-changes)
- [Bug Fixes & Patch Notes](#/changelog/release-details/bugfixes-patches)
- [Notable Additions & Improvements](#/changelog/release-history-highlights/notable-additions)

Together, they provide a comprehensive picture of the product's progression, rooted in clear user-facing impact.

## Practical Tips

- When viewing the timeline, prioritize checking the **latest releases first** to take advantage of enhancements and fixes.
- Look for any **deprecation notices or breaking changes** linked alongside versions; adapting early smooths upgrade paths.
- Use the timeline as a **reference index** when coordinating your CI/CD updates or verifying environment compatibility.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don’t assume earlier versions or patches include the latest security fixes—always cross-reference with the timeline.
- Avoid overlooking the links to migration guides, especially when moving between major versions.
- Be wary of skipping intermediate releases if they contain critical bug fixes relevant to your usage.
