# Version Overview

This page provides a clear and concise summary of the key releases in the evolution of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Designed to help developers and maintainers quickly understand major milestones, compatibility shifts, and strategic direction changes, this overview guides informed decision-making regarding upgrades and project adoption.

## 1. Release Versioning and Compatibility

GoogleTest and GoogleMock follow semantic versioning principles, with version numbers reflecting the extent of changes:

- **Major Versions** introduce breaking changes and new features that may require user migration effort.
- **Minor Versions** add backward-compatible enhancements and improvements.
- **Patch Versions** focus on bug fixes and security patches with no API changes.

Compatibility is carefully managed to ensure smooth integration with existing projects. Where breaking changes occur, migration guidance accompanies releases to assist developers.

## 2. Major Milestones and Strategic Updates

Key releases have defined the project’s maturation and ecosystem impact:

- **Integration of GoogleMock with GoogleTest:** From early versions, GoogleMock was incorporated tightly to enable combined unit testing and mocking for C++ with a unified API.

- **C++17 Support Adoption:** Starting with versions around v1.10 and later, a C++17 standard became a baseline to leverage modern language features for improved safety and usability.

- **Build System Enhancements:** Support for common build environments like CMake and Bazel solidified, with modernized build scripts and detailed package configurations easing integration in various development setups.

- **Platform and Compiler Compatibility:** Continuous expansion in supported platforms and compilers, including Windows (MSVC), Linux, macOS, and environments like MinGW, with detailed compiler flag tuning to ensure reliable builds.

- **Expanded Testing Features:** Enhancements in mock expectations, argument matching, advanced actions, and strictness modes improved the expressiveness and control testers have over their unit tests.

## 3. Notable Breaking Changes and Considerations

While backward compatibility is a priority, key releases introduced breaking changes to align with modern C++ practices or resolve longstanding issues:

- **Removal or Renaming of Deprecated Macros:** Some macros and features have been deprecated to reduce confusion and encourage best practices. Detailed migration documentation is provided.

- **Changes in Build Configuration Options:** Adjustments in CMake options and default behaviors (e.g., runtime library linking flags) to better suit cross-platform builds.

- **Stricter Compiler Flag Enforcement:** Adoption of more rigorous compiler warning settings to encourage clean, safe code necessitates updates in user code to meet new requirements.

Users upgrading should consult the migration and breaking change guides linked in the Changelog for step-by-step assistance.

## 4. Evolution of Testing and Mocking Features

The releases have progressively enriched the mocking API and test framework capabilities:

- Expanded `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` constructs with more flexible argument matching and cardinality controls.

- Introduction of wrappers like `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` allowing nuanced control over mock strictness and error reporting.

- Support for custom actions and matchers, enabling domain-specific testing scenarios with precise behavior customization.

- Enhancements in test runner configuration, selective test execution, and improved test reporting for better diagnostics and integration.

## 5. Build and Installation Improvements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have refined their build and installation processes over time:

- **CMake Integration:** The CMakeLists.txt files have been updated to support modern CMake features and provide clear options such as `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` and `gmock_build_tests` for flexible configuration.

- **Pkg-config Support:** The introduction of `.pc.in` templates for `gmock`, `gmock_main`, `gtest`, and `gtest_main` facilitates package discovery and linking in many build systems.

- **Test Suite Build Options:** Users can choose to build Google Mock’s own extensive tests with a specific option, allowing streamlined builds in production environments.

- **Cross-Compiler and Platform Setup:** Compiler and linker flags are carefully managed for compatibility, including MSVC-specific settings and pthread detection for POSIX platforms.
