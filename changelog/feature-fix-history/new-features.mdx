# New Features and Improvements

Discover the latest advances in GoogleTest designed to help you write better C++ tests with more expressiveness, flexibility, and performance. This page highlights newly added functionality and usability enhancements that streamline test writing, improve test feedback, and extend the API to cover a wider range of testing scenarios.

---

## 1. Enhanced Test Registration

GoogleTest now supports dynamic and flexible test registration, allowing you to programmatically add tests at runtime. This improvement lets you register tests based on configuration or data sets without modifying source code.

### Key Highlights

- **RegisterTest function template**: Enables registering tests with custom factories, supporting advanced test creation workflows.
- **Automatic Fixture Detection**: The framework infers the test fixture type from your factory, ensuring proper lifecycle hooks (`SetUpTestSuite`, `TearDownTestSuite`) are called.

### Usage Example

```cpp
// Custom test fixture
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* initialization */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* cleanup */ }
};

// Custom test case
class MyCustomTest : public MyTestFixture {
 public:
  void TestBody() override {
    // Test logic here
  }
};

// Registering the test dynamically
void RegisterMyTests() {
  ::testing::RegisterTest(
      "MyTestSuite", "DynamicTest1", nullptr, nullptr, __FILE__, __LINE__,
      []() -> MyTestFixture* { return new MyCustomTest(); });
}
```

This pattern empowers creating data-driven tests or complex conditional registrations.

---

## 2. Improved Assertion Macros

New assertion macros and enhancements to existing ones make your tests more expressive and easier to debug.

### Additions and Enhancements

- **Fatal and Nonfatal Assertions**: Distinction is clearer and better supported allowing you to decide whether to abort test execution on failure (`ASSERT_*`) or continue running (`EXPECT_*`).
- **Support for streaming failure messages**: Add detailed custom messages via streaming syntax to provide richer context.

### Practical Tip

Use `ASSERT_*` macros where a failure invalidates the rest of the test and `EXPECT_*` to check multiple conditions per test, surfacing all issues at once.

Example:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(vector.size(), 3) << "Vector size mismatch";
EXPECT_TRUE(ValidateVector(vector)) << "Vector failed validation";
```

---

## 3. Test Fixtures and Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest continues to enhance test fixtures and parameterized testing to simplify writing reusable tests.

### Features

- **Enhanced TEST_F and TEST_P macros**: Support fixtures that encapsulate common setup/teardown for multiple tests.
- **Value and Type Parameterized Tests**: Robust support for generating test cases over ranges of values or types with fine-grained control over naming and execution.

### Usage Scenario

For example, use `TEST_P` to run the same test with multiple inputs while sharing setup logic:

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* shared setup */ }
};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, HandlesValues) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveNumbers, MyParamTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This ensures comprehensive coverage with minimal boilerplate.

---

## 4. Rich Test Result Reporting

Your tests now yield more detailed results to help diagnose issues faster.

### Key Improvements

- **Detailed TestPartResult and TestProperty Support**: Allows tests to report granular success/failure details and custom properties.
- **Elapsed Time and Start Time Tracking**: Each test and test suite now tracks timings in milliseconds for performance insights.
- **Skip and Fatal Failure Distinctions**: Easily identify skipped tests versus different failure severities.

### Practical Usage

Within test code, you can record custom properties:

```cpp
TEST(MySuite, ExampleTest) {
  testing::Test::RecordProperty("input_size", 1024);
  ASSERT_TRUE(MyFunction());
}
```

This metadata is included in test reports and XML output if enabled.

---

## 5. Exception Testing Support

GoogleTest provides macros to verify exception throwing behavior, essential for testing robust error handling.

### Macros Include

- `ASSERT_THROW`, `EXPECT_THROW`: Validate that a statement throws a specific exception type.
- `ASSERT_NO_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW`: Confirm no exceptions are thrown.
- `ASSERT_ANY_THROW`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`: Check that any exception is thrown.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionUnderTest(), std::runtime_error);
ASSERT_NO_THROW(AnotherFunction());
```

These macros integrate exception checks cleanly into your tests.

---

## 6. Skipping Tests at Runtime

Introduce conditional skipping to gracefully exclude tests based on runtime conditions.

### Usage

- Call `GTEST_SKIP()` within a test or fixture setup to bypass execution without failure.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, ConditionalSkip) {
  if (!IsEnvironmentReady()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "Environment not ready, skipping.";
  }
  // Proceed with test
}
```

This helps maintain test suite hygiene when certain tests depend on external state.

---

## 7. Test Event Listener API

A flexible interface to customize and react to test events is now richer and easier to use.

### Capabilities

- Extend `TestEventListener` to receive callbacks at key points such as test start, end, assertion result, and environment setup/teardown.
- Default implementations provided via `EmptyTestEventListener` to simplify overrides â€” implement only the methods of interest.

### Example

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting test: " << test_info.name() << "\n";
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished test: " << test_info.name() << "\n";
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  auto& listeners = ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
  listeners.Append(new MyListener);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Use this API to augment logging, metrics, or custom reporting.

---

## 8. Performance and Efficiency Enhancements

Behind the scenes, GoogleTest has evolved to improve runtime performance and resource usage.

### Highlights

- Faster test case iteration and execution.
- Improved memory management during test runs.
- Better thread safety and synchronization primitives.

These upgrades ensure GoogleTest scales smoothly to large codebases and CI environments.
