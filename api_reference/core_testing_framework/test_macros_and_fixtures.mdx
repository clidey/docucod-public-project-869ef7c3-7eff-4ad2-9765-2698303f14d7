# Test Macros and Fixtures

Detailed guide to GoogleTest's macros for declaring tests (`TEST`, `TEST_F`), test fixtures, and suite organization. Covers the `Test`, `TestSuite`, and `UnitTest` classes, their lifecycle, and common usage patterns for structuring robust C++ unit tests.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest enables developers to write, organize, and run C++ test code effectively using various macros and fixture classes. This page focuses specifically on the mechanics and best practices for defining tests and fixtures — key building blocks of test programs — translating user intent into powerful, maintainable test suites.

You will learn:

- How to write simple tests with `TEST()`
- How to structure reusable code across tests with fixtures and `TEST_F()`
- The lifecycle of tests, suites, and the overall test program
- The roles of `TestSuite`, `TestInfo`, and `UnitTest` classes in test registration and execution

---

## 1. Simple Test Definitions (`TEST` Macro)

### Purpose
The `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro defines a single, independent test function that verifies a particular behavior or outcome.

### What You Achieve
You declare a test named *TestName* inside a test suite *TestSuiteName*. Each test is a function that runs once when you run all tests.

### Usage
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

### Naming Rules
- Both `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` must be valid C++ identifiers, containing **no underscores** — underscores are reserved and can cause ambiguity.
- Tests in different suites can have the same test name.

### Behavior
When run, GoogleTest executes each `TEST()` function independently and reports results based on contained assertions.

<Info>
The naming convention ensures generated test classes do not clash or violate C++ rules. Keep tests descriptive yet concise.
</Info>

## 2. Test Fixtures (`TEST_F` Macro)

### Why Use Fixtures?
When multiple tests need to share the same setup, teardown, or helper functions and data, fixtures package this shared code into a class. This avoids code duplication and makes tests cleaner and easier to maintain.

### How to Define a Fixture
1. Derive a class from `testing::Test`. Begin your member declarations with `protected:`.
2. Define data members needed by multiple tests.
3. Override `SetUp()` to configure the common test state before each test runs.
4. Override `TearDown()` if needed for cleanup.

### Using Fixtures in Tests
Tests using fixtures are declared with `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)`, which gives tests access to fixture members directly.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Notes
- GoogleTest creates a fresh fixture object per test to maintain test isolation.
- If a test modifies fixture state, it must restore it or expect isolated state resets.
- Use `TEST_F` when you require test setup beyond basic `TEST()` capabilities.

<Warning>
The class must have a default constructor accessible by GoogleTest. If you explicitly define non-default constructors, also define a default one.
</Warning>

## 3. Test and Test Suite Classes & Lifecycle

GoogleTest organizes tests into structured hierarchies managed via core classes:

### `Test`
- Abstract base class for all test instances.
- Defines hook methods such as `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, and runs the individual test body.

### `TestInfo`
- Stores metadata about a registered test (name, file, line, fixture, and result).
- Invokes the test body when executed.

### `TestSuite`
- Groups multiple `TestInfo` objects logically.
- Manages shared setup and teardown across tests via static fixture methods.
- Keeps track of aggregate test result data.

### `UnitTest`
- Manages all registered test suites.
- Controls global test execution, environment setup/teardown, filtering, and reporting.

### Lifecycle Overview

1. Tests are registered during program initialization (via macros or dynamic registration).
2. When `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called, `UnitTest` triggers:
   - Global environment setup
   - Each `TestSuite`’s static `SetUpTestSuite()`
   - Each `TestInfo`'s `Run()` which calls the fixture setup and test body
   - Each `TestSuite`’s static `TearDownTestSuite()`
   - Global environment teardown

<Steps>
<Step title="Register Tests">
Tests and fixtures are registered with GoogleTest pre-run. You can also dynamically register tests programmatically.
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize and Parse Flags">
GoogleTest processes flags that influence test execution, filtering, and output.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Tests">
The `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` macro launches execution of all registered tests respecting filters and suites.
</Step>
<Step title="Aggregate and Report Results">
Aggregated results from test suites and environments are recorded and reported with summaries and optional XML/JSON output.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Naming Conventions and Best Practices

### Test Suites and Tests
- Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names to prevent naming collisions or compilation errors.
- Use PascalCase or camelCase identifiers.

### Test Fixture Classes
- Name fixtures representing the tested class with suffix `Test`. For example, for class `Foo`, fixture can be `FooTest`.
- Keep fixture classes focused and cohesive.

### Test Names
- Make test names descriptive yet concise, e.g., `HandlesZeroInput`, `ThrowsOnNegative`, `IgnoresEmptyString`.

### Test Organization
- Group logically related tests into test suites or fixture classes.
- Use `TEST()` for simple tests and `TEST_F()` when sharing setup or helpers.

## 5. Advanced Usage Patterns

### Using `TEST_P` and Parameterized Tests
Explore use of value-parameterized tests with `TEST_P`, fixed in fixture class inheritance, and instantiated via `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to test various inputs across the same code path. See [Parameterized and Typed Tests](parameterized_and_typed_tests.md).

### Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests
Use typed tests when you want to run the same test logic across multiple types. Use the `TYPED_TEST` macros and corresponding type lists.

### Dynamic Test Registration
You can also register tests at runtime using `RegisterTest()`, which allows building tests programmatically.

## 6. Sample Code

### Define a Simple Test

```cpp
// Tests factorial of 0.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

// Tests factorial of positive numbers.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(8), 40320);
}
```

### Define a Fixture and Use It

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Writing the main() Function

Typically, you don't need to write a main function because GoogleTest provides one.
But for custom setup, do this:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues in Test Macros and Fixtures">
<Accordion title="Compilation errors regarding test fixture constructors">
Ensure your test fixture classes have a default constructor. If you declare any non-default constructors, also declare a default constructor explicitly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test suite fixture mismatch errors">
Do not mix `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` with the same test suite name; all tests in one suite must share the same fixture class.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Underscores in test suite or test names cause errors">
Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent ambiguous symbols and compiler errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  end

  UnitTest->>UnitTest: TearDown global environments
  UnitTest-->>Main: return test result
```

## Practical Tips
- Always use `ASSERT_*` when test continuation after failure is meaningless; otherwise prefer `EXPECT_*`.
- Use fixtures (`TEST_F`) to avoid duplication when multiple tests share setup/teardown.
- Keep tests independent to ensure repeatability and reliable debugging.
- Avoid underscores in names to keep things simple and avoid collisions.
- Ensure any global set up or tear down is done via `Environment` classes or static fixture methods.
