# Portability and Configuration

This page provides detailed documentation of the low-level APIs and configuration mechanisms that enable GoogleTest and GoogleMock to operate reliably and consistently across a wide variety of platforms and architectures. It covers critical platform abstraction layers, threading primitives, file system helpers, environment variable access, and configuration flags that govern behavior in different environments.

---

## Environment and Platform Detection

GoogleTest and GoogleMock automatically detect the compilation environment to tailor behavior for various operating systems, architectures, and compilers. This enables seamless operation across common platforms such as Linux, Windows (including MinGW and Windows Mobile variants), macOS, Android, iOS, BSD derivatives, and embedded systems.

### Key Platform Macros

The following macros are defined internally to describe the platform:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_ANDROID`, etc.
- Variants for Windows such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_PHONE`
- Mac OS and iOS differentiation via `GTEST_OS_MAC` and `GTEST_OS_IOS`

Users rarely need to interact with these directly but they form the foundation for many conditional behaviors within GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

## Configuration Macros and Flags

To customize and fine-tune the behavior of the testing frameworks, configuration macros may be defined at compile time. These include, but are not limited to:

- **Exception support:** `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` evaluates whether exceptions are enabled.
- **Thread safety:** `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` indicates whether threading primitives are available.
- **RTTI support:** `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` shows if runtime type information is enabled.
- **POSIX support:** `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` designate availability of POSIX features.

Configuration macros can be overridden to adapt GoogleTest to niche or embedded environments.

## Threading Primitives

Thread safety is fundamental in modern testing environments, particularly when tests run in parallel or spawn threads.

### Mutex and Locking

GoogleTest provides platform-abstracted mutex and lock classes:

- `Mutex`: Represents a mutual exclusion lock.
- `GTestMutexLock`: RAII-style lock guard acquiring and releasing a mutex.

The implementation uses native primitives:

- For Windows, it uses `CRITICAL_SECTION`.
- For POSIX platforms, it wraps `pthread_mutex_t`.

The API is consistent regardless of platform, enabling tests to safely synchronize concurrent operations.

### Thread Local Storage

To maintain thread-specific data, GoogleTest offers the `ThreadLocal<T>` template:

- On Windows, provides custom implementation using native TLS.
- On POSIX systems, built upon `pthread_key_create` and associated APIs.

Example usage:

```cpp
ThreadLocal<int> tls(42);  // Each thread starts with 42
int val = tls.get();        // Gets thread-specific value
tls.set(100);              // Sets value for current thread
```

### Thread Management Utilities

Helper classes such as `ThreadWithParam<T>` assist internal GoogleTest tests by managing threads with function parameters and synchronization notifications, but these are primarily internal and not designed for general user consumption.

---

## File System and Path Helpers

Cross-platform file and path utilities help GoogleTest manage test artifacts, logs, and temporary files.

### File System Wrappers

The `posix` namespace wraps common POSIX-like functions with Windows compatibility:

- `FOpen`, `FReopen`, `FDOpen`, `FClose` for file operations.
- `Stat` and `RmDir` for directory and file status.
- `IsDir` to check if a path is a directory.

On Windows (non-Mobile), `FOpen` adapts UTF-8 paths to wide-character APIs transparently.

### Path Separators

- `GTEST_PATH_SEP_` is `"\\"` on Windows and `"/"` on other platforms.
- Alternate path separator support exists for some systems.

These abstractions ensure file and directory paths work seamlessly across OSes.

---

## Environment Variables

GoogleTest exposes simple mechanisms to query and interpret environment variables:

- `GetEnv(const char* name)`: Returns the environment variable value or `nullptr` if unset.
- Special handling is implemented to accommodate embedded platforms lacking environment variable support.

These utilities support configuring test runs dynamically based on the environment.

---

## Regular Expression Support

GoogleTest selects the most suitable regular expression implementation based on build environment:

- Uses RE2 library when compiled with Abseil support.
- Otherwise, prefers POSIX extended regex if available.
- Falls back to a simple custom regex matching implementation if neither is available.

This ensures consistent regex-based assertions and matchers across platforms.

---

## Command-Line Flags API

GoogleMock defines macros in `gmock-port.h` leveraging either Abseil's flags library or internal flag implementations. Common macros include:

- `GMOCK_DEFINE_bool_(name, default_val, doc)`, `GMOCK_DECLARE_bool_(name)`
- `GMOCK_FLAG_GET(name)`, `GMOCK_FLAG_SET(name, value)`

These macros allow defining, declaring, and accessing command-line flags controlling GoogleMock's behavior.

### Example: Accessing a GoogleMock Flag

```cpp
bool verbose = GMOCK_FLAG_GET(verbose);
GMOCK_FLAG_SET(verbose, true);
```

---

## Build Configuration Helpers

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide extensive CMake integration utilities which configure:

- Compiler flags tailored for strict warnings, exception handling, and cross-platform compatibility.
- Linker flags for static or shared builds.
- Pthreads detection and linking.
- Installation targets with pkg-config support.

These utilities help maintain consistent builds that adapt to the underlying platform properties.

---

## Compiler Features and Behavior Detection

The framework detects:

- Support for C++ language features (C++17 is required).
- Exception handling support.
- RTTI availability.
- Compiler-specific warnings and pragmas.

Based on these detections, compilation flags and code paths are chosen to optimize compatibility and robustness.

---

## Error and Log Handling

GoogleTest includes utilities for formatted logging and error checking:

- `GTEST_LOG_` macro for logging at severity INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL.
- `GTEST_CHECK_` macro asserts conditions and aborts on failure.
- Suppression macros for compiler warnings.

These facilities help in tracing test behavior and diagnosing failures.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Thread safety:** For multi-threaded tests, ensure that your platform supports pthreads or Windows threading as detected by the framework.
- **Compiler flags:** Verify C++17 standard is enabled; mismatch in runtime libraries on Windows can cause build errors - use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option when integrating with MSVC projects.
- **Flag usage:** Use provided macros to access and set GoogleMock flags to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Cross-platform paths:** Avoid hardcoding path separators; use abstractions provided by the framework.
