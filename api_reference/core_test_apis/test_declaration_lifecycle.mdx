# Test Declaration & Lifecycle

GoogleTest provides a powerful and flexible way to declare and manage tests, test fixtures, and test suites using core macros and class templates. This page guides you through structuring your tests effectively and managing setup and teardown logic to create robust, maintainable testing code.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Organization

GoogleTest is built upon familiar xUnit principles, structuring tests primarily as:

- **Tests**: Individual verification scenarios
- **Test Suites**: Groups of related tests, often sharing fixtures
- **Test Fixtures**: Classes that manage common setup/teardown logic and data for tests in a suite

This hierarchy promotes clarity, isolation, and reusability, helping you organize your test code to reflect your applicationâ€™s structure.

### Naming Conventions

Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names to prevent conflicts due to macro-generated class names. Use descriptive, PascalCase names that convey intent clearly (e.g., `QueueTest`, `HandlesZeroInput`).


## 2. Declaring Tests

### 2.1 Simple Test Cases with `TEST()` Macro

When your test does not require shared setup or data, use the `TEST()` macro. This defines a test function within a test suite:

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  // Test code here
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

- `TestSuiteName` groups related tests.
- `TestName` names the individual test.

GoogleTest automatically registers tests defined with `TEST()`, so no manual enumeration is necessary.

### 2.2 Best Practices for `TEST()`

- Keep tests atomic, focused on a single behavior.
- Use `EXPECT_*` assertions to continue within the test after failure, and `ASSERT_*` where failure should abort the test body.


## 3. Using Test Fixtures: Sharing Setup and Teardown

When tests share common setup or require resources that need configuration or cleanup, use test fixtures by deriving from `testing::Test`.

### Defining a Fixture

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Initialize your shared resources here
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  ~QueueTest() override = default; // Default destructor suffices

  // Optional: override SetUp/TearDown for per-test setup
  void SetUp() override {}
  void TearDown() override {}

  Queue<int> q0_, q1_, q2_;  // Test data
};
```

### Writing Tests with Fixtures

Use `TEST_F()` to write tests that use the fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;
}
```

For each `TEST_F`, GoogleTest:

1. Constructs a fresh fixture object
2. Calls `SetUp()`
3. Runs the test body
4. Calls `TearDown()`
5. Destructs the fixture

This ensures test independence and prevents side-effect bleed.


## 4. Setup and Teardown Lifecycle

Managing setup and teardown correctly is crucial for reliable tests. GoogleTest provides multiple levels of setup and teardown to support fine-grained control.

### 4.1 Per-Test Setup/Teardown

- **Constructor and Destructor**: Ideal for initializing and destroying member variables. Preferred for simple, exception-free setup.
- **`SetUp()` and `TearDown()` Methods**: Use when setup can fail or requires assertions. Run immediately before and after each test.

**Best Practice:** Avoid performing assertions inside constructors or destructors; prefer `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for test-validation related setup.

### 4.2 Per-Test-Suite Setup/Teardown

Use `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive or shared resource initialization:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};

Resource* FooTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

These methods run once before the first test and once after the last test respectively.

### 4.3 Global Test Environment Setup

For setup/teardown at the entire test program level, subclass `testing::Environment` and register it:

```cpp
class MyEnvironment : public testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Global setup code
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Global teardown code
  }
};

testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnvironment);
```

This executes before and after all tests in all suites.


## 5. Declaring Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports advanced test types for increased coverage:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**: Run the same test code with multiple data inputs.
- **Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)**: Run the same tests on different types.

These require inheritance from `testing::TestWithParam<T>` or template fixture classes, and are covered in great detail in advanced guides.


## 6. Running the Tests

GoogleTest requires two key calls to drive test execution:

- **`testing::InitGoogleTest()`**: Parses command-line flags and initializes GoogleTest infrastructure. Crucial for recognizing flags affecting test runs.

- **`RUN_ALL_TESTS()`**: Invokes all registered tests and returns 0 on success, nonzero on failures.

Sample `main()` function:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Note on `main()`

Most users link with `gtest_main` which provides an implementation of `main()` for convenience. You only need to write your own `main()` if custom initialization or environment set-up is required.


## 7. Best Practices in Test Lifecycle

- **Maintain test independence**: Each test runs on a fresh fixture instance ensuring clean state.
- **Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` over constructors/destructors** for test logic that involves assertions or can fail.
- **Leverage per-suite setup for expensive shared resources** to improve test suite performance.
- **Do not ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`**; it indicates overall test success/failure.
- **Avoid calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` more than once**.
- **Use test fixtures for grouping logically related tests with common setup.**


## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Setup Not Called">
Check you are correctly using `TEST()` for simple tests or `TEST_F()` for tests requiring fixtures. Ensure that fixture classes have default constructors, a common cause of compile errors when using `TEST_F()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Fatal Assertion in Constructor/Destructor">
GoogleTest prohibits fatal assertions in constructors and destructors. Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for initialization and cleanup containing assertions or operations that may fail.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ignoring RUN_ALL_TESTS() Return Value">
Make sure your `main()` returns the value from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to signal test success or failure to external systems.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Sharing State Unexpectedly">
Ensure that shared state is properly reset between tests. Use fresh fixtures for each test and carefully manage any static or global data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 9. Illustrative Example

This example demonstrates a full test fixture and test suite declaration:

```cpp
// The class under test
template <typename T>
class Queue {
 public:
  Queue() {}
  void Enqueue(const T& element) { data_.push_back(element); }
  T* Dequeue() {
    if (data_.empty()) return nullptr;
    T* front = new T(data_.front());
    data_.erase(data_.begin());
    return front;
  }
  size_t size() const { return data_.size(); }
 private:
  std::vector<T> data_;
};

class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
  delete n;
}
```

## Example `main()` Implementation from `gmock_main.cc`

Most users can simply link with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` (which includes GoogleMock) and do not need to write their own `main`. If custom logic is needed, this is the expected pattern:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This simplifies initialization by combining GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup.
