# Continuous Integration & Automation FAQ

GoogleTest and GoogleMock seamlessly integrate into modern Continuous Integration (CI) and automated build environments. This FAQ helps you overcome common challenges encountered when running tests in CI pipelines, managing platform-specific differences, and configuring test output to optimize feedback and diagnostics.

---

## 1. Common CI/CD Issues and Solutions

### Why do my tests pass locally but fail on the CI runner?
Differences in environment, compiler versions, or platform configurations can cause discrepancies. Common culprits include:

- **Platform variability:** Some tests rely on platform-specific features, filesystem layouts, or environment variables.
- **Race conditions:** Parallel execution may expose threading issues not seen locally.
- **Resource constraints:** CI runners may have limited CPU, memory, or disk space.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure CI runners use the same compiler and environment as local development.
- Use GoogleTest's [**`--gtest_repeat`**](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md#retrying-a-fail) and [**`--gtest_shuffle`**](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md#randomizing-test-order) flags to detect flaky tests.
- Isolate tests by using test fixtures and avoid sharing state.
- Monitor CI resource usage to identify bottlenecks.

### How do I configure GoogleTest output for CI dashboards?
GoogleTest supports several output formats suited for CI integration:

- **XML output:** Use `--gtest_output=xml[:path]` to generate XML results consumable by most CI tools.
- **JUnit format:** GoogleTest’s XML output is JUnit-compatible.

Configure your CI pipeline to collect these XML reports to display test results and track failures over time.

### Can GoogleMock interfere with my CI test stability?
Yes, if mock expectations are too strict or uninteresting calls cause warnings or failures, tests might behave inconsistently.

**Best practices:**
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default mock behaviors and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for critical interactions.
- Prefer using `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls unless verification is essential.
- Use `StrictMock` sparingly, as it makes tests brittle by failing on unexpected calls.

### Why does my CI build fail with linker errors related to GoogleTest/GoogleMock?
Common causes and fixes:

- **Multiple definitions of `main()`:** GoogleMock includes a default `main()` in `gmock_main` library. Avoid linking both `gtest_main` and `gmock_main` together.
- **Missing or conflicting library dependencies:** Make sure GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are linked correctly. Use documented CMake or Bazel integration steps.
- **Platform-specific dynamic linking issues:** On Windows, ensure consistent runtime library linkage (static/dynamic) to avoid conflicts.

See the [Build System & IDE Integration FAQ](/faq/integration-and-environment-faq/build-integration) for detailed guidance.

### My tests time out or appear hung in the CI environment. What should I do?
Tests depending on asynchronous execution or threads can hang if synchronization primitives are waiting indefinitely.

- Use GoogleMock's [Notification](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#testing-asynchronous-behavior) or timeout-aware synchronization with `WaitForNotificationWithTimeout`.
- Add diagnostic logging and consider increasing `--gtest_timeout` in CI runner options.
- Isolate flaky tests and disable them temporarily to unblock the pipeline.

## 2. Platform Differences and CI Environment

### How can I manage tests that fail on specific platforms (Windows/Linux/macOS)?
Use GoogleTest's [platform macros](overview/integration-and-ecosystem/platforms-dependencies) to conditionally compile or skip tests:

```cpp
#if GTEST_OS_WINDOWS
  // Windows-specific test or workaround
#else
  // Other platforms
#endif
```

Alternatively, use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests at runtime with a clear message.

### How do I handle flaky or non-deterministic tests in CI?
- Run tests multiple times with the `--gtest_repeat=N` flag to expose flakiness.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test order.
- Isolate non-deterministic tests using test filters and address the root cause.

### How do I optimize test performance in CI pipelines?
- Use [parallel test execution](guides/integration-and-realworld/performance-tips).
- Avoid expensive resource dependencies in tests, mock external dependencies with GoogleMock.
- Cache build artifacts and dependencies in CI to speed up rebuilds.

## 3. Configuring GoogleTest and GoogleMock for CI

### What are recommended command-line flags for CI test runs?
Common flags to enhance CI integration and visibility include:

- `--gtest_output=xml:report.xml` — exports test results to XML.
- `--gtest_color=no` — disables color output for clear logs.
- `--gtest_shuffle` — randomizes test order.
- `--gtest_repeat=<N>` — repeats tests to uncover flakiness.
- `--gmock_verbose=info` — increases verbosity for mock call tracing.

### How do I suppress mock warnings about uninteresting calls in CI?
Use `NiceMock` wrappers for mocks or add explicit `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for methods expected to be called without strict verification.

### How can I ensure mocks verify expectations before test completion in CI?
Mocks verify on destruction. If mocks are heap-allocated and owned outside tests, consider calling:

```cpp
::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

This forces verification and clears expectations early.

### How do I troubleshoot failing tests on CI?
- Run tests locally with flags mirrored from CI.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to halt at first failure.
- Increase verbosity via `--gmock_verbose=info`.
- Review CI logs for test failures, stack traces, and warnings.

## 4. Sample CI Workflow Integration

### Basic Steps

1. **Build Step:** Compile GoogleTest and your tests using CMake or Bazel, including GoogleMock if needed.
2. **Test Execution:** Run tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` through a test executable.
3. **Result Collection:** Generate XML reports with `--gtest_output=xml` for ingestion by dashboards.
4. **Failure Handling:** Detect failed tests and logs from GoogleTest and GoogleMock, analyze output.

### Example: GitHub Actions Snippet

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: |
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ..
        make
    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        ./my_tests --gtest_output=xml:report.xml --gtest_color=no
    - name: Upload Test Reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: test-reports
        path: build/report.xml
```

## 5. Troubleshooting Common CI Errors

### Test Discovery Failures
- Verify test binaries include GoogleTest main entry point (usually from `gtest_main`).
- Ensure test names and suites follow expected patterns.

### Missing or Incorrect Mock Behavior
- Confirm expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) are set before exercising mocks.
- Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior to avoid uninteresting call warnings.

### Linker Errors
- Avoid duplicate linking of `gtest_main` and `gmock_main`.
- Verify order of libraries and dependencies in linker settings.

### Timing Out or Hanging Tests
- Identify tests with asynchronous code and add synchronization using `Notification`.
- Run tests with timeout flags or CI-specific timeout settings.
