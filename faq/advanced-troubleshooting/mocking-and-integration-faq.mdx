# Mocking and Integration FAQ

This FAQ addresses common user questions and challenges related specifically to mock object creation, behavior specification, and integration within GoogleMock, including the use and implications of NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock. It also provides guidance on resolving conflicts with other frameworks or legacy code to enable smooth mocking integration.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What causes a mock method to invoke the real method instead of being mocked?

To ensure a method is mockable, it must be declared `virtual` in the base class. Non-virtual methods cannot be replaced with mock implementations unless you use specialized techniques like high-performance dependency injection described in advanced recipes. Always check your mocked interface for correct `virtual` declarations.

### 2. How do I create mocks that ignore, warn, or fail on uninteresting calls?

GoogleMock provides three wrapper templates for this:

- `NiceMock<MockClass>`: suppresses warnings for calls to mock methods without expectations (uninteresting calls).
- `NaggyMock<MockClass>`: warns on uninteresting calls (default behavior of plain mocks).
- `StrictMock<MockClass>`: treats all uninteresting calls as test failures.

They inherit constructors from the mock class, so you can create instances just as you would for `MockClass`.

Example:
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;      // Uninteresting calls ignored.
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_foo;    // Uninteresting calls warn (default).
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;  // Uninteresting calls cause test failures.
```

### 3. Can I nest `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers?

No. Nesting strictness modifiers (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockFoo>>`) is unsupported and can cause unexpected behavior due to internal implementation limitations.

### 4. What happens if my mock class has mock methods declared in base classes?

The nice, naggy, and strict wrappers only reliably affect mock methods defined directly in the mock class using `MOCK_METHOD`. Mock methods inherited from base classes may not be affected depending on your compiler. To avoid inconsistencies, define mock methods directly in the mock class.

### 5. How do I suppress warnings for uninteresting calls if I am sure they are safe?

Use `NiceMock` to silence warnings across the mock object, or add a catch-all expectation for the method:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, MethodName(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

which tells the framework to expect calls without further restrictions.

### 6. How can I create `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` instances if my mock has non-default constructors?

You can construct `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` objects just like the mock class itself since they forward constructor arguments:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo(arg1, arg2);
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo(arg1, arg2);
```

There is support for up to 10 constructor arguments.

### 7. Why do I sometimes get a warning "Uninteresting function call encountered - default action taken.."?

This means that a mock method with no explicit `EXPECT_CALL` was called, and GoogleMock is using the default action for that method. It is informational — not an error — but suggests you may want to verify if this was expected. Either add an expectation, or use `NiceMock` if you want to ignore these cases safely.

### 8. How do I treat calls to static or global functions in my testing setup?

GoogleMock does not mock static or free functions directly. Instead, wrap such functions in interfaces (abstract classes) and mock those interfaces. This design encourages better modularity and facilitates dependency injection for testing.

### 9. How do I verify expectations earlier than the mock object’s destruction?

Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);` to force verification and clear expectations manually. Avoid setting new expectations after this call.

### 10. How can I avoid redundant failure messages when a test fails due to expectation mismatches?

GoogleMock prints state at different failure points to assist debugging, so seeing repeated information is intentional and reflects distinct failure times.

## Common Issues & Gotchas

### Uninteresting Calls Behavior

- Default mock objects behave as naggy mocks, printing warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Switching to `NiceMock` silences these warnings without changing test semantics.
- `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as errors, helping catch unexpected interactions.

**Best Practice:** Prefer `NiceMock` during development to reduce noise, and escalate to `StrictMock` when strict verification is needed.

### Constructor Forwarding

Mocks inside `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` forward constructor arguments to underlying mocks. If you have complex constructors, ensure usage aligns with what your mock requires.

### Limitations on Mocking Methods in Base Classes

Mock methods defined in base classes may not be impacted by strictness wrappers, potentially leading to unfiltered uninteresting call warnings or missing strict failures. Declare mocks directly in your mock subclasses to avoid this.

### Mock Lifetime and Deletion

Ensure mocks allocated on the heap are properly deleted, or use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to tell GoogleMock not to verify or warn about their destruction.

### Avoid Multiple Expectations Conflicts

More recent expectations override earlier ones for matching calls. Order your `EXPECT_CALL` statements carefully to achieve intended behavior.

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Diagnosing Real Method Calls Instead of Mocks

- Confirm methods are declared `virtual` in the base class.
- Verify your mock class uses `MOCK_METHOD` macros for those methods.

### Handling Mock Warning Noise

- Use `NiceMock` to silence warnings.
- Add explicit catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `.Times(AnyNumber())` for tolerating calls without complaints.

### Making Uninteresting Calls Fail

- Use `StrictMock` to fail tests on any unanticipated calls.
- Alternatively, specify `EXPECT_CALL(mock, SomeMethod()).Times(0)` to disallow calls.

### Dealing with Non-Default Constructible Return Types

If a mocked method returns a type with no default constructor, and you get exceptions or test failures, specify explicit default actions using `ON_CALL` or by providing expected return values with `EXPECT_CALL(...).WillOnce(Return(...))`.

### Resolving Conflicts with Other Frameworks or Legacy Code

- Avoid nesting strictness modifiers.
- Define mocks in the correct scope.
- Ensure virtual destructors are present in the mock hierarchy to avoid unexpected behaviors.

---

## Best Practices for Mock Strictness

- Prefer `NiceMock` for general use to minimize noise.
- Use `NaggyMock` (the default) when you want to be warned about unexpected interactions.
- Reserve `StrictMock` for when you want to catch all unanticipated calls to help ensure test precision.
- Avoid mixing strictness modifiers in the same mock class hierarchy.

---

## Additional Tips

- If your mock methods are overloaded, use disambiguation techniques (e.g., `Const()` or casting matchers) when setting expectations.
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors without imposing call cardinalities.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set required calls and cardinalities.
- Consider delegation to fakes or real objects for complex default behavior.

### Example Usage Summary

```cpp
class MockFoo {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoThis, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const, override));
};

// Create a nice mock that ignores uninteresting calls
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;

// Set expectation for a specific method call
EXPECT_CALL(nice_mock, DoThis()).Times(1);

// Use the mock object in your tests
nice_mock.DoThis();
```

This pattern suppresses warnings for any other method calls without expectations but verifies the ones you care about.

## Troubleshooting: Handling uninteresting calls after mock deletion

When a mock deletes itself during a method call, uninteresting call warnings can still occur due to lifecycle timing. Wrapping the mock in `NiceMock` or handling deletion carefully avoids spurious warnings.

## Summary of Strictness Levels

| Mock Type       | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Default (Naggy) | Prints warning, test continues                           |
| NiceMock        | Silences warning, test continues                         |
| StrictMock      | Counts as test failure, test fails immediately          |
