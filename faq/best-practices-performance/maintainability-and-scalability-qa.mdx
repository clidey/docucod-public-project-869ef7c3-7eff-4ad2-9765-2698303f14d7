# Maintainability and Scalability FAQ

This FAQ provides practical guidance for writing scalable and maintainable tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses on managing complexity as test suites grow, avoiding brittle patterns, and leveraging powerful features such as parameterized tests to achieve broad, robust test coverage.

## Structuring Large Test Suites {#structuring-large-test-suites}

As your project grows, so does the number of tests. Keeping them organized is critical for maintainability and clarity.

- **Group related tests into test suites** that map to the structure of your production code. This mirrors the API or component boundaries, making navigation intuitive.
- **Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) to set up common test scenarios**, reducing duplication and promoting reusability.
- **Break large tests into multiple, focused tests** to simplify debugging and pinpoint failures.
- **Leverage subdirectory and naming conventions** in the test source tree to reflect test hierarchy.

### Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common database connection setup
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Common database teardown
  }

  Database db_;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertValidRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_.Insert(record));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, RejectInvalidRecord) {
  EXPECT_FALSE(db_.Insert(invalid_record));
}
```

This makes it easier to add tests without inflating complexity.

## Avoiding Brittle Tests {#avoiding-brittle-tests}

Brittle tests break frequently due to changes in implementation details rather than functionality.

- **Focus on testing behavior, not implementation.** Avoid inspecting internal states that can frequently change.
- **Avoid over-specifying expectations.** For example, do not fix every argument of a mock call unless it is relevant.
- **Use matchers wisely.** Use `_` to allow any value for unimportant arguments.
- **Limit ordering constraints** to only those that reflect actual dependencies.

### Best Practice:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(_))  // Allow any argument
    .Times(AtLeast(1));
```

This approach reduces test fragility during refactorings or internal optimizations.

<Note>
Brittle expectations increase maintenance burden and reduce confidence in tests.
</Note>

## Parameterized Tests for Coverage and Maintainability {#parameterized-tests}

Parameterized tests enable you to run the same test logic with multiple inputs, increasing coverage without code duplication.

- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to define and instantiate parameterized tests.
- Define your input data concisely, e.g., arrays or vectors of test cases.
- This practice makes it easier to add new cases and identify failing parameters.

### Example:

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::pair<int, int>> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectly) {
  int input = GetParam().first;
  int expected = GetParam().second;
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(input), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  ValidInputs,
  FactorialTest,
  ::testing::Values(
      std::make_pair(0, 1),
      std::make_pair(1, 1),
      std::make_pair(2, 2),
      std::make_pair(3, 6)));
```

This increases test clarity and makes future extensions painless.

## Common Pitfalls That Reduce Maintainability {#common-pitfalls}

### 1. Over-using `EXPECT_CALL` for every mock method

- Specify expectations only where important. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors.

### 2. Hard-coding arguments and exact call counts

- Avoid brittle expectations that tightly couple tests to implementation details.

### 3. Ignoring test failure messages

- Carefully examine failure reports. They help pinpoint cause and avoid flapping tests.

### 4. Mixing test responsibilities

- Keep tests focused on a single behavior or contract. Avoid multi-purpose or catch-all tests.

<Warning>
Avoiding these pitfalls saves time and leads to reliable and repeatable tests.
</Warning>

## Managing Mocks in Large Codebases {#managing-mocks-large-codebases}

Mocks can grow complex and hard to maintain if not managed carefully.

- Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` to control the strictness level of mock objects and uninteresting call warnings.
- Prefer `NiceMock` for general use unless strict failures on uninteresting calls are required for sensitive code paths.
- Employ `RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations when their invocation quota is filled, simplifying multiple expectations for the same method.
- Delegate to fakes or real objects if you need to share complex behavior between tests.

### Example - Using `NiceMock`:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect())
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

This keeps test warnings manageable and tests readable.

---

## Keeping Test Expectations Clear and Focused {#clear-focused-expectations}

- Set expectations only for behaviors that your test needs to verify.
- Use matchers to ignore irrelevant arguments (`_`).
- Avoid expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())` unless absolutely necessary, and prefer `ON_CALL` real defaults instead.
- If an expectation is used more than once, consider grouping them or using sequences when order matters.

<Check>
Clear expectations improve test reliability and ease debugging.
</Check>

---

## Balancing Mock Strictness for Test Resilience {#balancing-mock-strictness}

- `NaggyMock` (default mock type) warns on uninteresting calls without failing the test.
- `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls, making tests less noisy and easier to maintain.
- `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as errors, useful for tests that need full control but risks brittleness.

Choose based on your test maintenance needs:

| Mock Type  | Effect on Uninteresting Calls       | Recommended Usage                         |
|------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| NaggyMock  | Warns (default behavior)            | During active debugging or new tests    |
| NiceMock   | Silences warnings                   | For stable, broad tests                  |
| StrictMock | Fails tests                        | For critical, tightly controlled tests  |

---

## Additional Best Practices

- **Use sequences (`InSequence`) only to enforce behavior order** where it logically matters.
- **Avoid excessive use of `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(0)`** as they may clutter tests.
- Document test intentions and assumptions clearly in comments.
- Consider refactoring interfaces or splitting test fixtures if they grow large or complex.
