# Using Advanced Test Features Effectively

This guide helps you elevate your GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage by exploring advanced features such as parameterized tests, custom assertions, death tests, and other powerful techniques that enable you to write more expressive, maintainable, and robust tests.

---

## 1. Parameterized Tests: Testing with Data Variations

Parameterized tests let you run the same test logic with different input values, improving test coverage and reducing code duplication.

### How to Create Parameterized Tests

1. Derive a test fixture from `::testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the type of parameter.
2. Define your test body using `TEST_P` macro.
3. Declare your test cases with input data using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

int Factorial(int n) {
  return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ReturnsExpectedResult) {
  int n = GetParam();
  int expected = (n <= 1) ? 1 : n * Factorial(n - 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  FactorialTests,
  FactorialTest,
  ::testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 8));
```

### Benefits
- Easily test multiple input cases.
- Maintain a single test definition.
- Enhance readability and coverage.

**Tip:** Use `TEST_P` when test logic is the same but input changes.

## 2. Custom Assertions: Expressive and Domain-Specific Checks

GoogleTest allows you to create custom assertions to verify complex conditions with clear error messages.

### Writing a Custom Assertion

A custom assertion returns `testing::AssertionResult` and explains success or failure:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AssertionResult;

AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return AssertionSuccess();
  return AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even.";
}

TEST(CustomAssertionTest, IsEvenWorks) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4));  // Passes
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(5));  // Fails with message "5 is not even."
}
```

### Using `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` for Better Error Reporting

You can add more context by writing predicate formatters, which show both expression and values.

---

## 3. Death Tests: Validating Fatal Error Scenarios

Death tests check that your code terminates as expected on fatal errors or invalid inputs, ensuring robustness.

### Basic Death Test Macros

- `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)` — Test that `statement` causes process death with stderr matching `regex`.
- `ASSERT_DEATH` — Similar to `EXPECT_DEATH` but fatal.
- `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` — Runs death tests if supported by platform.

### Example

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

void AbortIfZero(int x) {
  if (x == 0) abort();
}

TEST(DeathTest, AbortsOnZero) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(AbortIfZero(0), "");
}
```

### Best Practices
- Run death tests sparingly as they spawn new processes.
- Keep death test bodies minimal to reduce flakiness.
- Use descriptive regex to match expected error messages.

---

## 4. Using Custom Matchers for Flexible Validation

Enhance test expressiveness by writing custom matchers that validate arguments or values in intuitive ways.

### Quick Example (Matcher Macro)

```cpp
MATCHER(IsPositive, "is positive") { return (arg > 0); }

TEST(CustomMatcherTest, PositiveCheck) {
  EXPECT_THAT(5, IsPositive());
  EXPECT_THAT(-2, Not(IsPositive()));
}
```

### Advanced Usage
- Use `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, ... for parameterized matchers.
- Define polymorphic matchers for matching multiple types.
- Combine matchers using `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()`.

---

## 5. Leveraging Actions to Control Mock Behavior

Actions specify what happens when a mock method is called.

### Common Actions
- `Return(value)` — Returns a copy of the value.
- `ReturnRef(value)` — Returns a reference to the value.
- `Invoke(function)` — Calls a function or callable.
- `DoAll(action1, action2, ...)` — Performs multiple actions sequentially.
- `SetArgPointee<N>(value)` — Sets *N*-th output argument with a value.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetData(_))
    .WillOnce(Return(42));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetFlag(_))
    .WillOnce(SetArgPointee<0>(true));
```

### Tips
- Chain multiple actions using `DoAll` when both side effects and return values are needed.
- Use lambdas for custom or complex behavior.

---

## 6. Managing Expectations for Robust Tests

Expectations define how many times and in which order mock methods are called.

### Cardinalities
- `Times(n)` — Expect exactly *n* calls.
- `AtLeast(n)` — Expect at least *n* calls.
- `AtMost(n)` — Expect at most *n* calls.
- `AnyNumber()` — No limit on calls.

### Ordering
- Use `InSequence` to enforce call order within a scope.
- Use `After()` to specify dependencies between expectations.

### Handling Uninteresting Calls
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for unmapped calls.
- Use `StrictMock` to cause unmapped calls to fail tests.

### Best Practices
- Keep expectations minimal and focused — verify only the necessary contract.
- Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior without strict expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to assert the call occurs.

---

## 7. Tips for Using GoogleMock with Complex Features

- **Testing callbacks or functors:** Use `Invoke` or `InvokeWithoutArgs` to call supplied callbacks.
- **Mocking non-virtual methods:** Use templates and replace calls at compile time.
- **Handling move-only types:** Use lambdas or specify expectations carefully, avoid returning move-only objects repeatedly with `Return`.
- **Delegating calls:** You can delegate mock methods to real objects or fakes for partial behavior.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### Uninteresting vs Unexpected calls
- Uninteresting calls have no matching `EXPECT_CALL` — cause warnings by default.
- Unexpected calls match an `EXPECT_CALL` with differing arguments — cause errors.

### Excessive call errors
- Check if you have specified too few `WillOnce` actions or incorrect `Times`.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` if the expectation should be disabled after used.

### Slow compilation with big mocks
- Move mock class constructors/destructors to .cc files to speed compilation.
