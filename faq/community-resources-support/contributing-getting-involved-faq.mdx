## Why Contribute?

Many great improvements, bug fixes, and features in GoogleTest originate from community contributions. Your involvement helps:

- Improve test coverage and reliability.
- Extend functionality with new matchers, actions, or macros.
- Enhance documentation and developer experience.
- Strengthen integration with modern development tools.

Whether you’re submitting a small bug fix or proposing a major feature, your contributions help advance a critical testing infrastructure used across Google and many open-source projects.

## Getting Started as a Contributor

### Understand the Project

1. **Familiarize Yourself with GoogleTest:** Start by reading the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) to get comfortable with the framework’s basics.
2. **Explore the Codebase:** Review the source code on GitHub: [google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
3. **Check the Documentation:** Helpful documentation locations include the top-level [docs](https://google.github.io/googletest/) directory and community-created docs listed in the [Community Documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/community_created_documentation.html) page.

### Find Something to Work On

- Review the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) for open bugs or feature requests.
- Browse open discussions or feature requests tagged for newcomers.
- Improve or update documentation if you prefer not to dive into code initially.

<Tip>
Starting with small, focused changes smooths the onboarding process and helps you gain confidence with the contribution workflow.
</Tip>

### Set Up Your Development Environment

- Clone the repository and install dependencies as per the [Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html).
- Use CMake or Bazel to build both GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Run existing tests with `ctest` or your build system to validate your environment.

## Contributing Code

### Follow the Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository:** Work on your own copy.
2. **Make Meaningful Commits:** Write clear, focused commit messages describing your changes.
3. **Adhere to the Coding Style:** Follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) used by the project.
4. **Add or Update Tests:** Ensure new features and bug fixes include appropriate unit tests to maintain high coverage.
5. **Run All Tests:** Verify your changes do not break existing functionality.
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Explain the intent and impact of your changes clearly.

### Best Practices for Pull Requests

- Break large changes into smaller, reviewable PRs.
- Reference related issues or documentation where relevant.
- Be responsive to review feedback with updates or clarifications.

<Tip>
Include example code snippets or test results that demonstrate the effect of your changes to assist reviewers.
</Tip>

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Avoid breaking backward compatibility without a clear deprecation plan.
- Do not introduce complex dependencies not aligned with the project’s goals.
- Refrain from broad refactoring unless it significantly improves maintainability.
