# Advanced Mocking: Questions & Pitfalls

This page delves into advanced GoogleMock scenarios, tackling complex mocking problems like mocking unusual method signatures, handling strictness modes, and mastering actions, matchers, and cardinality nuances. It addresses common confusions users face and offers best practices to ensure robust, maintainable mock-based tests.

## Frequently Asked Questions on Advanced Mocking

### 1. How do I properly mock methods with unusual or complex signatures?

- **Problem:** Methods with return types or parameters containing commas (like `std::pair` or containers) cause `MOCK_METHOD` parsing errors.
- **Solution:** Enclose the return type or argument types containing commas in parentheses or use `using` aliases to wrap the complex types.

```cpp
class MyMock {
 public:
  // Wrapping with parentheses to handle commas:
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool));

  // Or using type aliases:
  using BoolAndInt = std::pair<bool, int>;
  MOCK_METHOD(BoolAndInt, GetPair, ());
  using MapIntDouble = std::map<int, double>;
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, (MapIntDouble, bool));
};
```

- Remember to always place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public:` section, regardless of access in the base class.

### 2. How do strictness modes (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`) affect uninteresting calls?

- **NaggyMock (default behavior):** Prints warnings on uninteresting calls (calls to mock methods without expectations).
- **NiceMock:** Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls, making tests less noisy.
- **StrictMock:** Treats uninteresting calls as errors, causing test failures.

**Usage example:**

```cpp
// Naggy mock (default) - warns on unexpected calls.
NaggyMock<MyMock> naggy_mock;

// Nice mock - suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
NiceMock<MyMock> nice_mock;

// Strict mock - fails tests on uninteresting calls.
StrictMock<MyMock> strict_mock;
```

**Important caveats:**
- Strictness wrappers only affect mock methods defined *directly* via `MOCK_METHOD` in the mock class.
- Avoid nesting strictness wrappers (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<...>>`) as it is unsupported.
- Mock destructors should be virtual for predictable behavior.

### 3. What is the difference between `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL`, and when should I use which?

- `EXPECT_CALL` sets an expectation: it specifies that a method will be called with certain arguments and how often. It also defines the mock's behavior for those calls.
- `ON_CALL` sets the default behavior for a method but does **not** expect it to be called.

**Best practice:**
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify common default behaviors, especially in test fixture setup.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to verify the exact calls that your test cares about.

**Example:**

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(_)).WillByDefault(Return(0));  // Default action
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(5)).Times(1);             // Expect Foo(5) to be called once
```

Suppress warnings about uninteresting calls with either a `NiceMock` or a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### 4. How do I control the order of expected calls?

- Use `InSequence` scope for strict ordering:

```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, A());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, B());
}
```

- Use `Sequence` objects for partial ordering or complex workflows:

```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, A()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, B()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, C()).InSequence(s2);
```

- Use the `.After()` clause to specify that one expectation must happen after others:

```cpp
Expectation e1 = EXPECT_CALL(mock, InitX());
Expectation e2 = EXPECT_CALL(mock, InitY());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Use()).After(e1, e2);
```

### 5. Why do newer `EXPECT_CALL`s override older ones?

To enable layering of expectations, gMock matches mock calls against expectations in *reverse order*. This lets you specify broad default behaviors first (e.g., in a test fixture) and then more specific overrides later in close-to-test code. 

### 6. What does `.RetiresOnSaturation()` do and when should I use it?

By default, expectations remain active even after reaching their call count limit (sticky expectations). `.RetiresOnSaturation()` causes an expectation to **retire** (become inactive) once its maximum call count is reached, allowing subsequent matching calls to hit other expectations.

**When to use:**
- When setting multiple expectations on the same method with different argument matchers and you want the saturated expectation to stop matching afterward.

**Example:**

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetNumber(_)).Times(AnyNumber());  // Catch-all
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetNumber(7)).Times(2).RetiresOnSaturation();  // Exactly twice
```

Without `.RetiresOnSaturation()`, the third call to `SetNumber(7)` would be an error.

### 7. How do I mock overloaded methods?

Mock all overloads explicitly, ensuring each has correct signature and qualifiers. Use `Const()` when expecting calls to const overloads.

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int x), (override));
MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (double x), (override));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Add(5));
EXPECT_CALL(Const(mock), Add(5.0));
```

To prevent compiler warnings about hidden overloads, bring base class methods into scope:

```cpp
using Base::Add;
```

### 8. How can I test methods that accept or return move-only types like `std::unique_ptr`?

- Recent versions of GoogleMock allow direct mocking of methods with move-only parameters and return types using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- For returning move-only types repeatedly, provide actions using lambdas which create new instances each time.

Example:

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(std::unique_ptr<Foo>, MakeFoo, (), (override));

EXPECT_CALL(mock, MakeFoo())
  .WillRepeatedly([]() { return std::make_unique<Foo>(); });
```

### 9. What's the best way to handle uninteresting calls when using mocks?

- If you do not care about some method calls, do not set any expectation on them.
- GoogleMock will print warnings for such calls unless you:
  - Use a `NiceMock` to suppress warnings globally, or
  - Add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())`.

### 10. How can I debug unexpected or unsatisfied expectations?

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed traces of expectations, matched calls, and mismatches.
- Check the order and argument matchers of your `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- Investigate call ordering if using sequences or `.After`.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Defining `MOCK_METHOD`s outside `public:` section:** This breaks external access needed by `EXPECT_CALL`.
- **Not mocking all overloads:** Leads to hidden method warnings.
- **Over-specifying `EXPECT_CALL`s:** Causes fragile tests that break on internal refactors.
- **Not using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` where needed:** Can cause unexpected duplicate call errors.
- **Using `Return` with move-only types multiple times:** Causes runtime errors; use lambdas instead.

## Best Practices for Advanced Mocking

- Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior setup, `EXPECT_CALL` for precise verification.
- Prefer `NiceMock` for less noisy tests unless strictness is specifically desired.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid expectation stickiness problems.
- Use sequences or `.After()` to precisely control the order of expected calls.
- When mocking complex signatures, typedefs or parentheses avoid parsing errors.
- Delegate to fakes or real objects where complex behavior is needed.
- Use lambdas or callable objects for sophisticated actions, especially with move-only types.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Expectation Not Matching
- Verify that argument matchers correctly describe the expected calls.
- Verify call order constraints (sequences, `.After()`).
- Check for retired expectations that no longer match calls.

### Uninteresting Call Warnings
- Add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());`
- Or use `NiceMock` to globally suppress warnings.

### Mock Object Not Verifying
- Ensure mock objects are properly destroyed to trigger verification.
- Or call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` manually.
- Avoid leaking mock objects unless explicitly allowed.

### Compilation Errors with `MOCK_METHOD`
- For complicated argument or return types with commas, use parentheses wrapping or type aliases.

### Fails due to Strictness Mode
- Switch to `NiceMock` or use catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`s if uninteresting call failures are unintended.

<Tip>
Use `EXPECT_CALL` judiciously to verify only essential interactions, avoiding brittle tests caused by over-specification.
</Tip>

<Note>
Leverage `NiceMock` to reduce warning noise for uninteresting calls when you don’t care about strict call verification.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never mix strictness wrappers on mock hierarchies that already use them; this leads to undefined behavior.
</Warning>

<Check>
Always place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the public section of your mock class, even if the original method is protected or private.
</Check>
