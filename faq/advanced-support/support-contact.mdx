# Where can I get further help and find the community?

When working with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, you may sometimes need additional help, want to report issues, or contribute to the project. This page provides recommended venues and guidelines for obtaining support, reporting bugs, engaging with the community, and contributing to the project.

---

## Official Documentation

Your first and most reliable resource is the official documentation available at:

- [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/)
- [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)
- [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html)
- [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html)

These documents offer comprehensive information on everything from basic usage to advanced techniques.

## GitHub Issues

If you believe you have encountered a bug, or wish to request a feature, the best way to communicate with the developers is through the [GitHub Issues on the googletest repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).

**Guidelines for reporting issues:**

- Clearly describe the problem and how to reproduce it.
- Provide details about your environment including platform, compiler version, and GoogleTest/GoogleMock version.
- Include a minimal example if possible.
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

Remember, maintainers may not be able to provide help for usage questions here; instead, use community forums or other channels.

## Community Forums and Q&A Sites

You can seek help and share knowledge in community-driven forums, including:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) with the `googletest` tag.
- [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/googlemock)

Community forums are great for:

- Troubleshooting errors and clarifying expected behaviors.
- Discussing best practices.
- Sharing use cases or custom extensions.

When posting questions, provide clear context, code snippets, and what you have tried so far.

## Chat and Real-time Support

Although GoogleTest and GoogleMock do not maintain an official live chat for support, some user communities exist on platforms like Slack, Discord, or IRC where developers discuss testing frameworks. Check your organization's developer network or third-party groups for such channels.

## Contribution Guidelines

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open-source projects welcoming contributions. Before submitting code, please:

- Review the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Follow the coding style and test requirements.
- Submit Pull Requests through GitHub with clear descriptions of changes.

Contributions can be valuable improvements, bug fixes, new tests, or documentation enhancements.

## Support Limits and Expectations

While we strive to support users widely, please keep in mind:

- The project is maintained by a volunteer or small team; response times can vary.
- The team focuses on issues and improvements that benefit the broader user base.
- Usage questions are better suited for community forums rather than direct issue reports.
- Please use existing documentation first, as many common questions have been answered.
