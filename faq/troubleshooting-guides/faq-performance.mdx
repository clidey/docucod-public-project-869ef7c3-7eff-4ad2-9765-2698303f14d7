# How Can I Optimize Test Performance and Suite Execution Time?

Optimizing the performance and execution time of your test suites is essential to maintain fast feedback loops, ensure efficient use of resources, and promote scalable test practices. This guide provides actionable strategies tailored for GoogleTest and GoogleMock users, helping you speed up tests without sacrificing reliability or coverage.

---

## 1. Parallelize Test Execution

Modern test frameworks and build environments offer multiple ways to run tests concurrently, dramatically reducing total test suite time.

### Use Built-in Parallel Runners
- **GoogleTestâ€™s `--jobs` flag**: If supported by your environment, use the `--jobs=N` option to run tests in parallel, where `N` is the number of simultaneous test jobs.

### Utilize Build System Parallelism
- Integrate with build tools like **Bazel** or **CMake** which support parallel test execution leveraging multiple cores.

### Isolate Tests for Parallelism
- Ensure tests do not share mutable global state or perform conflicting operations on shared resources.
- Use GoogleTest's **test fixtures** carefully to avoid data races.

### Platform-Specific Runners
- Explore platform-specific test runner integrations (see the [Test Runner Integration guide](/api-reference/platform-configuration-and-internals/test-runner-integration)) to unlock platform parallelism nuances.


## 2. Write Efficient Mocks

Mocks can significantly accelerate tests by avoiding costly external dependencies.

### Avoid Overly Complex Mock Setups
- Keep mock expectations and actions minimal and focused to prevent overhead.

### Prefer `ON_CALL` for Defaults
- Use `ON_CALL` to define default mock behaviors that apply broadly, reducing verbosity.

### Use `NiceMock` to Suppress Uninteresting Call Overhead
- Wrapping mocks with `NiceMock<T>` reduces warnings on unexpected method calls and can improve test clarity and performance.

### Carefully Scope `EXPECT_CALL`
- Set expectations only when you actually need to verify calls, helping decrease runtime checks.

### Release Resources Promptly
- Allow mocks to be destructed promptly after test execution to verify expectations early and avoid leaks.

### Use Delegation Patterns
- Delegate to fakes or real objects inside mocks if appropriate to minimize manual mock behavior complexity.


## 3. Minimize Slow Paths in Tested Code

Sometimes the tested code includes slow operations that impact test speed.

### Stub Expensive Operations
- Use mocks and fakes to stub out database calls, file I/O, network access, or complex computations.

### Use Conditional Logic in Mocks
- Use argument matchers and sequences to trigger slower behaviors only when explicitly tested.

### Profile and Identify Bottlenecks
- Use profiling tools on tests to detect slow setup or execution paths, then refactor or mock them.


## 4. Leverage Available Environment Options and Flags

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide flags and environment options to aid performance tuning.

| Flag or Option               | Purpose                                       | Usage Example                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `--gmock_verbose`            | Controls mock output verbosity and overhead. | `--gmock_verbose=error`            |
| `--gtest_repeat`             | Repeat tests to catch flakes.                  | `--gtest_repeat=10`                |
| `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` | Verify mock usage early without destruction. | Call programmatically in tests.   |
| `Mock::AllowLeak()`          | Tell GoogleMock to ignore mock leak checks.   | Use for long-lived mocks (sparingly). |


## 5. Best Practices for Test Suite Maintenance

### Design for Fast Startup
- Avoid heavy global/static initialization that slows your entire test click.

### Keep Tests Small and Focused
- Write short, single-concern tests to reduce setup and teardown cost.

### Use Parameterized or Typed Tests
- Reuse test logic efficiently without duplicating code.

### Limit Output When Not Debugging
- Excess console output can slow down tests. Use flags or mocks verbosity levels.


## 6. Troubleshooting Common Performance Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Performance Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Running Slowly Due to Serial Execution">
**Issue:** All tests running one after another causes slow total suite times.

**Solution:** Ensure you are using the `--jobs` flag or test runner that supports parallelism. Check for shared state that prevents safe concurrency.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mocks Causing Slowdowns">
**Issue:** Complex expectations or overly strict ordering

**Solution:** Simplify expectations where possible. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to let expectations retire sooner and minimize costly matching.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow Initialization or Teardown">
**Issue:** Tests spend most time in setup/teardown logic.

**Solution:** Profile test fixture setup and global initialization. Extract slow code into shared setup to reduce repetition.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Uninteresting Call Warnings">
**Issue:** Excessive warnings from uninteresting mock calls clutter output and waste time.

**Solution:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress such warnings, or explicitly set expectations if calls are expected.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 7. Summary

Improving test performance is about combining parallel execution, efficient mocks, and avoiding slow code paths. Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock features proactively, write focused tests, and leverage environment options to maintain high productivity and fast feedback loops.

## Example: Speeding Up Mock Verification

```cpp
using ::testing::Mock;

TEST(SomeTest, VerifyEarly) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething()).Times(1);

  // Exercise code that calls mock.DoSomething()

  // Verify before destruction to catch failures early.
  ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
}
```

## Example: Simple Parallel Test Execution Invocation

```bash
./my_tests --jobs=4
```

This will run the tests using 4 jobs in parallel, reducing total wall-clock time.
