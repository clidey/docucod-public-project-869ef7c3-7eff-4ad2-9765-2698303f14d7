# Reporting Issues & Getting Support

GoogleTest is an open-source C++ testing framework with a vibrant community and active maintainers committed to improving the product. This page provides clear instructions on how you can effectively report bugs, submit feature requests, and engage with the maintainers to get the support you need.

---

## 1. Where to Report Issues

All bugs, feature requests, and support questions related to GoogleTest are handled on the project's GitHub repository. This centralized issue tracker helps maintainers prioritize work and ensures transparency.

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - URL: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)
  - Before creating a new issue, browse existing issues to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported.
  - Use descriptive titles and provide all relevant details.


## 2. How to Report Bugs Effectively

Clear, actionable bug reports accelerate diagnosis and resolution. When reporting a bug:

- **Describe the Problem:**
  - Summarize what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
  - Specify whether the issue occurs consistently or intermittently.

- **Environment Details:**
  - Provide the GoogleTest version (preferably the commit hash or the release tag).
  - Include your operating system and version.
  - Detail the compiler and version you are using.
  - Mention any special platform details (e.g., Windows, Linux distro, macOS). 

- **Reproduction Steps:**
  - Share a minimal but complete code example that reproduces the issue.
  - Include commands you run, flags passed to testing programs, and the precise output.

- **Additional Logs or Output:**
  - Paste failure messages or error text exactly.
  - If applicable, attach XML or JSON output generated (e.g., via `--gtest_output`).

- **Attempted Workarounds:**
  - Mention any workarounds you tried and their outcomes.


## 3. Submitting Feature Requests

Feature requests should include:

- A **clear description** of the feature and the problem it solves.
- The **use case or scenario** where the feature would add value.
- Any **proposed API or usage pattern ideas** if you have suggestions.

Maintain a respectful tone and be open to discussion. Not all requests can be implemented, but valuable requests are considered seriously.


## 4. Guidelines for Engaging with Maintainers

- **Be concise but complete:** Provide enough information but avoid unnecessarily long reports.
- **Use the issue template:** GitHub provides issue templates guiding you to provide needed information.
- **Stay on-topic:** Keep discussions focused on the reported issue.
- **Be patient:** Maintainers often work on GoogleTest voluntarily or alongside many priorities.
- **Participate in discussion:** Respond promptly to requests for clarification.


## 5. Before Posting: Use Available Resources

To reduce redundant issues and get faster answers, use these resources:

- **Official Documentation:** Review the [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) and the [FAQ & Common Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/getting-started/troubleshooting-help/faq-common-issues.md).
- **Troubleshooting Guides:** Explore detailed guides on common errors and platform compatibility.
- **Community Help Channels:** Join the GoogleTest mailing list or GitHub Discussions for peer support.


## 6. How to Ask for Support

For support questions or general usage help:

- Use GoogleTest's **official community channels** such as the GitHub Discussions or mailing lists.
- Provide detailed description of your environment, what you tried, and the problem behavior.
- Avoid posting support requests as GitHub issues; those are reserved for actionable bugs and feature work.


## 7. Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in GoogleTest, please report it privately via the email address listed in the project README or the designated security contact, instead of posting it publicly.


## 8. Additional Tips for Effective Communication

- Include snippets of **relevant code** (e.g., test definitions, custom assertions).
- Share your **build system or integration details** if the issue relates to test discovery or linking.
- Provide **configurations** such as command-line flags used (e.g., `--gtest_filter`, `--gtest_repeat`).
- Report **unexpected test failures** with exact test names and output.


## 9. Example Issue Template

---
**Title:** Clearly state bug or feature request

**Description:**

*Expected behavior:* Describe what you expect.

*Actual behavior:* Describe what actually happens.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
```cpp
// Minimum reproducible code snippet
```

**Environment:**
- GoogleTest version: tag or commit SHA
- OS and version:
- Compiler and version:
- Build system:
- Flags passed to test executable:

**Additional info:**
Any other information, logs, or context.

## Getting Started With Support

If you are new to GoogleTest and want to ask for help, please first try to enable detailed output by:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_brief=0 --gtest_print_time=1
```

And share the exact commands you used plus the output.

This helps pinpoint whether your issue is environmental, integration, or usage-related.
