## 1. Where can I find official documentation for GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

The best place to start is the official documentation hosted on the GoogleTest site and GitHub repository:

- **gMock Cookbook**: Offers practical recipes and usage patterns for mocking. It is a comprehensive guide that covers from basic mock class definitions to advanced matchers and actions. [Read the gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)

- **Mocking Reference**: Detailed reference about the mocking API, macros, classes, and usage patterns. [Read the Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html)

- **Legacy gMock FAQ**: Answers to common questions and troubleshooting from the community. [Read the FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html)

- **gMock Cheat Sheet**: A handy quick reference for defining mocks and using common features. [Access the Cheat Sheet](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cheat_sheet.html)

These documents collectively cover mock creation, expectations, matchers, actions, cardinalities, sequences, and strictness modes.
