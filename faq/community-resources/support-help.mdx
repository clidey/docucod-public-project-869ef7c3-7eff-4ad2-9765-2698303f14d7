# Seeking Help and Reporting Issues

This page guides users on how to obtain support for GoogleTest-related problems, including reporting bugs effectively, accessing community resources, and understanding best practices to ensure timely and useful resolutions.

---

## 1. Where to Get Help

GoogleTest is an open-source project with active community support and official maintenance. If you encounter issues, here are your best avenues for assistance:

### a. Official Documentation

Before seeking help, consult the [GoogleTest User's Guide](../docs/index.md). It covers various usage scenarios and troubleshooting tips.

### b. GitHub Issues

The primary channel for reporting bugs, requesting features, or tracking existing problems is the [GoogleTest GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).

- Search for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Use descriptive titles and provide detailed information.
- Include platform, compiler version, GoogleTest version, and reproduction steps.

### c. Community Forums and Mailing Lists

While GoogleTest does not maintain official forums, developers often discuss usage and troubleshooting at:

- Stack Overflow under the [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) tag.
- Relevant C++ user groups and open source mailing lists.

### d. Internal Support Policies

If you are part of an organization using GoogleTest internally, check with your tools or platform teams for internal support channels.

## 2. Preparing an Effective Issue Report

To help maintainers diagnose and resolve problems efficiently, structure your issues clearly:

### What to Include

- **Environment details:** OS, platform architecture, compiler name and version, C++ standard used.
- **GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions:** Commit SHA or release version.
- **Build system and configuration:** Are you using CMake, Bazel, or something else? Include relevant snippets.
- **Minimal, reproducible code sample:** A short test case or snippet demonstrating the problem.
- **Exact error messages and logs:** Include full output, stack traces, or error codes.
- **Steps to reproduce:** What commands do you run? What sequence triggers the issue?

### What to Avoid

- Attaching large binaries or proprietary code.
- Vague descriptions like "It doesn't work".
- Issues that have been resolved in newer versions (check changelogs first).

## 3. Troubleshooting Basics Prior to Asking

Sometimes problems originate in local environments or misconfigurations. Before reaching out:

- **Verify prerequisites and compiler compatibility:** See [Prerequisites and System Requirements](../../getting-started/essentials/prerequisites-requirements).
- **Ensure correct installation:** Follow [Installation on Major Platforms](../../getting-started/essentials/installation-platforms).
- **Check your test and mock definitions:** Refer to the [Mocking Basics guide](../../guides/getting-started-workflows/mocking-basics) and [Writing and Running Your First Test](../../guides/getting-started-workflows/writing-your-first-test).
- **Run sample tests:** Use the provided [First Successful Test walkthrough](../../getting-started/first-run-validation/first-successful-test) to confirm the environment.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Support Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Essentials">
<Accordion title="I get compilation or linking errors when building tests.">
Review [Build, Linking, and Compiler Issues FAQ](/faq/troubleshooting-optimization/build-link-errors) for troubleshooting linking errors, C++ standard compatibility, and platform specifics.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock expectations are not verified as expected.">
Ensure all expectations are set *before* the code under test runs. See [Using Mocks in Tests](../../docs/gmock_for_dummies.md#using-mocks-in-tests) and [Mocking Basics](../../guides/getting-started-workflows/mocking-basics) for correct mock usage patterns.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests fail but I can't figure out why.">
Increase verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info` flag and consult [Test Failures and Diagnostics FAQ](/faq/troubleshooting-optimization/test-failures-debug) for interpreting failure outputs.
</Accordion>
