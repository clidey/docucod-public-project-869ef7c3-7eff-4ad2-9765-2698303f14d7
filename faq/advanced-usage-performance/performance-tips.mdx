# How can I improve the performance of my test suite?

Improving the performance of your test suite is essential as your codebase grows larger and testing demands become more complex. Slow tests can hinder quick feedback loops, decrease productivity, and slow down continuous integration pipelines. This guide provides actionable advice to help you reduce test runtime, leverage parallel execution, and apply best practices for efficient test authoring.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Performance Challenges

As your project matures, it’s common to encounter:

- **Long-running test executions** that delay developer feedback.
- **Resource contention** from sequential or single-threaded test runs.
- **Brittle or inefficient tests** that do more work than necessary or depend on external resources.

Identifying these causes early can guide you towards solutions focused on optimizing your test suite without sacrificing quality.

---

## 2. Strategies to Reduce Test Runtime

### 2.1 Filter and Focus Your Tests

- **Run only tests relevant to your current changes** using test filters (e.g., GoogleTest’s `--gtest_filter=`).
- **Disable particularly slow or flaky tests** during local iterative development to maintain fast feedback.

<Tip>
Use selective test execution to speed up incremental testing; don’t run the entire suite every time unless necessary.
</Tip>

### 2.2 Disable or Stub Expensive Operations

- Use **mock objects** to replace slow dependencies like databases, network calls, or file I/O.
- Prefer **fakes** or lightweight implementations over real resources when full correctness isn’t necessary.

Refer to [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) and the [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html) to learn about designing mocks that improve speed.

### 2.3 Optimize Test Initialization and Teardown

- Avoid expensive setup and teardown in each test when possible by using test fixtures effectively.
- Reuse expensive resources across multiple tests but isolate test state to avoid flakiness.

### 2.4 Use Efficient Matchers and Assertions

- Use lightweight matchers and avoid overly complex checks inside test code.
- Keep assertions focused and meaningful to minimize test execution time.

See the [Mastering Assertions and Matchers guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/core-workflows/effective-assertions.html) for details.

## 3. Leveraging Parallel Test Execution

Modern test runners support parallelizing test executions across CPU cores or machines. GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer mechanisms to enable this.

### 3.1 Using GoogleTest Parallel Test Runner

- Run tests concurrently by leveraging tools such as `gtest-parallel` or native test sharding.
- Configure test jobs to run on different subsets of the test suite using environment variables or command-line flags.

### 3.2 Utilizing Test Sharding

- Shard your test suite among multiple parallel jobs, each running a portion of the tests.
- Use the `--gtest_shard_index` and `--gtest_shards` flags to split tests.

```bash
// Run shard 0 of 4
./my_test_binary --gtest_shard_index=0 --gtest_shards=4
```

### 3.3 Best Practices for Parallel Runs

- **Design tests to be independent and isolated**; avoid shared state.
- Use **mocking and stubbing** to prevent interference caused by shared resources.
- If tests are flaky or fail under parallelism, diagnose and refactor to improve reliability.

### 3.4 Continuous Integration Integration

- Configure your CI environment to run multiple shards or runner instances in parallel.
- Aggregate results to reflect the overall test status.

## 4. Best Practices for Efficient Test Authoring

Efficiency begins with writing tests that are easy to run, reliable, and maintain without unnecessary overhead.

### 4.1 Code Design for Testability

- Use **Dependency Injection** to replace real components with mocks or fakes easily.
- Follow the [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) guide on designing interfaces for mocking.

### 4.2 Manage Expectations and Interactions Carefully

- Use `EXPECT_CALL()` and `ON_CALL()` judiciously to only verify behavior critical to your test goals.
- Avoid over-strict expectations that can cause brittle and slow tests.

### 4.3 Use Appropriate Mock Strictness

- Choose between **NiceMock**, **NaggyMock**, and **StrictMock** depending on whether you want to suppress or enforce uninteresting call warnings.
- Excessive strictness can slow tests by producing verbose diagnostics.

See [Strict, Naggy, and Nice Mocks](https://google.github.io/googletest/api/reference/mocking_and_expectations/strict_naggy_nice_mocks.html).

### 4.4 Minimize Heavy Test Data

- Use minimal or representative data sets to test logic without loading huge inputs.
- Reuse data fixtures across tests to reduce setup overhead.

### 4.5 Regularly Profile and Review Your Test Suite

- Use profiling tools to identify slow tests and parts of your test code.
- Address bottlenecks incrementally to avoid regressions.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls Impacting Test Performance">
<Accordion title="Tests depending on external services or resources">
Tests that rely on real external systems (databases, network services) are slow and flaky. Always mock or fake such dependencies for unit tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unnecessary global state or shared resources">
Shared mutable state can cause race conditions and slow down parallel tests. Design tests to be independent and thread-safe.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Overly strict expectations causing breakdowns">
Expectations that are too narrow or numerous increase verification overhead and test fragility. Use 'nice' mocks where appropriate and keep expectations focused.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Running full test suites for every change">
Avoid running the entire suite for small iterative changes by running relevant tests only.
</Accordion>

## 6. Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### 6.1 Detecting Slow Tests

- Use test runners with verbose timing output (e.g., `--gtest_brief=1`).
- Identify slow tests by looking at logs or using profiling tools.

### 6.2 Handling Flaky Tests Under Parallelism

- Verify isolation of test cases.
- Check for race conditions or shared external dependencies.

### 6.3 Diagnosing Unexpected Mock Call Failures

- Run tests with increased gMock verbosity using `--gmock_verbose=info`.
- Analyze reported mismatches to fine-tune expectations and interactions.

Refer to the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html) for additional tips on debugging mock expectations.
