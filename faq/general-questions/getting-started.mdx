# How do I get started with GoogleTest?

Welcome to your first step in mastering GoogleTest! This guide will walk you through the essential resources and practical steps to start writing and running C++ tests with GoogleTest, minimizing friction and accelerating your learning curve.

---

## 1. Begin with the GoogleTest Primer

The [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) is your perfect starting point. It concisely explains:

- **Why GoogleTest?** Understand the core values like test independence, portability, and fast execution.
- **Basic Concepts:** Learn key ideas such as assertions, tests, test suites, and fixtures.
- **Writing Simple Tests:** See how to define tests with `TEST()` macros and grouping in suites.
- **Test Fixtures:** Reuse common setup across multiple tests using `TEST_F()`.
- **Running Tests:** How to invoke tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` efficiently.

### Example from the Primer:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}
```

This primer not only teaches you the concepts, but also demonstrates best practices that ensure your tests are well-structured and maintainable.

## 2. Explore the Core Macros and APIs Reference

Once comfortable with the primer, move on to the detailed [Testing Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/testing.md). Key topics include:

- **`TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P` macros:** How to define basic, fixture-based, and parameterized tests.
- **Test Suite Instantiation:** How to use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for parameterized tests.
- **Test Initialization and Skipping:** Control flow macros like `GTEST_SKIP()`.
- **Running Tests:** `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and `InitGoogleTest()` functions.

This reference ensures you have the full API portrait at your fingertips, empowering you to write tests that fit your needsâ€”from simple validations to advanced parameterized scenarios.

---

## 3. Utilize Existing Samples for Practical Understanding

The [Googletest Samples](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/samples.md) demonstrate realistic test code illustrating:

- Basic function testing
- Class member function testing with fixtures
- Type-parameterized and value-parameterized tests
- Use of listeners and advanced test customization

These samples act as code templates you can adapt directly in your projects.

---

## 4. Run Tests Using Default Main or Customize Your `main()`

GoogleTest provides default entry points to run your tests easily:

- Link your test suite with the `gtest_main` library, which includes a ready-made `main()` routine.
- If you require custom test initialization, the [Writing the main() Function](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md#writing-the-main-function) section in the primer shows you how to create and use your own `main()` function, enabling precise control over setup and teardown.

Example snippet from the primer:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

---

## 5. Tips for Smooth Onboarding

- **Naming Conventions:** Follow the recommended naming styles for test suites and tests (no underscores, PascalCase) for compatibility and clarity.
- **Test Independence:** Keep tests isolated; GoogleTest enforces this but design your fixtures carefully to avoid shared mutable state.
- **Use Assertions Wisely:** Choose `EXPECT_` for non-fatal checks that allow multiple failures, and `ASSERT_` when test continuation after failure doesn't make sense.

## 6. Next Steps and Related Resources

- To learn how to set up and build tests within your project, see the [Setup-Build Integration Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/guides/getting-started/setup-build-integration.md).
- For writing your first unit tests using GoogleMock as well, refer to [Writing Your First Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-tests.md).

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

If you face issues such as tests not running or build problems, consult these pages:

- [Troubleshooting & Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting.md)
- [Why are my tests not running or being discovered?](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/faq/troubleshooting/test-not-running.md) (FAQ)

---

## Summary
Starting with GoogleTest is designed to be quick and intuitive. By studying the Primer for foundational concepts, exploring the detailed APIs when ready, and leveraging samples for direct code examples, you will quickly be able to write, organize, and run robust C++ tests. Using built-in runners or customizing `main()` as needed ensures flexible integration into your workflow.
