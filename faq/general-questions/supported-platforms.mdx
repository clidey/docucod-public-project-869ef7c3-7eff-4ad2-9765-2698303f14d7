# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

This page details the officially supported platforms, compilers, and environment prerequisites for building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. It answers common questions regarding compatibility, minimum requirements, and environment setup considerations to ensure successful integration of the testing frameworks.

---

## Supported Platforms Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock maintain broad compatibility across diverse operating systems and platforms, aligned with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).

- **Primary supported platforms include:**
  - Linux (including distributions with glibc and Android)
  - macOS
  - Windows (Desktop, MinGW)
  - BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly)
  - Other UNIX-like systems (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX)

- **Embedded and specialized platforms:**
  - Partial support for platforms such as Native Client, Fuchsia, and RTOSes (e.g., QNX, Haiku)
  - Limited or no support for mobile-only platforms like Windows Mobile or Windows Phone

For a detailed, continually updated matrix, see the official table at [Google OSS Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Compiler Support and Minimum Requirements

- **C++ Standard:** GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports at least **C++17**. You must ensure your build environment enforces this (e.g., via `-std=c++17` or equivalent).

- **Compiler Compatibility:** Supported compilers include:
  - GCC (versions supporting C++17)
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later
  - IntelLLVM compiler
  - SunPro, IBM XL, and other professional compilers with C++17 support

- **Exceptions and RTTI:**
  - GoogleTest auto-detects availability of C++ exceptions and RTTI support.
  - It can be configured to build without exceptions or RTTI if needed by setting appropriate compiler flags and macros.

- **Thread Support:**
  - GoogleTest uses native threading libraries when available.
  - `pthread` support is enabled on Linux, macOS, BSDs, and others.
  - For Windows, native Windows threading APIs are used. MinGW support for pthreads is not used due to conformance limits.

---

## Environment Dependencies

- **Threading Libraries:** Must have support for pthreads (or native Windows threads) for thread-safe test execution.
- **Filesystem:** GoogleTest requires basic filesystem capabilities for features like death tests.
- **Regular Expressions:** Supports different regex backends depending on platform:
  - RE2 library when compiled with Abseil
  - POSIX extended regex on UNIX-like platforms with full regex support
  - A built-in simple regex as a fallback

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **Windows:**
  - Supports Desktop and MinGW environments.
  - Must take care to configure dynamic vs static CRT linkage to avoid linker errors.
  - Microsoft Structured Exception Handling (SEH) is supported.

- **Linux:**
  - Full support including Android (partial, depending on API level).
  - Clone(2) syscall support is required for certain internal operations and is available except on some architectures.

- **macOS and iOS:**
  - Fully supported with macOS providing a standard UNIX-like environment.
  - iOS is detected but has limited feature support.

- **Other UNIX variants:**
  - Basic support with varying levels of feature completeness.

---

## Build System Compatibility

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide community-supported build scripts for:
  - **CMake:** Recommended for most platforms.
    - Requires CMake version 3.13 or newer.
    - Supports building as static or shared libraries.
    - Thread library discovery and flags are configured automatically.
  - **Bazel:** Official build configuration maintained.

- The build scripts automatically select appropriate compiler flags, threading support, and platform macros.

## Installing and Using GoogleTest on Supported Platforms

### 1. Ensure C++17 Standard

Set your compiler flags to require C++17. For example, with CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

### 2. Select Compiler Supported on Your Platform

Verify that you use a compiler version compatible with GoogleTest:
- MSVC 2017 Update 3 or later
- GCC >= 7.0
- Clang latest stable

### 3. Configure Build System

- Use provided CMakeLists.txt to build GoogleTest.
- Enable or disable GoogleMock as desired.
- Use `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries to simplify test executable setup.

### 4. Link Your Tests Against GoogleTest Libraries

### 5. Run Tests on Target Platform

Test binaries built by GoogleTest support native execution on the target platform.

## Common Questions About Supported Platforms

<AccordionGroup title="Frequently Asked Questions">
<Accordion title="Can I use GoogleTest on embedded or mobile platforms?">
GoogleTest supports many desktop and server platforms primarily. Embedded platforms and mobile OS variants like Windows Mobile have limited or no support, especially for features dependent on a full file system or threading.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is C++17 mandatory for GoogleTest?">
Yes. GoogleTest requires C++17 features for compilation and runtime behavior. Prior standards are not supported.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does GoogleTest support building as shared libraries (DLL)?">
Yes. You can build GoogleTest and GoogleMock as shared libraries by defining the flag `DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`. Corresponding flags must be set when linking tests that use these shared libraries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are exceptions and RTTI required?">
Not strictly. GoogleTest can be built with exceptions or RTTI disabled, if necessary, by defining macros and compiler flags appropriately. However, this may limit certain features.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What platforms are not supported or have unstable support?">
Less common operating systems like OS/2, Fuchsia, Haiku, GNU/Hurd, or specialized embedded platforms have experimental or no official stable support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Platform Compatibility

<Tip>
If you experience build failures related to platform detection or missing features:
- Verify that your compiler is compatible and configured for C++17.
- Check that necessary system libraries such as pthreads are installed.
- Ensure correct platform macros are defined or overridden only if necessary.
- Consult the GoogleTest build logs for feature detection outputs.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not assume full support on experimental or non-mainstream platforms. GoogleTest community support may be limited for such cases.
</Warning>
