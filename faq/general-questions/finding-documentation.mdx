## Online Hosted Documentation

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide an extensive suite of online documentation hosted by Google. This includes user guides, API references, conceptual overviews, and practical how-tos.

- **Main Website:** The primary user interface for GoogleTest documentation, including guides and references, can be found at:

  - [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/)

- The documentation is organized to help you at every stage, from getting started to advanced mocking techniques.


## Available Guides and References

The hosted documentation includes the following key resources:

- **Getting Started Guides:** Learn how to set up, build, and run your first tests and mocks.
- **Core Workflows:** Deep dives into assertions, mocking, parameterized tests, and typed tests.
- **Advanced Patterns:** Best practices and optimization for large and complex test suites.
- **API References:** Detailed descriptions of matchers, actions, assertions, mock creation, and platform integration.
- **Conceptual Overviews:** Understand the underlying architecture, testing terminologies, portability, and extensibility.
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting:** Answers to common questions and solutions for common setup or execution issues.


## In-Repository Documentation

Apart from hosted documentation, the GoogleTest git repository contains valuable markdown files and code comments that serve as extended documentation and cookbooks:

- `/docs/` — contains guides like the [gMock Cookbook](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md), [gMock for Dummies](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md), and other reference docs.
- `/googlemock/include/gmock/` — the header files include detailed comments explaining macros, classes, and internal APIs.
- `/googlemock/test/` — test files serve as living documentation with examples and syntax verification.


### Practical Tips

- Clone the repository to explore the `/docs/` folder locally for offline reference and advanced recipes.
- Many markdown files link back to related docs for progressive mastery—reading related guides enhances understanding.
