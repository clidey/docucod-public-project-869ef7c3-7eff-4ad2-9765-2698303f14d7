# Where can I get support or ask questions?

Navigating challenges or troubleshooting advanced and unique scenarios with GoogleTest and GoogleMock is easier when you know where to find help and community resources. This page provides a comprehensive overview of official documentation, communication channels, community forums, and third-party tools that extend the GoogleTest framework.

## Official Documentation

The best place to start is with the extensive and detailed documentation provided by the GoogleTest project itself. It covers all major topics and use cases:

- **Core Documentation:**
  - [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/index.md) — foundational understanding including writing tests, fixtures, and assertions.
  - [GoogleMock Cookbook](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md) — practical recipes for advanced mocking techniques.
  - [Mocking Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/mocking.md) — detailed API reference and macros for mocking.
  - [gMock FAQ](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_faq.md) — answers to frequently encountered questions and troubleshooting.
  - [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) — beginner-friendly introduction to writing tests.

- **Usage Guides and Best Practices:**
  - Guides for integrating mocking, writing custom assertions, and organizing complex tests are available in the [Guides section](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/guides).

- **Reference pages:**
  - Actions, matchers, assertions, and diagnostic controls are explained in their respective [reference documents](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/reference).


## Communication Channels and Community Support

Engaging with the community and developers can provide timely help, advice, and shared experiences.

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - The [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) is the official location for filing issues, bug reports, and feature requests. Before posting, it’s recommended to search for existing issues that might answer your question.

- **Google Groups and Mailing Lists:**
  - [googletest-users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/googletest-users) offers a mailing list-style platform where users discuss problems, solutions, and best practices.

- **Stack Overflow:**
  - The [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) and [`google-mock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-mock) tags on Stack Overflow have a large repository of community questions and answers.

- **Chat and IRC:**
  - Though not officially maintained by Google, some community-driven chatrooms like those on Matrix or IRC networks exist where users discuss GoogleTest and mocking topics.

## Third-party Tools, Integrations, and Adapters

Several third-party integrations extend or facilitate the usage of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, helping integrate testing into various development environments:

- **IDE Plugins and Extensions:**
  - Popular IDEs and editors such as Visual Studio Code, CLion, and Visual Studio have extensions/plugins that support running and debugging GoogleTest tests with rich UI.

- **Continuous Integration (CI) Adapters:**
  - Many CI/CD platforms provide native or plug-in support for GoogleTest output formats, enabling test result parsing, reporting, and fail-fast behaviors.

- **Test Reporting Tools:**
  - XML and JUnit-formatted output options allow GoogleTest reports to be consumed by various test dashboards and DevOps tooling.

- **Benchmarking and Profiling Integration:**
  - Tools exist to complement GoogleTest by providing benchmarking or memory profiling linked closely with test runs.

## How to Effectively Use These Resources

When seeking support:

1. **Start with Official Docs:** Read relevant sections of the GoogleTest user guides, FAQs, and API references.
2. **Search Public Archives:** On GitHub issues, mailing lists, and Stack Overflow before creating new posts.
3. **Provide Clear Context:** When asking for help, include minimal reproducible examples, error messages, platform details, and your current configuration.
4. **Engage With the Community:** Participate in Google Groups or Stack Overflow to share knowledge and contribute back.
5. **Contribute Back:** Report issues or improvements you find to help the project stay robust.
