# Performance Optimization & Large Codebases FAQ

This FAQ page provides focused guidance on accelerating test suites, managing test data efficiently, and scaling GoogleTest and GoogleMock for large, slow, or flaky tests. It addresses key techniques such as test parallelization, memory management, and best practices to maintain fast feedback loops especially in CI/CD environments.

## 1. How can I speed up my test suite execution?

To achieve faster test runs:

- **Parallelize Tests:** Use available parallel test execution features, such as running tests concurrently across multiple cores or machines. Tools like `--gtest_parallel` or CI agents configured for parallel jobs increase throughput while ensuring isolated test execution.

- **Reduce Overhead:** Limit expensive global setup or teardown across tests. Instead, prefer per-test fixture setup and teardown to minimize unnecessary initialization.

- **Optimize Mock Usage:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls and reduce diagnostic noise that can slow down output parsing.

- **Selectively Run Tests:** Use filtering (`--gtest_filter`) to run only changed or critical tests during development.

<Tip>
Balancing test coverage and runtime is crucial. Start by optimizing the slowest tests identified by test profiling.
</Tip>

## 2. How can I effectively manage memory usage in large test suites?

Memory consumption can balloon in large codebases. To tackle this:

- **Use Heap Checkers:** Enable heap sanitizers or memory leak detectors to trace leaks, especially for mocks allocated on the heap.

- **Avoid Leaked Mocks:** Be careful to properly delete mock objects or use `Mock::AllowLeak()` intentionally for mocks that persist.

- **Split Large Mock Classes:** Separate complex mock classes into smaller components to reduce compile-time and memory footprint.

- **Minimize Data Copies:** In mock actions and expectations, avoid unnecessary copies of large data structures. Use references and pointers wisely.

- **Optimize Test Fixtures:** Reset or reuse test fixture members to avoid duplicating large setup data.

## 3. What strategies help when tests become flaky or unstable?

- **Isolate External Dependencies:** Use mock objects to stub out flaky external resources such as network or file systems.

- **Control Concurrency:** When testing multithreaded code, serialize test execution or use synchronization primitives to prevent race conditions.

- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` Wisely:** Define stable expectations and default actions to avoid unexpected failures.

- **Manage Invocation Order Strictly:** Use sequences and `.InSequence()` to enforce call ordering where necessary.

- **Enable Verbose Logging:** Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to trace mock calls and identify flaky paths.

## 4. How can I scale GoogleTest/GoogleMock for very large or legacy codebases?

- **Modularize Tests:** Break tests into smaller suites or modules that can be built and run independently.

- **Move Mock Constructors/Destructors to .cc Files:** Define mock class constructors and destructors outside the header to reduce compilation time and memory usage across multiple translation units.

- **Prefer `NiceMock` Over Strict Mocks by Default:** This reduces the volume of warnings and failures introduced unexpectedly during large refactors.

- **Profile Test Build Times and Memory:** Identify and refactor slow test components or oversized mocks.

- **Leverage Typed and Parameterized Tests:** Reduce duplication in tests for multiple implementations or data variants.

- **Avoid Overuse of Complex Matchers or Actions:** Complex matchers and chained actions can cause compiler slowdowns and longer incremental builds.

## 5. How does test parallelization work with GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

- GoogleTest supports running tests in parallel either by separate processes or test shards.
- Each test should be independent and not rely on global or static state.
- Mocks are safe for concurrent use if expectations and usages happen only on single threads within tests.

<Tip>
Do not set or modify expectations on a mock from multiple threads concurrently. Initialize and verify mocks in a single thread to avoid undefined behavior.
</Tip>

## 6. What are best practices for maintaining fast feedback cycles in CI/CD?

- **Run Fast Tests First:** Order tests so speedy, highly deterministic tests run early.
- **Shard Tests:** Divide test runs into shards and distribute across multiple CI nodes.
- **Use Test Caching:** Utilize build and test result caching to avoid repeating unchanged tests.
- **Track and Fix Flaky Tests:** Monitor flaky tests and quarantine them to maintain CI health.
- **Limit Verbose Logging:** Avoid overly verbose test logs except when diagnosing failures.

## 7. How can I interpret and address common performance issues with mocks?

- Large mock classes with many methods increase compile time and memory use.
- Avoid complex action chains; prefer simpler or lambda-based actions where possible.
- Excessive use of `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` with many matchers may slow down matching; optimize matchers to be as simple as possible.
- Use smart default actions (`ON_CALL(...).WillByDefault(...)`) for common behaviors to avoid repetitive expectation matching.

## Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Performance & Scalability Gotchas">
<Accordion title="My test binary takes too long to link or compile">

Consider moving mock class constructor and destructor implementations from header files to dedicated source (.cc) files. This reduces redundant compilation and linking overhead when the mocks are included in many translation units.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My tests produce a flood of uninteresting call warnings">

Switch your mocks from the default (NaggyMock) to `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls and clean up the test output, improving readability and possibly runtime.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test failures due to unexpected or uninteresting calls">

Make sure your `EXPECT_CALL` statements cover all expected calls, or add catch-all expectations with `.Times(AnyNumber())` to gracefully accept unexpected calls to less critical methods.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow test runs due to heavy logging or stack traces">

Use the command-line flag `--gmock_verbose=error` to minimize logging overhead during test runs. Enable verbose output only when debugging.

## Additional Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` appropriately:** `ON_CALL` sets default behaviours without enforcing call counts; `EXPECT_CALL` specifies the expected calls. Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` can lead to brittle tests.
- **Order `EXPECT_CALL`s carefully:** Remember that the last matching expectation takes precedence.
- **Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations once exhausted, preventing unexpected call errors on repeated calls.
- **Leverage `Sequence` and `InSequence` to specify call ordering constraints:** Keeps tests expressive and robust.
