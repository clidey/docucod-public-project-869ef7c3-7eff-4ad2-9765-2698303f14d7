## Official Support Channels

### GitHub Repository

- The primary platform for reporting bugs, feature requests, and contributing code is the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- When reporting issues, clearly describe your environment, steps to reproduce, actual vs. expected behavior, and any relevant logs or code snippets.
- Pull requests are welcome and are the main way for the community to contribute improvements, fixes, and documentation updates.

### Google Groups and Mailing Lists

- While most active discussions occur on GitHub, certain legacy mailing lists or Google Groups may still be referenced for announcements or older threads.

### Issue Tracker Best Practices

- Before opening a new issue, search existing ones to avoid duplicates.
- Provide minimal reproducible examples to speed diagnosis.
- Keep communication clear and avoid speculation; focus on facts.

## Community Forums and Resources

### Stack Overflow

- Tag your questions with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`googlemock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googlemock) for wider community visibility.
- Check existing Q&A for quick resolutions.

### Community-Contributed Tutorials and Blogs

- The GoogleTest ecosystem benefits from community tutorials and blog posts that share best practices and advanced tips.
- Check out curated learning paths like [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) for beginner-friendly introductions.

### Third-Party Integrations

- Some development environments and CI tools provide community plugins or integrations supporting GoogleTest and GoogleMock reporting and execution.

## Additional Documentation Links
