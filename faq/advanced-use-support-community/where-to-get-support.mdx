## Reporting Issues and Suggesting Improvements

If you encounter bugs, unexpected results, or have feature requests, reporting them clearly and effectively helps the project team respond quickly:

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - Use the official GoogleTest GitHub repository issue tracker at: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)
  - When submitting an issue:
    - Provide a detailed description including the environment and steps to reproduce.
