# Mocking and Assertion Usage FAQ

This FAQ clarifies frequently misunderstood aspects of writing mocks, defining custom assertions, and using matchers effectively with GoogleMock and GoogleTest. It aims to help you demystify common errors and pitfalls to author robust, maintainable tests.

## 1. Common Questions about Mocking

### How do I properly define a mock method in my mock class?
Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro inside the `public:` section of your mock class to declare mock methods. It mimics the signature of the virtual method you want to mock, including return type, method name, argument list, and qualifiers like `(const, override)`. 

**Example:**
```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};
```

If your argument types or return type contain commas (e.g., `std::pair<int, int>`), wrap the type in parentheses or use type aliases to avoid macro parsing issues.

### What is the difference between `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL`?
- `EXPECT_CALL` sets an expectation that a mock method *will* be called with specified arguments. It also allows defining behaviors for those calls.
- `ON_CALL` merely defines the default behavior when the mock method is called with the given arguments but does *not* assert or expect that the call will happen.

Prefer `ON_CALL` for default mock behaviors and use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you intend to verify that a call occurs.

### How should I specify argument expectations?
Use **matchers** inside `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` argument lists. The wildcard matcher `_` matches any value. If you want to assert a specific argument, use equality (`Eq(value)`), comparison matcher (`Ge(5)`), or custom matchers.

You can omit argument lists *only* if the method is **not overloaded**.

### How do I control how many times a mock method should be called?
Specify a call count using `.Times()` in `EXPECT_CALL`. For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething()).Times(3);
``` 

Common cardinalities include `AnyNumber()`, `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)`, `Between(m, n)`, and `Exactly(n)`.

If `.Times()` is omitted, GoogleMock infers it based on the number of `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` clauses.

### How can I specify the behavior of mock methods?
Use `.WillOnce(action)` to define the behavior for a single call, and `.WillRepeatedly(action)` for subsequent calls. Actions include `Return(value)`, `ReturnRef(variable)`, invoking a lambda or function, or built-in actions like `SetArgPointee`.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(42))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(0));
```

### What are NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock?
These wrappers control how mocks handle **uninteresting calls** (calls to mock methods without expectations):

- **NiceMock<T>**: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock<T>**: Prints warnings on uninteresting calls (default behavior currently).
- **StrictMock<T>**: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Use them according to your needs for test strictness and warning visibility.

**Example:**
```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
```

## 2. Troubleshooting Common Mocking Issues

### Why does `EXPECT_CALL` sometimes fail with "Actual function call count doesn't match this expectation"?
This happens if the mock method is called fewer or more times than expected, or with arguments that don't match the expectation.

**How to fix:**
- Confirm that the number of calls matches the `.Times()` or inferred cardinality.
- Verify that the arguments satisfy the matchers.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed logs of which calls matched which expectations.

### Why am I seeing warnings about "Uninteresting mock function call"?
A mock function without an expected call was invoked. This is not an error but a warning that you might have forgotten to specify an expectation.

**Resolution options:**
- Add an explicit `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for calls you want to ignore.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress such warnings.
- Adjust verbosity level (`--gmock_verbose`) if desired.

### Why does my mock call invoke the real method instead of the mocked one?
Only **virtual** methods can be mocked by GoogleMock.

Make sure:
- The method you want to mock is declared `virtual` in the base class.
- Your mock class overrides the virtual methods with `MOCK_METHOD` and proper specifiers.

If mocking non-virtual methods, special techniques such as template-based or interface refactoring are required.

### How do I mock overloaded methods?
You must mock each overload explicitly by specifying the exact method signature.
Use `MOCK_METHOD` with the appropriate argument list and qualifiers.

Example:
```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int x), (override));
MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (double x, double y), (override));
```

To disambiguate expectations for overloaded methods in tests, use matchers or explicit casts.

### What is the proper sequence for setting expectations and calling mock methods?
Always set all `EXPECT_CALL()` and `ON_CALL()` statements *before* exercising the code that invokes the mocks.

Setting expectations after invoking mocked methods leads to undefined behavior.

## 3. Using Matchers and Assertions Correctly

### How do I use matchers inside `EXPECT_CALL`?
Matchers specify the conditions mock function arguments should satisfy.

Common patterns:
- Use `_` as a wildcard matcher: matches any value.
- Use `Eq(value)` or simply pass `value` for exact equality.
- Use relational matchers like `Ge`, `Lt`, or logical composition `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`.

You can use `With()` clause to apply a matcher on the combined argument tuple.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(Ge(5), _));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Configure(_)).With(Lt());  // first arg less than second argument
```

### How to validate complex argument properties?
Use custom matchers or utilities like `Field()`, `Property()`, or `Pointee()` to validate object members or pointed-to values.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Field(&MyType::value, Eq(5))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update(Pointee(Ge(10))));
```

### Can I use GoogleTest assertions inside matchers?
Yes, GoogleMock allows `EXPECT_` macros inside custom matchers to produce informative error messages. Use them cautiously to keep matchers functional and pure.

### How can I write custom matchers quickly?
Use the `MATCHER` and `MATCHER_P` macros to define flexible, expressive matchers with minimal code.

Example:
```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "") { return (arg % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetNumber(IsEven()));
```

### How do I write assertions for conditions not covered by built-in macros?
Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` with your desired matcher for unified and descriptive assertions.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

### Always mock interfaces or abstract classes you own.
Avoid mocking classes you do not own; instead, create a wrapping interface or adaptor if needed.

### Set expectations before calling the code under test.
This is crucial so GoogleMock can verify calls as they happen and produce actionable errors.

### Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` for sequential `WillOnce()` expectations to prevent "sticky" expectations causing failures.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

### Use sequences and `InSequence` to enforce call order when necessary.

### Avoid overly strict expectations that make tests brittle.
Use general matchers and `ON_CALL` to define behavior in test fixtures, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for key interaction verifications.

### When mocking methods returning references, use `ReturnRef()`.

### If your mock needs to call real or fake implementations as defaults, delegate via `ON_CALL` behavior overrides.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

### How to debug why an expectation isn't matched?
Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs showing which expectation matched each call.

### What to do if mock expectations lead to heap checker failures?
Verify that your mocked classes have virtual destructors.

### Why do strict mocks cause test failures not seen with nice mocks?
Strict mocks treat *uninteresting* calls as errors. Use strict mocks only when you need to enforce that no unexpected calls happen.

### Why do some expectations cause warnings about too many or too few `WillOnce` actions?
Ensure your number of `WillOnce` actions matches or exceeds your `.Times()` or inferred call count.

### Can I test asynchronous code with mocks?
Yes. Use synchronization primitives with actions to notify test threads when mocked calls occur for deterministic test execution.
