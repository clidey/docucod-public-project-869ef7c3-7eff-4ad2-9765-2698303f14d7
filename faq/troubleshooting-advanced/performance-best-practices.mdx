# Performance & Best Practices

This page addresses common questions and provides guidance on optimizing test execution speed, employing parallel test runners, and adopting best practices for scaling test suites effectively in GoogleTest. It introduces patterns for using value- and type-parameterized tests, minimizing overhead, and leveraging external tools for improved performance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I speed up test execution for large test suites?

To accelerate large test suites, consider:

- **Running tests in parallel:** Distribute tests across multiple CPU cores or machines. GoogleTest itself allows parallelism via external test runners.
- **Sharding tests:** Use sharding flags to split the test suite into subsets which run independently.
- **Reducing test overhead:** Minimize expensive setup and teardown in test fixtures and avoid repeating unnecessary work.
- **Using parameterized tests:** Run a single parameterized test to cover multiple cases efficiently instead of defining many similar tests.

### What is the recommended pattern for writing scalable tests with many parameter variants?

Use:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Define tests that run multiple times with different input data. This avoids code duplication and provides clear grouping.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Useful when the test logic is the same but the tested type varies. Helps maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

These patterns enable concise tests and improved coverage with minimal overhead.

See the [Test Fixtures, Parameterized, and Typed Tests](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/advanced.html#value-and-type-parameterized-tests) guide for details.

### How do I use parallel test runners with GoogleTest?

GoogleTest does not directly provide built-in parallel execution, but it is compatible with several external tools:

- **`gtest-parallel`:** A Python script that launches multiple test processes in parallel and aggregates results.
- **Build system parallelism:** Use CMake, Bazel, or others to run tests concurrently on shards.

Parallel execution is especially valuable for large test suites and significantly reduces wall-clock time.

### How can I minimize the overhead in test setup and teardown?

- Use **test fixtures (TEST_F)** to share setup/teardown between related tests.
- Avoid expensive global initialization inside each test.
- Use **static or lazy initialization** patterns when possible.
- Use **SetUpTestSuite() / TearDownTestSuite()** static methods for expensive operations shared by all tests in a suite.
- Avoid excessive mocking or expensive dependencies when not needed.

### What flags or options help with performance?

- Run tests with **sharding flags**: `--total_shards=N --shard_index=M` to partition tests.
- Use **filtering options** to run only subsets of tests relevant to your change.
- Disable unnecessary logging or use minimal verbosity.
- Preferring **Release builds** over Debug builds will yield faster tests.

### Are there ways to cache or reuse expensive test results?

GoogleTest itself does not provide caching, but users sometimes implement custom caching mechanisms:

- Cache results of expensive computations in static variables or disk-backed caches.
- Use fixturesâ€™ suite-level setup to share expensive ephemeral resources.

This should be done carefully to avoid test flakiness or invalid stale cache usage.

### How do I write test code that helps optimize overall suite performance?

- Write tests that are **independent and isolated** to allow safe parallel execution.
- Keep tests **fast and focused**; avoid testing too many things in one test.
- Limit or avoid **expensive external dependencies** in tests.
- Use **parameterized tests** to avoid many repetitive similar test cases.
- Avoid excessive logging during normal runs; use detailed logs only on failure.

### What external tools complement GoogleTest for performance and scalability?

- **`gtest-parallel`:** Run tests in parallel processes.
- **Bazel or CMake:** Build and run tests concurrently with parallel jobs.
- **Test impact analysis tools:** Run only tests impacted by recent code changes.
- **Coverage tools and profilers:** Identify slow tests and optimize the critical paths.

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### Using Parameterized Tests for Efficiency

- Use value-parameterized tests when the same logic applies to multiple input values.
- Use type-parameterized tests for type-agnostic code.
- This approach reduces duplicate code, test maintenance overhead, and improves test suite speed.

### Managing Setup Cost with Test Fixtures

- Share expensive initialization with `SetUpTestSuite()` if all tests need it.
- Use per-test `SetUp()` sparingly.
- Nullify expensive dependencies where possible using mocks or fakes.

### Controlling Test Execution Order

- Avoid dependencies between tests so they can safely run in parallel.
- Use sequences or explicit ordering only when absolutely necessary.

### Controlling Verbosity and Logging

- Use `--gtest_brief=1` or equivalent to reduce output noise.
- Increase verbosity only when debugging test failures.

### Using Sharding for Large Test Sets

- Define test shards for concurrent execution on multiple machines/cores.
- Combine results post-run to get full coverage.

### Writing Lightweight and Independent Tests

- Write tests that complete quickly to maximize throughput.
- Use mocks and stubs to avoid slow downstream dependencies.

### Leverage External Tools

- Employ `gtest-parallel` or test runners provided by your build system.
- Combine with CI/CD pipelines to validate code continually and in parallel.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Why are my tests running slowly?

- Excessive global/static initialization.
- Expensive setup/teardown operations run on every test.
- Tests depending on slow external resources.
- Non-parallel execution of a large number of tests.

### How to diagnose slow tests?

- Profile test execution timings.
- Isolate slow tests by timing individual test cases.
- Use tracing and code coverage tools to find bottlenecks.

### How to fix slow tests?

- Refactor tests to remove expensive dependencies.
- Use mocks/fakes to simulate external components.
- Reorganize tests into faster sub-suites.
- Run in parallel using appropriate external tools.
