# Performance Optimization Tips

Efficient unit testing is vital for maintaining productivity in large or complex C++ codebases. This page provides actionable tips and best practices for writing faster tests, speeding up execution times, and leveraging GoogleTest’s built-in features such as test discovery and parallelization. By incorporating these strategies, you can maximize the throughput of your test suites without sacrificing accuracy or maintainability.

---

## 1. Minimize Test Overhead

Each test in GoogleTest runs independently to ensure isolation, but some overhead is incurred during setup and tear-down. To keep tests fast:

- **Keep tests focused and small:** Write tests that verify individual behaviors or units rather than large integrated flows.
- **Use minimal fixture setup:** Avoid expensive initialization in per-test `SetUp()` unless absolutely necessary. Instead, reuse resources via `SetUpTestSuite()`.
- **Reuse common data and resources:** Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to allocate shared expensive resources once per test suite, rather than once per test. Be sure to maintain test isolation by not mutating shared state or restoring the state after mutations.

### Example: Sharing Resources Efficiently
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static DatabaseConnection* db_;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_ = new DatabaseConnection("my_test_db");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete db_;
    db_ = nullptr;
  }
};

DatabaseConnection* FooTest::db_ = nullptr;
```

This reduces the overhead of establishing connections for every test.

## 2. Use Test Filtering to Run Relevant Tests

During iterative development or debugging, running the entire test suite can be time-consuming. Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to select subsets of tests for quicker feedback:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.*
```
Runs all tests in the `FooTest` suite.

You can combine patterns and exclude tests as well:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.*-FooTest.FlakyTest
```
Exclude `FlakyTest` while running the rest in `FooTest`.

Filtering tests effectively narrows down test execution time, enabling faster diagnosis and iteration.

---

## 3. Enable Test Parallelization and Sharding

GoogleTest supports running tests in parallel shards to leverage multi-core CPUs or distributed environments.

### Running Tests in Parallel Shards

Set the following environment variables before running your test executable on multiple machines or processes:

- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: Total number of shards (processes/machines) running.
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: Index of the current shard (0-based).

GoogleTest automatically partitions tests across shards, ensuring each test runs exactly once.

Example for 4 shards:

| Machine | Variables Set                     |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| 0       | GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4              |
|         | GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0               |
| 1       | GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4              |
|         | GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1               |
| 2       | GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4              |
|         | GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2               |
| 3       | GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4              |
|         | GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=3               |

All instances run the same executable but execute different test subsets in parallel.

> **Tip:** If you use Bazel or a CI system like Jenkins, leverage built-in test sharding support combined with GoogleTest’s sharding flags.

### Caveats:
- Do not shard death tests as the child processes spawn their own runs.
- Ensure tests are thread-safe and independent.

---

## 4. Shuffle Tests to Uncover Order Dependencies

Unexpected dependencies between tests can introduce flakiness and hidden bugs. To detect these:

- Use the `--gtest_shuffle` flag to run tests in a random order.

```bash
./my_test --gtest_shuffle
```

- Optionally specify a seed with `--gtest_random_seed=SEED` to reproduce a particular ordering.

This practice improves test suite robustness by revealing inter-test dependencies.

---

## 5. Minimize Work in Fixtures and Use Efficient Mocking

- Avoid expensive computations in your mock expectations or fixtures.
- Use GoogleMock’s default actions and simple matchers unless complex behavior is necessary.
- Avoid repeated expensive object constructions by reusing mock objects where possible.

Efficient mocking helps reduce unnecessary CPU and memory usage during tests.

---

## 6. Profile and Identify Bottlenecks

Use standard profiling tools (e.g., `perf`, Visual Studio Profiler, or Instruments on Mac) to measure test runtime hotspots.

- Identify tests or fixtures consuming disproportionate time.
- Refactor or split slow tests.
- Consider breaking tests that cover multiple concerns into smaller focused tests.

This empirical approach ensures your optimization efforts are targeted.

---

## 7. Generate Test Output to Analyze Performance

Use XML or JSON output (`--gtest_output=xml:path/to/file.xml`) to get detailed reports that include test durations.

- Identify slow-running test cases and suites.
- Use this information to guide refactoring or parallelization strategies.


## 8. Avoid Running Disabled or Flaky Tests Unintentionally

- Tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` are excluded by default but still compiled.
- Use the `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag judiciously to include them if needed.

Avoid running large numbers of disabled or flaky tests to keep CI feedback fast and reliable.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Taking Unexpectedly Long

- Check if any test contains expensive setup or global resource initialization.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` to move expensive setup to the test suite level where possible.
- Profile individual tests to find slowest ones.

### Sharding Doesn’t Split Tests Evenly

- Verify that `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` are correctly set on each shard and in the range.
- Confirm all shards run the **exact same** test binary.
- Remember sharding only splits entire tests, not individual assertions.

### Tests Fail or Hang When Running in Parallel

- Ensure tests are thread-safe and do not share mutable global state without synchronization.
- Death tests are not compatible with parallel execution.

### Test Output Format Not Generating

- Ensure `--gtest_output` flag is correctly used.
- XML and JSON output requires file system access; confirm write permissions.
