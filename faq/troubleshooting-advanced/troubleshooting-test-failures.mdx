# Troubleshooting Test Failures

GoogleTest provides a robust testing framework, but sometimes tests fail, do not run, or yield unexpected results. This page guides you systematically through diagnosing such issues, focusing on common causes such as mock configuration errors and assertion misuse, with practical advice and tips to address them.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Failures

Failures can manifest as tests not running, incorrect pass/fail results, or unexpected errors during test execution. The following causes are commonly behind such issues:

- **Incorrect Mock Setup:** Missing or mismatched `EXPECT_CALL` declarations causing uninteresting or unexpected calls.
- **Assertion Misuse:** Using `ASSERT_*` macros incorrectly, leading to premature test abortion or undetected failures.
- **Fixture Set-Up Problems:** Errors in constructors or `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` methods aborting tests early.
- **Test Registration Issues:** Test cases not linked properly or inadvertently disabled.


## 2. Diagnosing Common Test Failure Symptoms

### Tests Not Running

- Confirm you have called `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Verify test names and test suite names do not contain underscores (`_`) which can cause naming conflicts. See [Why should test suite names and test names not contain underscore?](../faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore).
- Check if tests are disabled with the `DISABLED_` prefix or filtered out by `--gtest_filter`.
- Ensure test fixtures have accessible default constructors if using `TEST_F`.

### Unexpected Passes or Failures

- Always **return the result** of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` function - ignoring this can cause tests to erroneously appear to pass.
- Use `ASSERT_*` macros only within `void` returning functions; misuse can lead to unexpected continuation after fatal failures.
- For better failure message diagnostics, use predicate assertions (`EXPECT_PRED*` or `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`) or gMock matchers.

### Mock-Related Failures

- If you see "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings, it means mock methods were called without an `EXPECT_CALL` expectation.
  - Fix: Add appropriate `EXPECT_CALL` statements or switch to a `NiceMock` wrapper to suppress warnings.
- Unexpected or unmatched mock calls generally indicate your expectations don't match actual calls.
  - Match arguments precisely or use flexible matchers such as `_`.
- Verify that all mock methods with expectations have been called the expected number of times. Missing calls can fail tests silently otherwise.

### Fixture and Setup Issues

- Do not put fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`) in constructors or destructors. Instead, use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for setup and cleanup.
- If test suite set-up (`SetUpTestSuite()`) or tear-down (`TearDownTestSuite()`) fail, subsequent tests are skipped.
- Consider using `GTEST_SKIP()` inside setup to conditionally skip tests.


## 3. Practical Tips & Best Practices

### Using SCOPED_TRACE for Traceable Failures

Failure inside helper functions or shared subroutines can be hard to locate. Enclose invocations in `SCOPED_TRACE("context info")` to annotate failures, helping identify which particular invocation failed:

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("processing index " << i);
CheckValue(x[i]);
```

### Propagating Fatal Failures from Subroutines

Fatal failures abort only the current function. To propagate them up and stop further test execution:  
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement);` or 
- Test `HasFatalFailure()` after the statement and return early.

### Handling Death Tests

Death tests run the tested statement in a subprocess and check for termination. 
- Keep mocking and expectations **inside** the `EXPECT_DEATH()` macro to ensure correctness.
- Avoid threads running before `EXPECT_DEATH` as it can cause hangs or crashes.
- Name your death test *test suites* ending with `*DeathTest` to control execution order.

### Logging Additional Properties

You can attach custom properties to tests via `RecordProperty("key", value)` to include additional metadata in XML or JSON reports.


## 4. Systematic Troubleshooting Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Setup
- Verify test framework initialization and linkage.
- Confirm compiler compatibility and flags (see Supported Platforms).

### Step 2: Check Test Discovery
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to list all discovered tests.
- Verify that your test functions appear and are named correctly.

### Step 3: Check Test Execution
- Run with default settings to see any output or failure messages.
- Use `--gtest_filter` to isolate specific tests.

### Step 4: Investigate Mock Expectations
- Review `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` usage.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` and/or increase `--gtest_stack_trace_depth` for detailed call traces.

### Step 5: Investigate Assertion Failures
- Review assertion messages; prefer expressive assertions using matchers or predicate-formatter macros.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to improve diagnostic clarity.

### Step 6: Verify Fixtures and Setup/TearDown
- Review constructors and `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for invalid operations or assertion misuse.
- Check for skipped tests due to setup failures or `GTEST_SKIP()`.

### Step 7: Use Additional Diagnostic Facilities
- Employ event listeners to capture test lifecycle events.
- Enable code coverage and sanitizer integrations for runtime error detection.


## 5. Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`**: This causes misleading success signals.
- **Fatal assertions in non-void functions**: Leads to compiler errors or test misbehavior.
- **Mixing fixture classes in the same test suite**: GoogleTest requires all tests in a suite to share the same fixture class.
- **Overriding or shadowing tests with the same suite and test names in different namespaces but different fixtures** causing runtime errors.
- **Death tests with multi-threaded setups** lead to deadlocks or unstable test runs.


## 6. Troubleshooting Failures in Complex Scenarios

### Catching Failures in Test Utilities

You can test whether code *generates* expected failures using macros such as:

```cpp
EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(statement, "expected message substring");
EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(statement, "expected message substring");
```

To intercept failures from all threads, use their `_ON_ALL_THREADS` variants.

### Debugging Setup/TearDown Failures

- If your `SetUpTestSuite()` fails, **all** tests in the suite will be skipped. Review setup logic carefully.
- Use XML or JSON output to inspect failed setup or teardown stages.

### Handling Unexpected Calls and Call Ordering

- Verify that you do not have calls to mocks outside of expectations.
- If call sequencing is important, use `InSequence` or `.After()` clauses to specify order.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations if needed.

### Using Verbose Flags for Deep Diagnostics

Run your tests with:

```
--gmock_verbose=info --gtest_stack_trace_depth=10
```

This will print detailed call and expectation match traces.


## 7. Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide extensive diagnostics to understand test failures. Always start by verifying basic setup and test discovery. Gradually deepen diagnostics via verbose flags, mock trace outputs, and using helper macros like `SCOPED_TRACE`. Remember the distinction between uninteresting vs unexpected mock calls and use `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` appropriately. Keep fixture usage consistent, and place assertions in the appropriate lifecycle methods.

Successful debugging requires combining these strategies systematically.

## Additional Resources

- Run tests with `--gtest_list_tests` to verify test discovery.
- Use `--gtest_filter` to run subsets of tests.
- Use event listeners to hook into test lifecycle events for custom logging.

## Proactive Tips

- Always implement default mock behaviors with `ON_CALL` before setting `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Avoid placing fatal failures in constructors; prefer `SetUp()`/`TearDown()`.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` liberally in helper functions to clarify failure contexts.
- Run flaky tests repeatedly using `--gtest_repeat` and shuffle order using `--gtest_shuffle` to unearth concurrency or order dependencies.
