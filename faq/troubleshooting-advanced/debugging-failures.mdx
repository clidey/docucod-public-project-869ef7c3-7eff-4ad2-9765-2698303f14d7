# Debugging Test & Mock Failures

When unit tests or mocks fail unexpectedly, understanding the underlying cause quickly is crucial for resolving issues and restoring test reliability. This guide equips you to interpret gMock and GoogleTest error messages, access detailed debug information, and use built-in diagnostics to trace and fix failures efficiently.

## 1. Understanding Failure Output

When a test fails involving mocks, the output provides a wealth of information about what went wrong. Familiarize yourself first with these common categories of messages:

- **Unexpected Calls**: Occur when the code calls a mock method with arguments that do not match any active `EXPECT_CALL`.
- **Uninteresting Calls**: Calls to mock methods with no expectations set. These generate warnings by default.
- **Excessive Calls**: Occur when a mock method is called more times than the number expected.
- **Unsatisfied Expectations**: When an expected call (via `EXPECT_CALL`) was not triggered the required number of times.
- **Ordering Violations**: When calls happen out of the specified order using `InSequence` or `After`.
- **Retired Expectations**: Calls that match an expectation that is no longer active due to saturation or sequence.
- **Mismatch Arguments**: When the actual arguments in a call do not satisfy the matchers used in the expectation.

Each failure message includes details such as:

- The **function call** with its arguments as received.
- Which **expectations were tried** and why they failed to match.
- The **location in source code** where expectations were set.
- Whether the call was **uninteresting**, **unexpected**, or excessive.
- The **action taken** (default action or failure).


<AccordionGroup title="Common Failure Messages and What They Mean">
<Accordion title="Unexpected Mock Function Call">
If a method call to the mock does not match any declared `EXPECT_CALL`, Google Mock reports an "Unexpected mock function call".

The output shows the function call and arguments, then lists all expectations tried and details why they did not match (e.g., argument mismatch, retired, unsatisfied prerequisites).

Example excerpt:

```
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: DoB(2)
Google Mock tried the following 1 expectation, but it didn't match:
EXPECT_CALL(b, DoB(1))...
  Expected arg #0: is equal to 1
  Actual: 2
```

This means the function was called with `2`, but an expectation only allowed `1`.

**Action**: Check your expectation's matchers and make sure they cover all intended call cases or add a fallback expectation (e.g., `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_)).Times(AnyNumber())`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Uninteresting Call Warning">
When no expectation is set for a mock method but it is called anyway, Google Mock emits a warning:

```
GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Bar2(0, 1)
NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen.
```

This indicates that you didnâ€™t declare any expectations on that method.

**Tip:** Use `NiceMock` to silence these warnings if the calls are expected and unimportant.

**Action:** If this call should not happen, add an `EXPECT_CALL` restricting or verifying the call. Otherwise, accept the warning or use `NiceMock`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Excessive Calls (Too Many Invocations)">
Google Mock reports when a function is called more often than expected:

```
Mock function called more times than expected - returning default value.
    Function call: DoB(2)
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: called twice - over-saturated and active
```

**Action:** Check your `Times()` clause and ensure the tested code is not invoking the method more than intended. If multiple calls are valid, adjust expectations accordingly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unsatisfied Expectations">
If an expected call has not been made the specified number of times by test end, the failure shows:

```
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(foo_, Bar(0, _))...
         Expected: to be called twice
           Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active
```

This indicates expectations have not been fulfilled.

**Action:** Confirm that the test code executes paths invoking the mock method the expected number of times.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ordering Violations">
If calls occur out of order when ordered expectations are set, Google Mock reports unexpected call failures, e.g., when `InSequence` or `After` are used to enforce call order.

Example:

```
Unexpected mock function call
Expected calls to be in sequence...
```

**Action:** Make sure the calls in test or production code follow the specified order, or reconsider ordering constraints for more flexibility.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Accessing Detailed Debug Information

### Using the `--gmock_verbose` Flag

The `--gmock_verbose` command-line flag controls the verbosity of Google Mock's diagnostic output:

- `info` - Prints detailed diagnostic information for **all** mock calls, including matches, argument values, return values, and stack traces.
- `warning` - Default. Prints warnings for uninteresting calls and errors.
- `error` - Prints **only** errors, reducing noise.

Use this flag to gain insight when debugging expectation failures. For example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This produces trace messages for each expectation set and matching calls, helping you verify which `EXPECT_CALL` matched or why to which calls do not match.

### Suppressing or Showing Stack Traces

Combine `--gmock_verbose=info` with `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=0` to see detailed call matching without stack traces, or increase stack trace depth to get file/line context of mock calls.

### Interpreting Diagnostic Messages

When running with `--gmock_verbose=info`, you'll see messages like:

```
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)) invoked
Mock function call matches EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_))...
    Function call: Method(42)
          Returns: 0
Stack trace:
 ...
```

This helps confirm which expectations matched which calls.

### Naggy, Nice, and Strict Mocks

Remember the impact of mock type on diagnostic messages:

- **NaggyMock** (default) warns on uninteresting calls.
- **NiceMock** suppresses those warnings.
- **StrictMock** treats uninteresting calls as errors.

Choose appropriately based on your test strictness and verbosity requirements.

---

## 3. Using Built-in Diagnostic Functions

Google Mock automatically provides detailed diagnosis for your mock failures. If you want to explicitly verify and clear expectations during test execution (e.g. before mock destruction), you can use:

```cpp
bool success = ::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);
```

This returns `true` if expectations have been met, or prints failure details and returns `false` otherwise.

If you need to reset all expectations and default actions:

```cpp
bool success = ::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock_obj);
```

These calls help isolate issues or enforce correctness at desired testing points.

You can also suppress mock leaks warnings if an owning system takes responsibility for mock lifecycle:

```cpp
::testing::Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj);
```

## 4. Troubleshooting Workflow

When facing test or mock failures, follow this systematic approach:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Failure Output Carefully">
Examine the failure message and look for key terms like "unexpected call", "unsatisfied expectation", or "uninteresting call". Note mismatched arguments and locations referenced in the output.
</Step>
<Step title="Run with `--gmock_verbose=info`">
Enable verbose diagnostic output to get traces of calls, matched expectations, and stack traces pointing to origins of calls and expectations.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Matchers and Expectations">
Verify that your `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` matchers correctly cover the expected calls including fallback matchers with wildcard `_` and durations (`Times()`).
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Mock Behavior or Test Logic">
Use `ON_CALL` to define default mock behaviors for uninteresting calls if appropriate, or tighten expectations. Fix test logic to meet expected call counts and ordering.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Sequences and Ordering Clauses Carefully">
If ordering is enforced, verify the code interaction follows the intended call order or loosen constraints if too restrictive.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Mock Lifetimes and Leaking Mocks">
Ensure mocks are destroyed to trigger automatic expectation verification, or explicitly verify with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`. Allow leaks only when intentional.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Useful Tips and Best Practices

- **Suppress Noisy Warnings**: Use `NiceMock` when you want to suppress warnings about calls to methods you do not expect to verify.
- **Enable Verbose Mode for Debugging**: Use `--gmock_verbose=info` only during active debugging to avoid excess output.
- **Order Expectations Explicitly**: Use sequences (`InSequence`) or `.After()` only when necessary to avoid brittle tests.
- **Use Fallback Expectation**: Add a catch-all expectation `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to handle unexpected arguments gracefully.
- **Check for Retired Expectations**: Understand that expectations marked `RetiresOnSaturation()` will no longer match calls once saturated.
- **Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` in Complex Lifecycles**: If a mock is not destructed naturally at test end, force verification to catch failures.
- **Always Verify Virtual Destructor in Mocked Classes**: Failing to have virtual destructors causes undefined behavior and leaks that complicate debugging.

## 6. Common Pitfalls in Debugging Failures

- Adding too many expectations causes excessive call errors.
- Omitting fallback expectations causes unexpected call failures.
- Ordering constraints too strict cause unexpected call failures when call order diverges.
- Using mocks with non-virtual destructors causes leaks and missed verifications.
- Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` instead of `ON_CALL` makes tests fragile and verbose.

## Appendix: Example Failure Message Walkthrough

```
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: DoB(1, 2)
          Returns: false
Google Mock tried the following 2 expectations, but none matched:

EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoB(0, _))...
  Expected arg #0: is equal to 0
  Actual: 1
  Expected: to be called once
  Actual: never called - unsatisfied and active
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoB(1, 3))...
  Expected arg #1: is equal to 3
  Actual: 2
  Expected: to be called once
  Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active
```

This output indicates two expectations exist; the call with arguments (1, 2) matches neither because arg0 and arg1 mismatches. Also, the stato of actual call counts is reported, helping locate partial matches and the root of failure.
