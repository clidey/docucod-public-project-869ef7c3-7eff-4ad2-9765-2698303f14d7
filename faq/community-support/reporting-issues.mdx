# Reporting Bugs and Contributing

This page guides you on how to effectively report issues, request new features, and contribute to the GoogleTest project. Proper engagement ensures productive conversations and accelerates issue resolution, benefiting both you and the maintainers.

---

## 1. How to Report Bugs

When you encounter unexpected behavior or find a bug, following these steps helps maintainers understand and resolve your issue quickly.

### 1.1 Prepare Your Bug Report

- **Reproduce the Problem**: Try to isolate the bug with the smallest possible test case. A minimal reproducible example using GoogleTest APIs (e.g., assertions, test macros) is invaluable.
- **Check for Known Issues**: Review the existing [issues on the official repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) and the documentation FAQ to see if your problem has already been addressed.
- **Gather Environment Details**: Include your OS, compiler version, build system, GoogleTest version, and any relevant configurations or flags.

### 1.2 Write a Clear Bug Description

Your report should include:

- **What you expected to happen**
- **What actually happened**
- **Steps to reproduce the issue** (prefer using GoogleTest test cases where possible)
- **Actual and expected output**, including any assertion failure messages or error logs
- **Minimal code snippets**, preferably self-contained tests or examples

### 1.3 Submit the Bug Report

- Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/new)
- Follow any issue templates provided
- Respond promptly to maintainersâ€™ requests for additional information

<Tip>
A well-structured bug report expedites fixes and helps maintainers allocate resources efficiently.

## 2. Requesting Features

If you have ideas for new functionality or improvements that will benefit others using GoogleTest, please:

- Search existing feature requests in the issues page to avoid duplicates.
- Describe the use case and problem the feature solves.
- Suggest an API or workflow if possible.
- Explain how it complements or improves existing APIs (e.g., assertions, mocking features).

<Note>
Feature requests should focus on user needs and workflows rather than internal implementation details.
</Note>

## 3. Contributing Code

GoogleTest welcomes contributions that improve quality, fix bugs, or add new features.

### 3.1 Before You Start

- Familiarize yourself with the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and [Advanced Topics](advanced.md).
- Review existing code patterns, especially test cases and mock usage, to write consistent code.
- Ensure your development environment meets the [System Requirements](system-requirements) and you can build the project successfully.

### 3.2 Making Your Contribution

1. **Fork the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   cd googletest
   git remote add fork https://github.com/<your_username>/googletest.git
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make Your Change:**

   - Follow the existing coding style.
   - Add or update tests to cover your changes using GoogleTest patterns.
   - Document your addition or modification clearly.

3. **Run All Tests:**

   Use the standard build and test commands (see [Installation with CMake](installation-cmake)) to verify your changes do not break existing functionality.

4. **Commit Changes with Clear Messages:**

   Follow conventional commit message practices.

5. **Submit a Pull Request:**

   - Push your branch to your fork.
   - Open a PR against `main` branch of the official repository.
   - Provide a summary of your change, motivation, and any relevant issue numbers.

<Tip>
Adding tests is essential. GoogleTest is itself a testing framework; your tests ensure stability and maintain project quality.
</Tip>

## 4. Guidelines For Effective Contributions

- **Keep User Impact in Mind:** Focus on solutions that improve user experience, ease of use, or performance.
- **Provide Examples:** Where applicable, add examples demonstrating new APIs or usage patterns.
- **Write Clear Documentation:** Update the relevant documentation pages or reference files to reflect your changes.
- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Avoid breaking existing APIs unless absolutely necessary and justified.
- **Engage in Discussions:** Monitor your issues and PRs, reply to reviewer comments, and adjust accordingly.

## 5. Code of Conduct and Community Etiquette

- Be respectful and patient with maintainers and other contributors.
- Stay focused on technical issues.
- Consider opening issues for concerns about project management.
