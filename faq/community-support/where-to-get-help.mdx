# Where Can I Get Help or Report an Issue?

Navigating troubleshooting or contributing to GoogleTest and GoogleMock is straightforward when you know where to go. This guide details the official channels where you can seek help, participate in discussions, report issues, or contribute code and documentation.

---

## Supported Bug Trackers

If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior while using GoogleTest or GoogleMock, the primary place to report it is the **GitHub Issue Tracker**:

- **GoogleTest GitHub Issue Tracker:** [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

Before filing a new issue:

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear summary of the problem.
- Include details like your platform, compiler version, GoogleTest version, and a minimal reproducer if possible.

Issues can be about:

- Setup and integration problems
- Failures or unexpected test behavior
- Feature requests
- Documentation errors or omissions

<Note>
Reporting issues on GitHub issues helps the maintainers track and prioritize fixes and improvements efficiently.
</Note>

## Mailing Lists and Forums

While GoogleTest primarily supports discussion and issue tracking through GitHub, there are community-driven forums and mailing lists around C++ testing and GoogleTest:

- **Google Groups:** Some older GoogleTest discussions and questions may be found archived on general C++ testing or testing framework groups.
- **Stack Overflow:** Tag your questions with `googletest` or `gmock` for community support.

<Info>
These venues are good for community help, but official issue tracking and patches go through GitHub.
</Info>

## Real-Time Assistance Channels

For more immediate or informal assistance:

- **Chat Platforms:** There may be unofficial GoogleTest or C++ testing communities on platforms such as Slack, Discord, or IRC where users and contributors mingle.

While not officially maintained by the GoogleTest team, these can be great resources for quick tips and peer support.

## How to Use GitHub Issues Effectively

When opening an issue:

```markdown
**Title:** Clear, concise summary of the problem

**Description:**
- What you expect to happen
- What actually happens
- Steps to reproduce including code snippets
- Environment details (OS, compiler, GoogleTest version)
- Any relevant logs or error messages
```

Avoid filing:

- Feature requests without justification or use cases
- Questions better suited for forums or mailing lists

<Warning>
Before submitting an issue, verify against the latest release and master branch in case it has been fixed.
</Warning>
