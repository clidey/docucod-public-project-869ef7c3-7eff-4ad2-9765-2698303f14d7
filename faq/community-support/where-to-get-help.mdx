# Getting Help and Support

This page provides a comprehensive list of official channels and resources available for reporting bugs, requesting new features, or seeking troubleshooting assistance with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It also includes direct links to essential documentation, mailing lists, forums, and community discussion hubs to connect users with expert support and peer guidance.

---

## Official Support Channels

### 1. GitHub Issue Tracker

Reporting bugs and requesting features is best done via the GitHub issue tracker for GoogleTest:

- GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

Users are encouraged to provide detailed information including:

- Environment details (OS, compiler, version)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected and actual behavior
- Minimal reproducible example

This helps maintainers triage and address issues efficiently.

---

### 2. Mailing Lists

While GoogleTest does not officially maintain a dedicated mailing list, users often seek help and share knowledge on various developer mailing lists related to C++ testing. You may find it useful to join:

- C++ community forums
- Testing-related discussion groups

Check for any community-based lists or local team lists related to GoogleTest.

---

### 3. Online Forums and Q&A Sites

Broader programming communities can be valuable for troubleshooting:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest)
  - Use tags such as `googletest`, `gmock`, and `google-test` to filter relevant questions.

- GoogleTest Discussions or relevant subreddits (e.g., r/cpp)

Keep questions precise, include error messages, and your test code snippet for quicker responses.
