## Where to Ask Questions and Find Answers

### 1. Official Issue Tracker

- **GitHub Issues:** 
  - Use GitHub’s [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to report bugs, submit feature requests, or ask technical questions.
  - Before opening a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
  - Provide detailed descriptions, minimal reproducible examples, and the environment details.

### 2. Stack Overflow

- **Tagged Questions:** 
  - Visit [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) and use tags like `googletest` or `googlemock`.
  - Browse questions answered by the community.
  - When asking, provide clear, minimal code samples demonstrating your question.

### 3. Google Groups and Mailing Lists

- Some legacy discussions and announcements are posted on Google Groups. While these are less active, they are still a valuable archive.

### 4. Community Forums

- Various community-driven forums and chat channels exist, often linked from popular repositories or blogs. For example, some C++ or testing communities frequently address GoogleTest questions.

### 5. Internal Support Channels (for corporate users)

- If you use GoogleTest within a corporate environment, check if your organization maintains internal chat rooms, mailing lists, or support tickets.
