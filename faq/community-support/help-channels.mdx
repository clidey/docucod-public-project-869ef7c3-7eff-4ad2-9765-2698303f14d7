# Where to Get Help and Support

This page serves as your guide to official support channels, community resources, and best practices for getting timely and effective help with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you're facing technical challenges, exploring advanced features, or seeking advice, these resources will connect you to the right assistance.

## Official Support Channels

### 1. GitHub Issue Tracker

The primary venue for reporting bugs, requesting features, or raising concerns about GoogleTest and GoogleMock is the GitHub repository's issue tracker:

- **Repository:** [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Use clear, descriptive titles and include detailed information such as:
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Environment details (OS, compiler versions, GoogleTest version)
  - Minimal reproducible example, if possible

**Important:** Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates and check if your question has already been addressed.

### 2. Mailing List and Official Forums

While GoogleTest and GoogleMock do not have a dedicated official mailing list or forum maintained by the core team, some discussions take place within broader C++ testing communities or Google Groups related to testing frameworks.

For official announcements or discussions, monitor:

- The GitHub repository's Discussions tab (if enabled)
- External forums where GoogleTest is actively discussed (see Community Resources section below)

### 3. Professional Support

For commercial support needs or enterprise-level assistance, consider third-party consulting services specializing in C++ testing frameworks. Google itself does not provide paid support for GoogleTest.
