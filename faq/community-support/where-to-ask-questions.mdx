# Where can I ask questions or report bugs?

This page guides you on finding the right official support channels, community forums, and issue trackers for asking questions, requesting help, or reporting bugs for GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

---

## Official Support Channels

### GitHub Issues Tracker

- The primary official place to report bugs, request features, or ask for help is the
  [GoogleTest GitHub repository issues tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- When filing an issue:
  - Provide a **clear, detailed description** of the problem.
  - Include **code snippets or minimal reproducible examples** illustrating the issue.
  - Specify your **environment details** such as operating system, compiler, and GoogleTest version.
  - Attach relevant **build commands, error messages, and logs** if applicable.

<Tip>
Effective bug reports accelerate fixing. Always check if your issue is already reported to avoid duplicates.
</Tip>

### Official Mailing Lists and Contact

- Google does not provide formal dedicated mailing lists or direct email support for GoogleTest.
- Instead, the project community and maintainers focus on GitHub issues and public discussion.

### Stack Overflow

- For general usage questions, programming advice, or troubleshooting, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) with the tags:
  - `googletest`
  - `gmock`
- This community offers practical help from fellow users and contributors.

## Community Forums and Resources

### Google Groups and Mailing Lists

- While not official, some GoogleTest and GoogleMock user groups exist for discussions. Look for:
  - GoogleTest user groups
  - GoogleMock help forums

### Community-Created Documentation

- Several community resources help clarify concepts and provide examples. Check out:
  - [Googlemock Insights](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md)

### Official Documentation and FAQs

Before opening issues or posting questions, review these key official resources:

- [Installation Instructions](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-instructions) 
- [Project Configuration](/getting-started/configuration-initial-run/project-setup)
- [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)
- [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html)
- [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md)

## Guidelines for Effective Bug Reporting

To help the maintainers address your issue quickly and efficiently, consider the following best practices:

1. **Verify your environment** — Reproduce your problem with the latest stable GoogleTest release.
2. **Search existing issues** — Many questions and bugs are already reported and addressed.
3. **Minimal Reproducible Example** — Isolate your problem with as little code as possible.
4. **Use descriptive titles** and provide meaningful details in the issue body.
5. **Specify versions** — Clearly mention your OS, compiler, and GoogleTest versions.
6. **Steps to reproduce** the issue precisely.
7. **Expected vs actual behavior** — Describe what you expect and what actually happens.

<Tip>
Following this structure will significantly increase the chance of timely assistance.
</Tip>

## Summary

With no dedicated official support team, GoogleTest and GoogleMock rely on user-driven community assistance. Use the GitHub issues tracker for bug reports and feature requests, Stack Overflow for questions, and community forums for discussion. Always prioritize reviewing existing documentation and issues.
