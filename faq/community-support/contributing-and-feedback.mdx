## How to Contribute Code to GoogleTest and GoogleMock

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open-source projects actively maintained by the community and Google. Contributions help improve the quality, features, and stability of the framework.

### Steps for Code Contribution

1. **Read the Contribution Guide:** Before submitting any code changes, review the official contribution guidelines in the repository. This ensures your contributions follow project standards, style, and processes.

2. **Fork and Clone the Repository:** Create your own fork of the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) and clone it locally.

3. **Create a Branch:** Create a separate branch for your development work. Use descriptive names such as `fix-linker-issue` or `add-new-matcher`.

4. **Make Changes:** Implement your bug fixes, features, tests, and documentation updates. Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and thoroughly tested.

5. **Run Tests:** Verify that all existing and new tests pass locally. GoogleTest includes comprehensive tests for both GoogleTest and GoogleMock components.

6. **Submit a Pull Request:** Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) on the main repository. Provide a clear description of the change, motivation, and any relevant references.

7. **Respond to Review:** Engage with maintainers during the review process. Address feedback and update your PR as needed until it meets acceptance criteria.

<Tip>
For detailed contribution instructions, check the README and CONTRIBUTING files in the repository and adhere to the coding style and testing policies.

## Practical Tips

- Always run the full test suite locally before submitting code changes.
- Keep pull requests focused and atomic to simplify review.
- Use clear commit messages.
- For documentation changes, link them to specific issues when possible.
- Discuss large or breaking changes beforehand in issues or discussions.

<Warning>
Avoid assuming undocumented functionality; contributions should align with existing project capabilities.
</Warning>

### Example

Hereâ€™s a hypothetical example of contributing an improvement to a matcher example in the documentation:

```cpp
// Original example in docs has a typo or missing explanation
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoSomething(Lt(5)))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return('a'));

// You fix the matcher explanation or argument comment and add a test
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoSomething(Le(5)))  // Fixed to less or equal
    .WillRepeatedly(Return('a'));
```

Submit this as a pull request with a description "Fix matcher example for clarity in gMock documentation." Maintainers will review and merge if appropriate.
