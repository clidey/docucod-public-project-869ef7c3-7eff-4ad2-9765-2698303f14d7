## How to Report Bugs

Reporting bugs helps improve the framework for everyone. Please follow these steps to provide effective, actionable bug reports:

1. **Verify the Issue**
   - Confirm the problem occurs on the latest release or main branch.
   - Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

2. **Prepare a Minimal Reproducible Example**
   - Create a small test case or code snippet demonstrating the issue clearly.
   - The example should stand alone, illustrating the problem without unnecessary complexity.

3. **Gather Environment Details**
   - Include compiler version, platform OS, build system (e.g., CMake/Bazel), and GoogleTest version.
   - Note any relevant command-line flags or environment setups.

4. **File the Issue on GitHub**
   - Open a new issue in the [googletest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
   - Use a clear and descriptive title.
   - Fill the issue template completely, providing all gathered information.

5. **Be Responsive**
   - Follow up promptly to questions or requests for additional info from maintainers.

<Tip>
Thorough and clear bug reports accelerate resolution and help maintain project quality.

## How to Request Features

Feature requests fuel the evolution of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. To submit a request:

1. **Check Existing Requests**
   - Search the issues to ensure your idea is not already planned or discussed.

2. **Explain the Use Case**
   - Provide a real-world scenario or problem where the feature would add value.

3. **Suggest Design Ideas (Optional)**
   - If possible, outline how the feature might be implemented or integrated.

4. **Create a Feature Request Issue**
   - Submit it via GitHub with a meaningful title and detailed description.

5. **Engage with the Community**
   - Participate in discussions to refine the feature and understand trade-offs.
