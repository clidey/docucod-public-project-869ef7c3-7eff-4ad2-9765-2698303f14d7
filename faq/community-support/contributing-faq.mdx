# Contributing & Reporting Issues

This page explains how you can effectively report problems, contribute improvements to the documentation, or participate in the development of the GoogleMock project. Whether you found a bug, want to request a feature, or help improve the docs or code, this guide outlines the steps to get involved and provides links to resources to make your contribution process smooth and productive.

## Reporting Issues

We value your feedback and aim to provide a high-quality, robust mocking framework. When you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior, reporting them clearly and with relevant details helps us address them quickly.

### How to Submit an Issue

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before submitting, check the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to see if your problem or idea has already been reported or discussed.
2. **Gather Details:** Include these key pieces of information:
   - **Clear description** of the problem or enhancement.
   - Steps to **reproduce** the bug, if applicable.
   - Your **environment details**: OS, compiler, GoogleMock version.
   - Minimal **code snippets** or test cases demonstrating the issue.
   - Any **error messages** or output logs.
3. **Create a New Issue:** Use the templates provided on GitHub, filling out the required sections to give us enough context.

### Best Practices When Reporting

- Be concise but thorough.
- Provide exact error messages and reproduce steps.
- Avoid attaching large files; use links if needed.
- Check whether the issue relates to GoogleTest or GoogleMock.

<Tip>
A well-crafted issue greatly speeds up troubleshooting and resolution.
</Tip>

## Contributing to Documentation

Improving the documentation helps all users understand and use GoogleMock better. Contributions can range from fixing typos to adding new examples or clarifying concepts.

### How to Contribute Docs

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the [googletest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
2. **Create a Branch:** Make a descriptive branch for your changes (e.g., `docs/fix-mocking-examples`).
3. **Edit the Markdown Files:** Docs reside primarily in `docs/`.
   - Follow existing style and tone.
   - Use clear, actionable language.
   - Keep technical explanations user-focused.
4. **Preview Your Changes:** Use Markdown preview tools or build docs locally as applicable.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** From your fork, create a pull request detailing your changes and their motivations.

### Tips for Effective Documentation Contributions

- Use user-centric language focusing on outcomes.
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions where relevant.
- Add examples and tips that relate to real-world usage.
- Avoid internal implementation details unless necessary for user understanding.

<Note>
Review existing pages like [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for style guidance.
</Note>

## Participating in Development

GoogleMock is an open-source project welcoming code contributions that improve features, fix bugs, or enhance test coverage.

### Steps to Contribute Code

1. **Understand the Codebase:** Familiarize yourself with the core concepts by reading:
   - The `docs/gmock_cook_book.md` and `docs/gmock_for_dummies.md` for foundational usage.
   - The `docs/reference/mocking.md` for API details.
2. **Fork and Branch:** Fork the repo and create a branch dedicated to your work.
3. **Implement and Test:**
   - Write clean, well-documented code.
   - Add tests for your changes or fixes.
   - Follow project's coding standards.
4. **Run the Test Suite:** Validate your changes do not break existing tests.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Provide a clear description of your change, referencing any related issues.

### Code Contribution Guidelines

- Mock methods use `MOCK_METHOD` macros in `public:` sections.
- Follow the project's style for qualifiers, e.g., `override`, `const`.
- Avoid mocking non-virtual methods unless employing documented techniques like high-perf dependency injection.
- Use existing examples from `docs/gmock_cook_book.md` as patterns.

<Tip>
Running and passing the existing automated test suite ensures your contribution maintains project quality.
