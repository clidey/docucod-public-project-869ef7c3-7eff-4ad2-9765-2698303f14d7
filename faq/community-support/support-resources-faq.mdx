## Where to Get Help

Whether you’re new to GoogleTest or a seasoned user encountering tricky situations, there are several reliable channels to get support:

### 1. Official Documentation
- **GoogleTest User's Guide:** Start here for in-depth usage and best practices, including the [Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) to get started quickly.
- **Mocking API Reference:** Detailed descriptions of mocking APIs provide clarity on behavior customization.
- **gMock Cookbook:** Offers practical recipes for common mocking scenarios, helping you master mock definitions and expectations.
- **Legacy gMock FAQ:** Answers common, long-standing questions about the framework.

### 2. GitHub Issues
- Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to report bugs or suggest new features.
- Before filing an issue, verify it isn’t already reported by searching existing issues.
- Provide clear reproduction steps and environment details to help maintainers diagnose the problem.

### 3. Discussion Forums and Mailing Lists
- GoogleTest previously hosted mailing lists and discussions; although limited, you might still find useful threads archiving past questions.
- For real-time help, consider querying Stack Overflow with tags like [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`googlemock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googlemock).

### 4. Community-Created Documentation
- Some users and contributors have produced supplementary documentation and tutorials such as the [Googlemock Insights by ElectricRCAircraftGuy](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md).
- These can provide alternative perspectives, best practices, and practical tips.
