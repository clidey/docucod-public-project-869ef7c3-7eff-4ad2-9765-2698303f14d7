## Example Workflow for Reporting a Bug

```markdown
Title: Crash When Using NiceMock<> with Mock class lacking virtual destructor

Description:
When I use `NiceMock<MyMock>` in my test, the program crashes on mock destruction.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define a mock class `MyMock` without a virtual destructor.
2. Create a `NiceMock<MyMock>` object in a test.
3. Run the test and observe the crash during cleanup.

Expected Behavior:
The mock object should clean up without crashing.

Actual Behavior:
The test crashes likely due to improper destruction.

Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Compiler: GCC 9.3
- gMock version: Latest main branch

Additional Info:
This is consistent with the warning about non-virtual destructors in the docs.
```
