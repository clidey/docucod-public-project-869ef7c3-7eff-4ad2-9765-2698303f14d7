## How to Contribute

Contributing to GoogleTest is a rewarding way to help improve a widely used C++ testing framework. Whether you're fixing bugs, proposing features, or improving documentation, your input is valued.

### Getting Started

1. **Familiarize Yourself**
   - Read the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and the [Advanced Topics](advanced.html) guides to understand the testing framework’s design and usage.
   - Review the [Coding Style Guidelines](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style) on the GitHub repository.

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git`
   - Use the `main` branch for the latest development work.
   - Follow build instructions in [Install with CMake](getting-started/prerequisites-installation/install-cmake.html) or [Install with Bazel](getting-started/prerequisites-installation/install-bazel.html).

3. **Understand the Contribution Workflow**
   - Develop your changes in a dedicated feature branch.
   - Ensure all tests pass locally using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
   - Write new tests for your changes if applicable, using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

4. **Follow Submission Guidelines**
   - Create pull requests (PRs) against the `main` branch.
   - Provide clear and descriptive titles and explanations of your PR.
   - Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) if prompted.

<Tip>
Early engagement through issue discussion before making major changes is encouraged to align with project goals and streamline reviews.

## Reporting Bugs

GoogleTest is actively maintained, and your feedback helps improve its quality. Here's how to report issues effectively:

### Identify The Problem

- Make sure the issue is reproducible and isolate the smallest test case that exposes it.
- Verify you are using a supported platform and compiler version as per the [Supported Platforms](platforms.html) page.

### Use the Issue Tracker

- Report issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- When creating an issue, include:
  - A concise yet descriptive title.
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - Expected and actual behaviors.
  - Environment details: OS, compiler version, GoogleTest version.
  - Minimal code snippets or test cases if possible.

<Note>
Please avoid duplicate reports. Search open and closed issues before submitting.
</Note>

## Submitting Feature Requests

Looking to add new functionality? Here's what to do:

- Check if a similar request already exists to avoid duplication.
- Open a new issue with the tag “feature request”.
- Describe your use case, motivation, and proposed approach clearly.
- Discuss trade-offs or limitations if known.

<Tip>
Contributing your own implementation with tests and passing builds accelerates adoption.
</Tip>
