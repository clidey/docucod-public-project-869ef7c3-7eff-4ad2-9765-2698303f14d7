# Performance Optimization Tips

This page guides users through common questions and best practices for improving the performance of GoogleTest test suites. It focuses on strategies to run tests efficiently, manage the overhead of large test collections, and leverage parallelism.

---

## 1. How can I improve the overall speed of running GoogleTest suites?

Improving GoogleTest performance begins with minimizing redundant work and reducing the total amount of test code executed. Here are key approaches:

- **Isolate slow tests:** Identify tests that take a disproportionately long time and consider running them separately or only on demand.
- **Reuse test fixtures wisely:** Share expensive setup resources through test fixtures but avoid unintended dependencies that can slow down or break parallel execution.
- **Use lightweight mocks and avoid unnecessary mocks:** Mocks add overhead. Use them judiciously and avoid overusing mock expectations.
- **Optimize test data:** Avoid loading large test datasets unnecessarily.

Regular profiling of your test runs is crucial to spot bottlenecks.

## 2. How do I run tests in parallel to leverage multi-core CPUs?

GoogleTest supports parallel execution via external tools or test runners that split the test binary or test suites to run concurrently:

- **Divide test binaries:** Split tests into multiple binaries and run each in parallel.
- **Use test sharding or filtering:** Execute different subsets of tests in parallel processes or threads.
- **CI/CD integration:** Configure your continuous integration environment to run tests concurrently.

Make sure your tests are independent to enable safe parallel execution. Avoid shared global state or file locks that can create contention.

> **Tip:** Investigate tools such as `gtest-parallel` or CI platform support to automate test parallelization.

## 3. What causes overhead in large test suites and how can it be minimized?

Large test suites can incur overhead from:

- **Repeated expensive setup and teardown:** If each test creates and destroys heavy resources.
- **Excessive mocking and verification:** Complex expectations slow test execution.
- **Verbose logging and output:** Can increase runtime and clutter logs.
- **Overly strict or numerous expectations:** Leads to longer matching and verification times.

### Best practices to minimize overhead:

- Use `ON_CALL` for default mock behaviors instead of excessive `EXPECT_CALL` to reduce verification cost.
- Place common setup in test fixtures with proper scoping to avoid repetition.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations to retire them when saturated, which reduces matcher lookup time.
- Minimize verbose output unless debugging.
- Consider running very slow or resource-heavy tests less frequently, e.g., nightly builds only.

## 4. How do mock behavior modes affect test performance?

GoogleMock offers three behaviors for uninteresting calls:

- **NaggyMock (default):** Warns on uninteresting calls. This causes runtime overhead because each uninteresting call triggers a warning output.
- **NiceMock:** Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, reducing output and slightly improving performance.
- **StrictMock:** Treats uninteresting calls as failures.

Choose **NiceMock** when uninteresting calls are expected and you want to improve test run speed and reduce noise.

---

## 5. How can I reduce compilation time caused by mocks?

Mocks with many different methods cause longer compile times because of template expansion and generated code.

### Tips:

- **Separate mock class definitions from implementation:** Declare constructors and destructors in headers, but define them in separate `.cc` files.
- **Reduce mock complexity:** Avoid mocking every method unless needed.
- **Use mock class type aliases or simpler interfaces to limit template expansions.**

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Performance">
<Accordion title="Tests take unexpectedly long to run">
Review if tests perform expensive setup/teardown each time. Consider using test fixtures or sharing resources.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Excessive warnings about uninteresting calls">
Switch to `NiceMock` to silence uninteresting calls or ensure proper `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` coverage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock expectations cause slowdowns">
Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire saturated expectations early, and minimize complex matcher expressions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Parallel test runs cause flaky failures">
Check for unintended shared state or dependencies, and isolate tests fully. Use thread-safe methods and synchronization.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Example: Running Tests in Parallel Using gtest-parallel

```bash
# Install gtest-parallel via pip
pip install gtest-parallel

# Run tests in parallel with 8 workers
gtest-parallel path/to/your_test_binary --jobs=8
```

This command runs test cases found in the binary concurrently on 8 threads, reducing overall test latency.

---

## 8. Summary of Best Practices

- Favor test isolation and independence.
- Apply `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior; use `EXPECT_CALL` only for calls you want to verify.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations to speed matcher selection.
- Run slow tests separately or in parallel if possible.
- Choose `NiceMock` to reduce warning noise and improve speed during development.
- Profile test performance and optimize bottlenecks in setup or mock usage.
