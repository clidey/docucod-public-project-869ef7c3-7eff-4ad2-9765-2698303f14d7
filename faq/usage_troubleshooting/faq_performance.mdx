# Performance and Resource Usage FAQ

GoogleMock (gMock) empowers you to write robust C++ unit tests by mocking interfaces and controlling method call behavior during tests. Optimizing the performance of your tests, minimizing resource usage, and efficiently managing large test suites are key to maintaining fast and maintainable CI pipelines and development cycles.

This FAQ focuses on practical strategies to optimize test execution times, minimize resource consumption, and structure your test suites effectively. It covers parallelization approaches, test suite organization, and best practices to get the most out of GoogleMock in scaling scenarios.

## 1. How can I optimize the execution time of tests that use GoogleMock?

Performance optimization primarily involves:

- **Minimizing Mock Setup Cost**: Mock classes generated by `MOCK_METHOD` macros are efficient, but unnecessary complexity in mocks or overly detailed expectations can add overhead. Consider the trade-off between thorough verification and test speed.

- **Reusing Mock Objects**: Creating mocks repeatedly can be costly. When feasible, reuse mock objects across related tests or fixtures.

- **Limiting Over-Specification**: Avoid overly strict expectations which can lead to brittle tests and longer execution times due to redundant verification.

- **Using Nice or Strict Mocks Judiciously**: `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls improving test noise without slowing tests; `StrictMock` makes uninteresting calls fail, which can add overhead from extra validations.

- **Efficient Default Actions**: Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors once instead of setting repetitive expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`.

### Practical Tips

- Keep expectations as simple and focused as possible.
- Use `ON_CALL` for common default mock behaviors, and `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly for verification.
- Avoid complex custom actions unless necessary.


## 2. How can I minimize resource usage when running tests that use gMock mocks?

Resource consumption during tests is impacted by the scope, lifetime, and behavior of mocks:

- **Scope Management**: Use RAII and limit the mock object’s lifespan to only what is needed for the test.

- **Avoid Leaking Mocks**: Leaked mocks prevent verification and consume resources unnecessarily. Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` only when appropriate.

- **Lightweight Mock Interfaces**: Design mocks that only include necessary methods to avoid compilation and runtime overhead.

- **Delay and Lazy Initialization**: Initialize mocks lazily when possible.

- **Minimize Complex Matchers and Actions**: Complex matchers and actions might consume more CPU and memory.


## 3. What strategies can I use to run large test suites efficiently?

Scaling large test suites involves both organizational and infrastructure strategies:

### Parallel Execution

- Use test parallelization and sharding to distribute tests across multiple compute nodes or CPU cores.
- GoogleTest and gMock fully support parallel execution; ensure your tests are thread-safe.

### Selective Execution

- Use test filters to run subsets of tests relevant to your current change.
- Group tests by priority and execution time.

### Test Suite Organization

- Modularize tests to isolate slow or flaky tests.
- Separate unit tests using mocks from longer-running integration or system tests.

### Test Flakiness Management

- Rerun flaky tests selectively using GoogleTest’s `--gtest_repeat` and diagnostic tools.

### Continuous Integration (CI) Tips

- Optimize CI pipeline by balancing test parallelization and machine resource usage.
- Cache builds and test binaries to reduce setup time.

### Example of Parallelization Usage

```bash
# Run tests in parallel batches via sharding
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter="MyTestSuite.*" --gtest_shard_index=0 --gtest_total_shards=4
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter="MyTestSuite.*" --gtest_shard_index=1 --gtest_total_shards=4
...
```


## 4. How can I effectively organize my test suites to improve performance and maintainability?

- **Group Related Tests**: Organize by component or feature.
- **Use Fixtures Effectively**: Share common mock setups, preventing redundant mock initialization.
- **Limit Mock Complexity in Shared Fixtures**: Avoid monolithic mocks that mock many interfaces unless necessary.
- **Decompose Large Test Suites**: Split large, slow-running test suites into smaller units.
- **Use Sequences for Order-Dependent Tests**: Control call ordering only when it matters to prevent brittle tests.


## 5. Can GoogleMock tests be safely run in parallel?

Yes. GoogleMock supports multi-threaded use:

- Mock method invocations and actions occur in the invoking thread.
- You must ensure your *test code* (the test logic outside mocks) runs in a safe threading context, avoiding concurrent modifications of expectations during execution.
- Setting expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL`) must be done by a single thread, before actual calls.
- If mock objects are shared among threads, synchronize access to your test logic accordingly.


## 6. How to deal with flaky tests or tests that have performance bottlenecks related to mocks?

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress unneeded warnings in noisy mocks, reducing output overhead.
- Minimize verified expectations to what is strictly necessary.
- Profile test execution to identify expensive mocks or matchers.
- Break down large tests; mock only critical dependencies.
- Investigate alternative testing approaches like fakes or stubs for complex dependencies.


## 7. Are there any best practices when setting expectations to optimize resource use?

- Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behavior over multiple `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- Set accurate cardinalities with `.Times()` to avoid over-saturation errors that consume extra resources.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to have expectations retire immediately when used up.
- Avoid overlapping expectations that can cause matcher ambiguity or excessive matcher invocations.


## 8. What should I do if I encounter warnings about uninteresting calls or excessive calls?

- Warnings usually indicate a mock method was called without an expectation.
- Review if you intended the method to be called; if yes, consider writing an `EXPECT_CALL` with `.Times(AnyNumber())`.
- If you want to ignore such warnings, use `NiceMock` to suppress.
- Use `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning`, `error`) to control message verbosity.

<Tip>
Parallelizing test execution and careful mock usage are key to efficiently running large GoogleMock test suites. Always profile your test suite to find bottlenecks and tune accordingly.
</Tip>

<Note>
Using `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` appropriately not only improves test clarity but also improves performance by avoiding unnecessary mock call verifications.
</Note>

<Warning>
Avoid setting expectations on mock methods concurrently from multiple threads. Always set expectations before the code under test runs.
