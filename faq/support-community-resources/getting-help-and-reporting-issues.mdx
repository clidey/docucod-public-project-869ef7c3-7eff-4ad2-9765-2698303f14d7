# Getting Help and Reporting Issues

This page guides you on how to obtain support, engage with the GoogleTest community, report bugs, and communicate effectively with maintainers and contributors. It consolidates official help channels, community forums, and best practices for raising issues to ensure prompt and productive assistance.

---

## 1. Official Support Channels

GoogleTest is an open-source project supported primarily through community engagement and issue tracking on GitHub. Hereâ€™s how to get official support and report problems:

### a. GitHub Issues

- **Purpose:** Report bugs, feature requests, or ask for help related to GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- **How to Use:**
  1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to see if your problem or question has already been addressed.
  2. If not found, create a new issue with clear and detailed information.

<Tip>
When opening an issue, provide:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem, including sample code if possible
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your environment details (OS, compiler, build system, GoogleTest version)
- Any error messages, logs, or stack traces
</Tip>

### b. Stack Overflow

- Use the [googletest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) and [google-mock](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-mock) tags.
- Ideal for usage questions, test writing help, and troubleshooting guidance.
- Mention GoogleTest version, minimal reproducible examples, and exact error details.

### c. Mailing Lists and Other Forums

- Currently, GoogleTest does not host official mailing lists.
- Community answers and discussions happen primarily via GitHub and Stack Overflow.

### d. Direct Contact

- Not supported for individual user queries; issues and questions should be raised through the public channels above.

## 2. Best Practices for Reporting Issues

Effective communication accelerates resolution. Follow these guidelines when seeking help:

### a. Prepare Your Environment

- Ensure you are using a recent stable release of GoogleTest.
- Test with the official sample tests to confirm if the issue is reproducible beyond your code.

### b. Isolate the Issue

- Create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example that reproduces the problem.
- Avoid extraneous code or dependencies.

### c. Describe the Problem Clearly

- What did you expect GoogleTest to do?
- What actually happened?
- Include output logs, error messages, or assertion failures.

### d. Specify Your Environment

- OS and version
- Compiler and version
- Build system (CMake, Bazel, etc.) and version
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock version

### e. Follow Issue Format on GitHub

- Use templates if presented.
- Tag the issue appropriately (bug, question, feature request).

### f. Respect Privacy and Security

- Avoid sharing sensitive or proprietary code publicly.
- If you must share private information, seek appropriate channels or sanitize data.

<Note>
Providing detailed information upfront drastically reduces back-and-forth and improves turnaround time.
</Note>

## 3. Community Contributions and Feedback

The GoogleTest project welcomes contributions and feedback via:

- **Pull Requests:** For bug fixes, features, or documentation improvements.
- **Discussions:** Occasionally held in issues or GitHub Discussions if enabled.
- **Code Reviews:** Engage constructively and follow the project's contribution guidelines.

Please consult the [Contributing and Further Learning](faq/support-community-resources/contributing-and-learning-more) page for detailed guidance.

## 4. When You Need Advanced Support

If the community channels do not solve your problem:

- Consider engaging a professional engineer or consultant familiar with GoogleTest.
- Explore third-party support options if available.

The project itself does not provide dedicated enterprise support.

## 6. Summary

Getting help efficiently requires clear communication and the right channel. For issues, GitHub is the primary venue; for usage questions or programming help, Stack Overflow is best. Preparing minimal examples and clear environment details helps maintainers and the community assist you faster and more effectively.
