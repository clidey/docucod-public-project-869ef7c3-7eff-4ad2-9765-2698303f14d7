# Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

Stay up to date with the latest information about the operating systems, compilers, build tools, and C++ standards supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page provides clear guidance to ensure your test environment is compatible and correctly configured to run your tests reliably.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are engineered for broad portability, officially supporting a wide variety of platforms:

- **Linux:** Most major Linux distributions are supported.
- **Windows:** Desktop versions including MSVC and MinGW toolsets.
- **macOS:** Supported for native development environments.
- **Embedded Devices:** Including ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52, Arduino-related platforms.
- **Other Unix-like systems:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, and more.

The framework automatically detects the platform during compilation and adapts behavior accordingly. For embedded platforms, e.g. ESP8266 and ESP32, a minimal test main loop model is provided.


## Supported Compilers and C++ Standards

GoogleTest requires **at least C++17** support from the underlying compiler. The framework enforces this minimum and will generate a compilation error if your compiler is older or doesn't comply:

- **MSVC:** Visual C++ 2015 Update 3 (VS2015.3) or newer.
- **GCC:** Version 5.0 or newer recommended.
- **Clang:** Version 3.4 or newer recommended.
- **Intel:** Supported as available matching these standards.

### Key Compiler Requirements and Flags:

- The compiler must support C++17, including features necessary for GoogleTest internals.
- On MSVC and Clang, default warning levels are increased (`/W4`) for stricter code quality.
- GoogleTest disables RTTI or exception handling flags depending on your build configuration.
- Threading support is detected and enabled automatically via pthreads on UNIX-like systems or Windows primitives on Windows.

Note: Older or non-conforming compilers may fail during build with explicit error messages (e.g., MSVC versions prior to 2015 cause build errors).

## Build Tool Integrations

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with common build systems:

- **CMake:** Comprehensive support with defaults configured for strict warnings, C++17 requirement, thread support, and cross-platform portability.
- **Bazel:** Native GoogleTest and GoogleMock rules exist, simplifying integration.

These build integrations configure the necessary definitions and link to required system libraries, ensuring smooth compilation and linking.


## Platform-Specific Considerations

- On **Windows**, the `main` entry point provided by `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` handles Unicode and the `UNICODE` macro gracefully, including workarounds for MSVC linker issues.
- For **embedded platforms** like ESP8266 and ESP32, a specialized main loop (`setup()` and `loop()` functions) is supported to facilitate test execution within resource-constrained environments.
- **Threading and synchronization** primitives adapt automatically based on platform capability.


## How Compatibility is Determined

GoogleTest uses a combination of preprocessor macros to detect the platform and compiler features, including but not limited to:

- OS detection macros like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`.
- Compiler version macros like `_MSC_VER` for MSVC, `__GNUC__` for GCC, and `__clang__` for Clang.
- C++ language standard version checks to enforce C++17 and above.

This detection governs inclusion of platform-specific headers, availability of features like death tests, stream redirection, and threading.


## Troubleshooting Platform Compatibility

If you encounter build or runtime issues related to platform compatibility, consider these actionable steps:

- **Verify your compiler version:** Make sure it meets the minimum required C++17 standard.
- **Check threading support:** Confirm if your environment has pthreads or equivalent threading libraries if tests require concurrency.
- **Examine build flags:** Ensure that your build system passes appropriate flags to enable exceptions, RTTI (if needed), and disables deprecated warnings incompatibilities.
- **Consult platform defines:** You can define or override platform macros if automatic detection fails, but this is rarely needed.
- **Review embedded platform special cases:** For ESP8266, ESP32, and similar, use the provided main loop pattern.

Refer to the [Installation and Setup guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/installation) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

## Example: Minimal Main Function Differences

### Native Platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Embedded Platforms (ESP8266/ESP32)
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

void setup() {
  testing::InitGoogleMock();  // Initializes both GoogleMock and GoogleTest
}

void loop() {
  RUN_ALL_TESTS();  // Runs all registered tests in a loop
}
```


## Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of platforms, including mainstream desktop OSes and embedded devices, and mandate a minimum of C++17 support. They detect and adapt to the environment for threading, exception handling, and platform-specific entry points. Proper compiler, build toolchain configurations, and following platform-specific guidelines ensure reliable test execution.

If new or less common platforms are used, verify configuration macros and consult troubleshooting guides. Always use the latest supported compiler versions for best experience and compatibility.
