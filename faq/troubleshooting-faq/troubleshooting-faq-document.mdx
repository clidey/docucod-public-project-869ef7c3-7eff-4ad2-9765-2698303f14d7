# Where can I find more troubleshooting tips?

This page consolidates essential troubleshooting resources and guides designed to help you resolve complex or uncommon issues encountered while using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you are facing integration challenges with different IDEs, dealing with intricate test failures, or need guidance on configuring advanced features, the following materials will provide detailed advice and solutions.

---

## 1. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Documentation

GoogleTest and GoogleMock cover a wide range of tests and configurations, which means some issues can be subtle or environment-specific. This section points you to the best resources to systematically identify and fix various problems.

### 1.1 Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues
*Frequently encountered problems during installation, linking, and basic configuration.*
- Check out the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-test-experience/troubleshooting-common-issues) guide to resolve build errors, missing dependencies, and linkage problems.

### 1.2 Test Discovery and Execution Troubleshooting
*When tests are not discovered or executed as expected.*
- Visit [Why aren't my tests being discovered or executed?](/faq/troubleshooting-faq/test-not-discovered-or-executed) for diagnosis steps such as verifying test naming conventions, fixtures, and filter usage.

### 1.3 Build and Integration Issues
*Resolve problems stemming from compiler versions, build tool problems, or linkage errors.*
- Examine [Build or Integration Issues](/faq/troubleshooting-faq/build-integration-issues) for specific scenarios and fixes.

### 1.4 Mocking Issues
*When mocking does not behave as expected, including incorrect expectations or call failures.*
- Refer to [Why does mocking not work as expected?](/faq/troubleshooting-faq/mocking-does-not-work-as-expected) for practical troubleshooting and best practices.

## 2. Advanced Debugging Tips and Tools

For users ready to dive deeper, these advanced topics will help with diagnosing hard-to-find bugs and improving test robustness.

### 2.1 Using Scoped Traces for Better Failure Context
- Make use of [SCOPED_TRACE](../reference/testing.md#SCOPED_TRACE) to add contextual messages to your test failures, aiding in pinpointing the source of issues within nested or repeated calls.

### 2.2 Propagating Fatal Failures in Subroutines
- Understand how GoogleTest treats fatal failures in sub-functions and learn to catch these using `HasFatalFailure()` or `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` in your test code; see usage examples in [Advanced Topics](docs/advanced.md#propagating-fatal-failures).

### 2.3 Capturing Log Messages and Additional Test Properties
- Log extra diagnostic information during test execution using `RecordProperty()`, which is recorded alongside tests and reported in XML and JSON results.

### 2.4 Managing Death Tests
- Death tests run in child processes, which may complicate debugging states; refer to the [Death Tests documentation](guides/beyond-basics/death-tests-and-errors.mdx) for nuanced tips on multithreading and known caveats.

## 3. Integration with IDEs and External Tools

GoogleTest works across platforms and IDEs, but integration may require specific configurations.

- Check your IDE-specific plugin or test runner settings to ensure GoogleTest-based tests are discovered and run correctly.
- For build systems like CMake and Bazel, consult [Integrating with Build and CI Systems](/guides/beyond-basics/integration-build-systems) to set up and troubleshoot.

## 4. Where to Get Further Help

If you cannot find the answer in documentation, try these options:

- Use [Community Resources and Support](/faq/support-and-community/getting-help-support) for forums, mailing lists, and issue trackers.
- Explore the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) for source issues or to submit bug reports.
- Review linked documentation sections such as [GoogleTest Primer](docs/primer.md), [Assertions Reference](docs/reference/assertions.md), and [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](docs/advanced.md) to better understand framework behavior.

---

### Troubleshooting Workflow Example

1. **Verify Setup:** Start with simple test programs and run sanity checks as outlined in the Getting Started path.
2. **Check Naming and Fixtures:** Confirm test macros, test suite names, and fixture usage meet GoogleTest conventions.
3. **Filter and Shard Settings:** Ensure that filters or sharding environment variables are correctly configured.
4. **Enable Verbose Output:** Use flags like `--gtest_brief=0` and enable verbose logging to get detailed failure context.
5. **Use Scoped Traces:** Add `SCOPED_TRACE()` in helper functions to localize failures.
6. **Consult Troubleshooting Guides:** Apply fixes suggested in the troubleshooting documentation linked above.

## Summary

This page serves as your consolidated gateway to GoogleTest's troubleshooting resources. By following the linked guides and adopting debugging best practices, you can address a wide variety of issues efficiently and effectively.

---

## Example: Using SCOPED_TRACE for Debugging

```cpp
void HelperFunction(int index) {
  SCOPED_TRACE(testing::Message() << "Index = " << index);
  EXPECT_EQ(DoWork(index), expected_value);
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, HandlesMultipleCases) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    HelperFunction(i);
  }
}
```
*This results in failure reports including the trace "Index = <value>", helping you identify which iteration failed.*

## Useful Command-Line Flags for Troubleshooting

- `--gtest_list_tests`: Lists all available tests.
- `--gtest_filter=<pattern>`: Runs only tests matching the pattern.
- `--gtest_repeat=<N>`: Repeats tests multiple times to catch flakiness.
- `--gtest_break_on_failure`: Stops on the first assertion failure for interactive debugging.
- `--gtest_output=xml:<file>` or `json:<file>`: Saves detailed test reports.
