# Troubleshooting Mocking Issues

This page addresses common mistakes and confusion around GoogleMock's mock behaviors, the proper use of `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`, mock object lifetimes, and strictness levels with `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`. It is designed to guide you toward clearer understanding and effective solutions for common troubles when working with mocks.

---

## 1. Understanding Mock Behavior: ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL

A fundamental source of confusion is the different purposes of `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`.

- `ON_CALL` sets the **default behavior** of a mock method when it is called with matching arguments. It does **not** imply any expectation or verification that the method must actually be called.
- `EXPECT_CALL` not only sets behavior but also **declares an expectation** that the method will be called a certain number of times with specified arguments. It enforces verification at test teardown or explicit verification.

### Best Practice

- Use `ON_CALL` to configure how your mocks respond by default.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify the method's invocation.

### Example

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;

MockFoo mock;

// Default behavior: GetValue returns 42 when called with any argument.
ON_CALL(mock, GetValue(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));

// Expect GetValue to be called exactly once with argument 5, returning 100.
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue(5)).WillOnce(Return(100));

// Actual code under test.
int value = mock.GetValue(5);  // Returns 100, verified.
int default_value = mock.GetValue(7);  // Returns 42, no verification.
```

---

## 2. Avoid Over-Specifying Expectations

While asserting correctness is critical, excessive or overly strict expectations can make tests brittle and a maintenance burden. Common pitfalls include:

- Using many `EXPECT_CALL`s for methods you don't actually need to verify.
- Setting strict argument matchers where simple wildcards (`_`) would suffice.
- Missing the fact that later `EXPECT_CALL`s override earlier ones for the same method.

### Guidance

- Keep expectations focused on contract properties your test truly cares about.
- Use wildcard matchers (`_`) to ignore unimportant arguments.
- For methods where you don't care about call details, avoid `EXPECT_CALL` and rely on `ON_CALL` defaults.

<Tip>
If your test reports "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings excessively, prefer switching to `NiceMock` for less verbose output rather than blindly adding `EXPECT_CALL`s.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Handling Uninteresting Calls and Mock Strictness

By default, GoogleMock prints warnings for calls to mock methods that have no expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) — these are called **uninteresting calls**.

### Mock Strictness Wrappers

GoogleMock provides three wrapper templates to control this behavior:

- `NiceMock<MockType>`: Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock<MockType>` (default behavior): Prints warnings for uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock<MockType>`: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

### Usage Example

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;

EXPECT_CALL(nice_mock, DoThing());  // Only verifies DoThing call.
strict_mock.DoOtherThing();         // Fails test: uninteresting call.
```

### Caveats

- These wrappers only affect mock methods declared directly within the mock class using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Nesting multiple wrappers like `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockType>>` is not supported.
- Your mock class destructor should be virtual for strictness to work correctly.

<Tip>
Prefer `NiceMock` during normal test development to keep tests maintainable and less brittle. Use `StrictMock` only when you want strict contract adherence.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Errors and Their Causes

### a. Real Object Method Invoked Instead of Mock Method

**Cause:** The method you're trying to mock is not virtual.

**Solution:** Make sure to mock only virtual methods. For non-virtual methods, consider design alternatives such as interface segregation or templated dependency injection.

### b. "Uninteresting Function Call" Warnings Despite Using `ON_CALL`

**Cause:** `ON_CALL` defines default behavior but does not suppress uninteresting call warnings.

**Solution:** Use `NiceMock` wrapper if you want to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls, or explicitly add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(...)).Times(AnyNumber())` for those methods.

### c. Test Fails with Unexpected Calls

**Cause:** The code calls mock methods with arguments that do not match any `EXPECT_CALL`.

**Solution:** Examine your expectations carefully. Use wildcard matchers or add catch-all expectations to cover other expected argument patterns.

### d. Over-Saturation Errors (More Calls than Expected)

**Cause:** The mock method is called more times than specified by `Times()` or inferred cardinality.

**Solution:** Adjust your expected call count or use `Times(AnyNumber())` if you expect calls with no limit.

### e. Unexpected Failures on Mock Object Destruction

**Cause:** Mock object not deleted, or `EXPECT_CALL`s set after object is destroyed.

**Solution:** Ensure mock lifetimes encompass usage, and set all expectations before passing mocks to code under test.

---

## 5. Mock Object Lifetime and Verification

GoogleMock automatically verifies mock expectations when a mock object is destroyed.

**Key points:**

- Set all `EXPECT_CALL`s before passing the mock to the code that exercises it.
- If a mock is allocated on the heap and ownership is transferred, verify it is deleted.
- If you want to verify expectations explicitly before destruction, use:

```cpp
bool success = ::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock);
ASSERT_TRUE(success);
```

- Do **not** set new expectations after verifying or after the mock is destroyed; this causes undefined behavior.

<Tip>
For heap-allocated mocks owned outside your test, consider using `Mock::AllowLeak()` to suppress leak warnings if deletion is not feasible.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Tips for Diagnosing Mock Issues

- Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed logs of all mock calls, matches against expectations, and warnings.
- Use wildcard matchers (`_`) to simplify expectations during diagnosis.
- Check for proper ordering of `EXPECT_CALL`s, especially if using sequences.
- Distinguish between uninteresting calls (no expectation at all) and unexpected calls (expectation exists but call arguments mismatch).
- Enable heap checking and verify mock deletion to avoid tests silently passing despite leaks or missing verifications.

---

## 7. Useful Code Patterns and Examples

### Suppress Warnings for Uninteresting Calls

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
// no warnings on calls without expectations
```

### Expect a Method Never to Be Called

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(0);  // Fails if called
```

### Set Catch-All Expectation with Any Arguments

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### Use ON_CALL to Set Default Behavior

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Method(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

### Expect Ordered Calls

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstMethod());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondMethod());
}
```

### Force Verification Before Mock Destruction

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
```
