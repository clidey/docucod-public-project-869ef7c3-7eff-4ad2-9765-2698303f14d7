# How to Optimize Test Performance and Minimize Overhead

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide powerful tools for testing C++ codebases, but as your test suite grows, performance and execution time become critical. This guide gives practical tips to help you reduce test runtime, manage large test suites efficiently, leverage parallel execution, and address common bottlenecks related to mocks and assertions.

---

## 1. Reducing Test Execution Time

### 1.1 Isolate Expensive Operations
To keep your test suite fast, isolate and minimize expensive setup or teardown operations. Use test fixtures to share costly resources where possible, but avoid performing expensive work per test if it can be done once for a suite.

**Example:**

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_.Connect("url-to-db");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    db_.Disconnect();
  }

  static Database db_;
};
```

This approach ensures the database connection is established once, not per test.

### 1.2 Use Value-Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests
Reduce code duplication by using value-parameterized (`TEST_P`) and type-parameterized tests (`TYPED_TEST`). This avoids writing separate test functions for similar scenarios with different inputs or types, which decreases total compilation and execution time.

### 1.3 Selective Test Execution
Use GoogleTest’s filtering options (`--gtest_filter`) and sharding to run only relevant subsets of tests during development or in CI environments, rather than the entire suite.

```bash
your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyComponent.*
```

### 1.4 Minimize Use of Death Tests
Death tests (`ASSERT_DEATH`) incur significant overhead due to spawning new processes. Use them sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.

---

## 2. Managing Large Test Suites

### 2.1 Organize Tests into Suites
Group related test cases into logical test suites with well-defined fixtures to improve maintainability and allow targeted execution. This also facilitates setup/teardown sharing.

### 2.2 Employ Test Sharding
Distribute tests across multiple machines or CPU cores by setting the environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`.

```bash
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./your_test_binary
```

Each shard runs a disjoint subset of tests, reducing total wall time.

### 2.3 Use Batching and Checkpoints
In complex tests or mocks, use checkpoints and sequences to structure test expectations logically without incurring costly verification overheads.

---

## 3. Leveraging Parallel Test Execution

### 3.1 Parallelize Across Tests
Run multiple tests concurrently when possible. Use build system features (e.g., CTest, Bazel, or Jenkins agents) to dispatch tests in parallel.

### 3.2 Minimize Shared State
Ensure tests are independent and do not share mutable global or static state to avoid race conditions during parallel execution.

### 3.3 Thread Safety with Mocks
GoogleMock supports multi-threaded use of mocks. Follow these best practices:

-  Define expectations before invoking methods concurrently.
-  Avoid changing mock expectations from parallel threads.
-  Allow gMock’s internal locking to handle concurrent method calls.

Refer to the [`StressTest`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/test/gmock_stress_test.cc) for examples of multithreaded use.

## 4. Addressing Mocks and Assertion Bottlenecks

### 4.1 Use NiceMocks to Reduce Unnecessary Checks
By default, uninteresting calls generate warnings, which can add noise and overhead. Change mock behavior using `NiceMock` to suppress these warnings unless explicitly expected.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MyMock> mock;
```

### 4.2 Limit Number and Complexity of EXPECT_CALLs
Complex and numerous `EXPECT_CALL` statements can slow tests. Focus expectations on behavior relevant to the test’s goal and avoid over-specifying.

### 4.3 Use Default Actions (`ON_CALL`) Wisely
Set default mock behaviors with `ON_CALL` rather than `EXPECT_CALL` when behavior is not essential to verify, reducing verification overhead.

### 4.4 Reduce Expensive Matchers
Matchers that do heavy computations or deep container matches can slow tests. Use simple matchers like `_` (wildcard) where detailed verification is unnecessary.

### 4.5 Avoid Side Effects in Matchers and Actions
Matchers and actions should be pure and side-effect free, allowing efficient reuse and evaluation.

### 4.6 Cache and Reuse Complex Actions and Matchers
If you need complex actions or matchers, create them once and reuse to avoid repeated construction overhead.

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

-  **Compile-time Optimization:** Move mock class constructor and destructor definitions to `.cc` files to improve compile times.
-  **Heap Checker:** Enable GoogleTest's heap checker to catch leaks early, especially for mocks.
-  **Verbose Mode:** Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug slow or failing mocks for insight about call matching and expectations.
-  **Test Suite Setup:** Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for expensive global initialization and cleanup.
-  **Limit Global and Static State Manipulation:** Avoid mutable global state to prevent bottlenecks and flaky tests.

---

## 6. Tools and Flags for Monitoring and Profiling

-  **GoogleTest XML/JSON Outputs:** Enable with `--gtest_output=xml:<file>` or `--gtest_output=json:<file>` to generate reports useful for profiling test suite runtime.
-  **GTest Repeat and Shuffle:** Use `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` to detect flaky and order-dependent tests.
-  **Break on Failure:** Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to pause on the first failure for debugging performance issues.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Performance Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Why are my tests running slowly despite mocks?"> 
Mocks with many expectations or complex matchers can slow execution. Simplify expectations and reduce matcher complexity. Avoid unnecessary `WillRepeatedly` actions with heavy computations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My tests slow down with increased parallelism"> 
This may signal contention on shared resources or mutable static state. Ensure tests are independent and synchronize access to shared state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Memory leaks causing slow execution over time"> 
Check that mocks are properly destroyed and verified. Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if mock lifetime is managed externally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Deadlocks or flaky behavior in parallel mocks"> 
Use gMock’s internal locking properly and avoid setting expectations during parallel runs. Keep test setup single-threaded.
