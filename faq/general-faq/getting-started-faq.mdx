# Getting Started: Common Beginners' Questions

Welcome to your first steps using GoogleTest and GoogleMock! This guide addresses the essential questions beginners ask when setting up the framework, writing basic tests, including headers, understanding version requirements, and quickly troubleshooting any installation issues. It ensures you can smoothly build and run your first tests with confidence.

---

## 1. What Is GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

- **GoogleTest** is Google's C++ testing framework that helps you write tests to verify your code behavior efficiently and reliably.
- **GoogleMock** (gMock) is an extension to GoogleTest that provides powerful tools to create mock objects, enabling interaction-based testing.

Together, they form a comprehensive environment for developing well-tested C++ code.

## 2. How Do I Write My First Simple Test?

The first test you write will help you verify functionality quickly. Follow these steps:

1. **Include the Required Header**

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

2. **Write a Test Case Using `TEST()` Macro**

The macro takes two arguments: the test suite name and the test name.

```cpp
TEST(SampleTest, ReturnsTrue) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

3. **Build and Run Your Test**

When you run the tests, GoogleTest will automatically find your test and execute it.

4. **Interpret Results**

If the test passes, you get a success message. If it fails, GoogleTest will show the file and line number, helping you quickly locate issues.

## 3. How Do I Write and Use Test Fixtures?

When you have multiple tests sharing the same setup and teardown, use test fixtures.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialization code here
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup code here
  }

  // Shared resources
  int shared_var_;
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test1) {
  shared_var_ = 5;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_var_, 5);
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test2) {
  // Different test using the same fixture
}
```

- Use `TEST_F()` to indicate tests using the fixture.
- Each test gets a fresh fixture instance.

## 4. What Header Files Should I Include?

- For basic tests: include `<gtest/gtest.h>`
- For mocking capabilities: additionally include `<gmock/gmock.h>`

Both headers provide all the necessary declarations for writing your tests and mocks.

## 5. What Are the Minimum Version Requirements?

- GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports at least **C++17**.
- Ensure your build environment complies with this to avoid compatibility issues.

## 6. How Do I Compile and Link GoogleTest and My Tests?

- If you use **CMake**, the recommended way is to use `FetchContent` to pull GoogleTest and link against provided targets.

Here is a minimal snippet for your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTestProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/main.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gtest_main)

include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(my_tests)
```

- If you do not use CMake or prefer other build systems, refer to your build tool documentation on linking static or shared libraries appropriately.

## 7. Why Does My Test Fail to Link or Run?

Common issues and solutions:

- **Missing pthread support**: On Unix-like systems, GoogleTest needs pthread. Make sure to link with `-lpthread` or equivalent.
- **Wrong compiler flags:** Verify that C++17 or higher is specified.
- **Missing or incorrect build of GoogleTest:** Ensure GoogleTest library files are properly compiled and linked.

## 8. How Can I Quickly Troubleshoot Installation Issues?

- Verify your environment meets prerequisites: platform, compiler version, and dependencies.
- Check that GoogleTest headers and libs are accessible from your build system.
- Run a minimal test (such as the simple test in section 2) to verify basic setup.
- Use verbose build and linking logs to identify missing files or flags.

## 9. How Do I Run Tests?

After building your test binary:

```bash
./my_tests
```

- By default, it runs all defined tests and reports results.
- Use `--gtest_filter=` flag to run a subset of tests.

Example:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=SampleTest.*
```

Outputs detailed information about passes and failures for diagnosis.

## 10. Where Can I Find More Help?

- **GoogleTest Primer:** Get started writing unit tests.
- **gMock for Dummies:** Learn the basics of mocking.
- **Mocking Reference:** Understand how to define and control mocks.
- **gMock Cookbook:** Advanced patterns and recipes.
- **Troubleshooting Guide:** Resolve build and integration issues.

You can find the above documents in the official GoogleTest documentation and on the project's website.

### Quick Example to Get You Started

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple test verifying basic equality.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);  // Placeholder for factorial(0)
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and run this to ensure your setup works!

### Helpful Tips & Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_` macros for non-fatal test failures allowing tests to continue.
- Use `ASSERT_` macros to abort a test early if continuing is unsafe.
- Keep tests independent and idempotent.
- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) to share setup.
- Set expectations on mocks **before** exercising the code under test.

<Info>
Ensure your compiler supports at least C++17 and that pthread is available on your platform for multithreaded tests.

<Warning>
Setting expectations on mock methods must happen before the methods are called to avoid undefined behavior.
</Warning>

<Check>
Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return value as the exit code in your main function to correctly report test results.
