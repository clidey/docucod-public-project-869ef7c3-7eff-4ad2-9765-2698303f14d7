# Test Discovery, Structure, and Execution FAQ

This FAQ addresses common questions about how GoogleTest discovers tests, how to best organize test files and suites within a project, methods to run test subsets, and the management of the `main()` function for test execution. It guides users through best practices for structuring test code and ensures smooth and efficient test runs.

---

## 1. How does GoogleTest discover tests in my project?

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests defined using its core macros (e.g., `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`) from all linked object files when you run the test binary. You do *not* need to manually register or list tests.

- All tests compiled into your test executable are registered on startup.
- The discovery relies on static initialization that happens before `main()` calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

This means a typical workflow is:

- Write one or more test source files containing `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Compile and link them into a single executable.
- Run that executable to execute all tests.

### Practical Tip

Ensure your test files actually get compiled and linked into the test binary. If a source file with tests is not linked in, its tests will not be discovered.

---

## 2. How should I organize my test files and test suites?

### File Organization

- Create separate test source files (_e.g._, `foo_test.cc`, `bar_test.cc`) corresponding to components or modules under test.
- Place tests close to their source code modules when possible, typically under a `test/` or `tests/` directory.

### Test Suites and Naming

- Group related tests into test suites sharing a name prefix in the first argument to `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`. For example:

```cpp
TEST(Foo, DoesThis) { ... }
TEST(Foo, HandlesThat) { ... }
```

- Use descriptive test names to clarify what scenario is being tested.

### Using Test Fixtures

When multiple tests require common setup and teardown code, use `TEST_F()` with test fixture classes derived from `testing::Test`.

### Best Practice

Organize tests to mirror your production code structure. This improves maintainability and helps team members locate related tests quickly.

---

## 3. Can I run only some tests, not all of them?

Yes, GoogleTest offers several ways to run a subset of tests:

### Filtering by Test Name

Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to specify which tests to run by test suite and/or test name patterns.

- Run a single test:

  ```bash
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=Foo.DoesThis
  ```

- Run all tests in a suite:

  ```bash
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=Foo.*
  ```

- Exclude tests:

  ```bash
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=-Bar.*
  ```

- Combine inclusions and exclusions:

  ```bash
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=Foo.*-Foo.SlowTest
  ```

### Running by Command-Line Arguments

`testing::InitGoogleTest()` parses `argv` to initialize GoogleTest and processes filters before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` starts running tests.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

To integrate with CI pipelines, you can script runs with filtered tests or use `ctest` with CMake and GoogleTest.

## 4. How does the `main()` function work with GoogleTest?

Most users do *not* need to write their own `main()` function because GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer a ready-made `main()` implementation:

- Linking against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries provides a `main()` that:
  - Calls `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` (and for gMock, `testing::InitGoogleMock`).
  - Runs all tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
  - Returns the aggregated test result as program exit code.

### When to Write a Custom `main()`

Write your own `main()` only when you must perform special initialization or setup not expressible through test fixtures or environment objects.

A typical custom `main()` looks like:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  // Custom setup here
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Practical Note

Always return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from `main()`. This lets CI systems detect test results correctly based on exit status.

---

## 5. How are tests executed internally after discovery?

Once `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called:

- GoogleTest iterates over all registered tests sequentially or according to filter rules.
- For each test:
  - Constructs a fresh test fixture (if any).
  - Calls `SetUp()`.
  - Runs the test body.
  - Calls `TearDown()`.
  - Destroys the fixture.

This ensures test isolation and repeatability.

### Running Tests in Parallel

GoogleTest can be integrated with external tools and CI runners to enable parallel execution of test binaries. Inside a single executable, tests run serially by default.

For large projects, consider splitting tests into multiple executables or leveraging test sharding features in your CI.

---

## 6. What are best practices for structuring and managing the `main()` function?

- Prefer linking with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` unless the application requires custom startup logic.
- If implementing your own `main()`, keep it simple:
  - Call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` (or `InitGoogleMock()` if you use mocks).
  - Return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Avoid calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` more than once in the same execution.
- Use `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` to properly parse command line flags and initialize the framework.
- In embedded or special platform cases (e.g., Arduino, ESP), specialized lifecycle hooks (`setup()`, `loop()`) may be needed; refer to platform-specific documentation.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips for Test Discovery and Execution

- **No tests found:** Ensure test files are compiled and linked into your test executable.
- **Tests not running:** Confirm `main()` calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- **Filtering excludes all tests:** Validate your `--gtest_filter` syntax.
- **Unexpected behavior with test fixtures:** Remember a fresh fixture instance is created per test.
- **Linker errors involving `main()`:** Avoid multiple definitions; use provided `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries or ensure single `main()`.
