## How do I debug and interpret failing tests?

Understanding why your tests fail and how to effectively debug them is essential for productive use of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide focuses on interpreting common test failure outputs, diagnosing failure modes related to mock expectations, and using advanced GoogleMock debugging tools to pinpoint issues swiftly.

---

### 1. Understanding Test Failure Output

When a test fails, GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide detailed messages about the failure cause. These messages include:

- The failed assertion or expectation.
- Function calls and their argument values.
- The number of times a mock method was called relative to expectations.
- Error messages for unexpected or uninteresting mock calls.
- Stack traces when running with higher verbosity levels.

These messages guide you toward identifying whether the failure is due to:

- Incorrectly specified expectations (`EXPECT_CALL` mismatches).
- Calls made out-of-order with respect to `InSequence` or `After` clauses.
- Too many or too few calls relative to the specified cardinality.
- Unexpected or uninteresting mock function invocations.

---

### 2. Common Failure Scenarios in Mock Tests

#### Unexpected Calls

Occurs when a mock method is called without any matching `EXPECT_CALL` statement. GoogleMock:

- Reports the unexpected call with argument values.
- Prints all expectations attempted to be matched and why they failed.
- Returns the default value for the mock method's return type (or does nothing for void).

Example output snippet:
```text
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: DoB(2)
Google Mock tried the following 1 expectation, but it didn't match:
  Expected arg #0: is equal to 1
           Actual: 2
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: called once - saturated and active
```

#### Excessive Calls

Happen when a mock method is called more times than specified by `Times()` or inferred from `WillOnce()`. GoogleMock:

- Warns that calls exceed the expected count.
- Returns default values for calls beyond the specified limit.

Example output snippet:
```text
Mock function called more times than expected - returning default value.
    Function call: DoB(2)
          Returns: 0
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: called twice - over-saturated and active
```

#### Uninteresting Calls

Calls to mock methods with no `EXPECT_CALL` matching the invocation but where `ON_CALL` may specify default actions. Depending on mock type:

- **NaggyMock**: Issues warnings about uninteresting calls.
- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as errors.

Example output snippet:
```text
GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Bar2(0, 1)
          Returns: false
NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen.
```

#### Unsatisfied Expectations

Occur when expected calls aren't made the required number of times. GoogleMock:

- Reports the expected cardinality versus actual call count.
- Shows the exact expectation that wasn't met.

Example output snippet:
```text
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(b, DoB(5))...
         Expected: to be called at least twice
           Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active
```

### 3. Using Verbosity Flags for Advanced Debugging

GoogleMock offers a `--gmock_verbose=LEVEL` flag to adjust the detail of mock call logging:

- `info`: Logs all calls, matched expectations, and warnings with stack traces.
- `warning`: Logs only warnings and errors, omitting stack traces in uninteresting call warnings (default).
- `error`: Logs only errors, suppressing warnings and informational output.

Set this flag to `info` to gain insight into which expectations matched which calls and see live traces of calls.

Example usage:
```
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This level helps uncover subtle mismatches or unexpected call patterns by showing
- Every `EXPECT_CALL` entered,
- Every matching method call,
- Which expectation matched each call,
- The call arguments and returned values,
- Stack traces for context.

### 4. Debugging Flow: Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Analyze Failure Messages">
Read the failure log carefully to identify: unexpected calls, call counts, unmatched arguments, or ordering violations.
</Step>
<Step title="Match Arguments and Expectations">
Check argument values against your `EXPECT_CALL` matchers. Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see exactly which expectations are matched.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Call Order and Cardinality">
Ensure calls follow sequences (`InSequence`) and occur expected number of times (`Times()`).
</Step>
<Step title="Review Uninteresting and Excessive Calls">
Consider if you need to suppress warnings by using `NiceMock` or adjust expectations.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Stack Traces for Context">
Enable verbose logging to see stack traces of calls for identifying their origin in code.
</Step>
<Step title="Incremental Debugging">
Add intermediate `EXPECT_CALL`s with `.Times(AnyNumber())` to isolate failing calls.
</Step>
</Steps>

### 5. Best Practices to Minimize Flaky Tests and Failures

- Use `ON_CALL()` to specify common default behaviors and avoid surprises from uninteresting calls.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL()` sparingly to only verify interactions you truly depend on.
- Prefer `NiceMock` when uninteresting calls are expected to reduce noise.
- Order expectations explicitly only when necessary using `InSequence` or `After`.
- Validate arguments with precise matchers to avoid mismatches.
- Avoid overusing `.Times(AnyNumber())` as it may mask errors.
- Verify and clear expectations programmatically if mock objects live beyond test scope.

### 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common pitfalls when interpreting failing tests">
<Accordion title="Ignoring Uninteresting Call Warnings">
Ignoring warnings about uninteresting calls without understanding them may hide bugs. Use `NiceMock` to suppress them when appropriate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mismatched Argument Expectations">
Argument matchers that are too restrictive or incorrect cause unexpected call failures. Revalidate your matchers using verbose logs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect Call Order Enforcement">
Using sequences without understanding the actual call order may cause spurious failures. Apply sequences only when order truly matters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Improper Times() Configuration">
Omitting or misusing cardinalities leads to confusing overcall or undercall errors. Set `.Times()` explicitly when in doubt.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Forgetting to Verify or Clear Mocks">
Leaked mocks cause silent expectation failures. Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to force verification.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 7. Interpreting Example Failure Messages

Here are some typical GoogleMock failure logs and their meanings:

#### Unexpected Call

```text
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Foo(9)
Google Mock tried the following 1 expectation, but it didn't match:
  Expected arg #0: is equal to 1
           Actual: 9
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: called once - saturated and active
```

Means your test expected `Foo(1)`, but `Foo(9)` was called instead.

#### Excessive Call

```text
Mock function called more times than expected - returning default value.
    Function call: Bar(0)
          Returns: 0
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: called twice - over-saturated and active
```

Indicates `Bar(0)` was called twice, but expected only once.

#### Uninteresting Call Warning

```text
GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning directly.
    Function call: Baz(4)
NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen.
```

Means `Baz` was called but no `EXPECT_CALL` matched; gMock took default action.

### 8. Additional Diagnostic Tools

- **Checkpoints**: Use mock methods as checkpoints within call sequences to verify partial behaviors.
- **Verbose Logging**: Adjust `--gmock_verbose` level to control logging detail.
- **Stack Traces**: Capture call stack information at each mock invocation.
- **Mock Verification API**: Explicitly invoke `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to validate mocks before destruction.
