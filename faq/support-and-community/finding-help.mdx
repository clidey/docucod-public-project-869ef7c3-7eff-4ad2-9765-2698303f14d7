# Where to Get Help and Report Issues

GoogleTest is a widely used, open-source C++ testing framework supported by an active community and official resources. When you encounter advanced or persistent problems, this page guides you through the best avenues for getting help, filing effective bug reports, and engaging with the community.

## 1. Official Support Channels

### 1.1 GitHub Issues

- **Purpose:** Submit bug reports, feature requests, and ask technical questions related to GoogleTest.
- **Location:** [GoogleTest GitHub Repository Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)
- **Tips for Submitting Good Issues:**
  - Clearly describe the problem or feature.
  - Include minimal reproducible code snippets or test cases.
  - Provide platform details, compiler versions, and relevant environment information.
  - Check for existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.

### 1.2 GoogleTest Mailing Lists and Forums

- While GoogleTest itself primarily uses GitHub for issue tracking, some users use forums and mailing lists for advanced discussions.
- Search online or in developer communities like Stack Overflow tagged with `googletest` for community-provided solutions.

## 2. Filing Effective Bug Reports

An effective bug report helps maintainers understand and resolve your issues quickly:

### Step-by-Step Guidance:

<Steps>
<Step title="Describe the Problem Clearly">
Detail what you expected and what actually happened. Include error messages or unexpected behaviors.
</Step>
<Step title="Provide Minimal Reproducible Examples">
Include the smallest code sample necessary to reproduce the issue. Prefer including a test case that triggers the problem.
</Step>
<Step title="Detail Your Environment">
Mention your operating system, compiler type and version, C++ standard version used, GoogleTest version, build system (CMake/Bazel/others), and any special configurations.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Existing Issues">
Search the GitHub issues to see if a similar problem has already been reported or resolved.
</Step>
<Step title="Follow the Template">
When opening an issue on GitHub, follow the issue template provided to ensure all relevant information is included.
</Step>
<Step title="Attach Logs and Outputs">
Add test output, build logs, or error messages in clear, formatted blocks. Use GitHub's markdown capabilities to format code snippets.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Providing a minimal yet complete test code that reproduces the issue is the fastest way to get help.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Pitfalls When Seeking Help

- Not including enough context such as platform, compiler, or build configuration.
- Providing vague or overly broad descriptions without concrete examples.
- Omitting error messages or logs.
- Mixing GoogleTest questions with unrelated C++ or build system issues.

To avoid these pitfalls, prepare your environment details and a minimal failing example before asking.
