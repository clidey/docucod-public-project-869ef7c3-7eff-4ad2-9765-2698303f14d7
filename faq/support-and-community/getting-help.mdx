## How to Get Help

### GitHub Discussions

GoogleTest’s GitHub repository has a **Discussions** tab where you can:

- Ask detailed questions.
- Share your experience or best practices.
- Discuss feature ideas and improvements.

Please search existing threads before posting to avoid duplicates.

### GitHub Issue Tracker

**Use the issue tracker for:

- Bug reports.
- Feature requests.**

When submitting an issue, provide:

- Clear and descriptive summary.
- Detailed reproduction steps or minimal, complete example.
- Environment details including OS, compiler, and GoogleTest version.
- Relevant code snippets and test output.

This helps maintainers understand and prioritize your issue efficiently.

### Mailing Lists

Subscribe to mailing lists for announcements and community Q&A:

- Look for links in the GitHub repository README or official website.
- Mailing lists are quieter but useful for long-form discussion.

### Community Forums and Other Resources

   - GoogleTest version (e.g., v1.17.0).
   - Compiler and build system details (CMake, Bazel, flags).
   - Operating system and version.
   - Steps to reproduce, including minimal code.
   - Exact error messages/output.

3. **Follow the Issue Template**
   - The repository provides templates guiding what information to provide.

4. **Be Clear and Concise**

   - Avoid extraneous information that does not help reproduce or understand the bug.

5. **Stay Engaged**
   - Respond promptly to maintainers’ requests for clarification.

## Example of a Good Bug Report

```markdown
Title: Unexpected failure when running ASSERT_DEATH on Windows with Visual Studio 2019

Description:
When running ASSERT_DEATH macro in a specific test, the process hangs and the test does not complete.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Build GoogleTest v1.17.0 with Visual Studio 2019
2. Run sample death tests from sample4_unittest.cc including ASSERT_DEATH macro
3. Observe that the tests hang instead of completing.

Environment:
- OS: Windows 10 64-bit
- Compiler: MSVC 2019 version 16.6
- Build system: CMake 3.18
- GoogleTest version: 1.17.0

Additional info:
- The problem does not occur with gtest built with static CRT
- Using `-DGTEST_FORCE_SHARED_CRT=1` resolves the issue.
```
