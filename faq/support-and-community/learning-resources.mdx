## Practical Tips

- Leverage the **gMock verbose flags** (`--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error`) during test runs to get detailed insights on mock behavior (see [Mocking Reference # Flags](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/mocking.md#flags)).
- Use **NiceMock**, **NaggyMock**, or **StrictMock** to control warnings and errors on unexpected mock method calls (explained in the [Mocking Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/mocking.md#nicemask-naggymask-strictmock)).
- Design tests with sequences and ordering constraints using **InSequence** and **After** clauses for precise call ordering verification.
