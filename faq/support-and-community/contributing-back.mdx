# How can I contribute improvements or report issues?

Contributing to GoogleTest is a valuable way to enhance the framework, fix bugs, and improve documentation. This guide walks you through the process of submitting bug reports, feature requests, and documentation enhancements while pointing to helpful contributor guides and community standards.

---

## Overview

Whether you have found a bug, want to request a new feature, or submit improvements to the codebase or documentation, contributing to GoogleTest results in a better product for the entire community.

We encourage contributions across all levels of complexityâ€”from reporting simple issues to sending pull requests with code or documentation fixes.

## How to Report Issues

When you identify a bug or problem with GoogleTest, follow these steps to report it effectively:

1. **Search Existing Issues:**
   Before opening a new issue, make sure to search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to check if the problem has already been reported or fixed.

2. **Clear and Descriptive Title:**
   Choose a concise, yet descriptive title capturing the essence of the problem.

3. **Detailed Description:**
   Provide as much detail as possible including:
   - GoogleTest version.
   - Your environment (OS, compiler version).
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Expected and actual behavior.
   - Any relevant logs or error messages.

4. **Minimal Reproducible Example:**
   If possible, include a small snippet of code that triggers the problem. This helps maintainers quickly understand and verify the issue.

5. **Label the Issue Appropriately:**
   If you have permissions, use appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `documentation`, `feature-request`) to help organize issues.

## Requesting Features or Enhancements

If you have an idea to improve GoogleTest: 

- Clearly describe the feature or enhancement's purpose and value.
- Explain how it benefits users and fits within the framework's goals.
- If possible, suggest an approach or usage example.
- Discuss any relevant alternatives or existing workarounds.

Feature discussions typically begin as GitHub issues where maintainers and the community can weigh in.

## Contributing Code and Documentation

GoogleTest welcomes pull requests that bring value through bug fixes, new features, improved documentation, or tests.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   Create your own copy of the GoogleTest repository on GitHub.

2. **Clone and Set Up:**
   Clone your fork locally and set up the build environment following the instructions in the [googletest/README.md](googletest/README.md).

3. **Create a Branch:**
   Work on a dedicated branch with a descriptive name.

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   Ensure your modifications follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and existing project conventions.

5. **Test Your Changes:**
   Run existing tests and add new tests if appropriate. Documentation changes should be validated and clear.

6. **Commit with Clear Messages:**
   Write clear, concise commit messages describing the change.

7. **Push and Open a Pull Request:**
   Push your branch and open a pull request against the `main` branch.

### Guidelines

- Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Follow the existing project's commit and coding standards.
- Make sure the PR is focused and not overly large.
- Document your changes thoroughly, especially for new behaviors.
