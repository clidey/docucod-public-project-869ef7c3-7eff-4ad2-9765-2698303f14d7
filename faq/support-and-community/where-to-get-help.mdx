# Getting Support & Finding Help

GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer robust testing and mocking capabilities, but sometimes you may encounter issues or need expert guidance beyond what documentation and FAQs provide. This page directs you to the official help channels, community resources, and issue trackers where you can find timely assistance and the latest troubleshooting advice.

---

## Official Support Channels

### GitHub Issue Tracker

- **Primary place to report bugs, issues, or feature requests:**

  Use the [GoogleTest GitHub repository Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) for submitting detailed reports.

- **Tips for effective issue reporting:**

  1. Search existing issues before opening a new one — your problem might have been resolved or discussed previously.
  2. Provide a minimal, reproducible example demonstrating the problem.
  3. Include details such as operating system, compiler version, GoogleTest/GoogleMock version, and exact error messages.
  4. Mention steps you've taken to troubleshoot or workarounds you've tried.

### Mailing Lists and Official Forums

While GoogleTest does not maintain an official mailing list, many users discuss issues on developer forums like Stack Overflow.

- Use the tag [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`gmock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gmock) in Stack Overflow to search and ask questions.

- Check [Google Testing Blog](https://testing.googleblog.com/) for announcements, tips, and insights from the maintainers.

### Internal Google Support

Google employees may have access to company-specific internal support channels; external users should use GitHub and public community forums.

## Community Resources

### Stack Overflow

- Highly active community for GoogleTest and GoogleMock support
- Questions tagged with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`gmock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gmock)

### Google Groups and Forums

- Some legacy discussions may exist in Google Groups forums; however, active support happens mostly on GitHub and Stack Overflow.

### Gitter, Discord, or Slack Channels

- Occasionally, third-party groups host chat channels; these are unofficial and vary in activity.

### Blogs and Tutorials
