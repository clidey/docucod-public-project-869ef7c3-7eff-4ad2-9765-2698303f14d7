## Official Documentation

Google provides an extensive collection of documentation to help users understand and utilize GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively:

- **Getting Started Guides:** Step-by-step tutorials on installation and initial tests.
- **Guides & Best Practices:** Covers writing tests, building mocks, custom matchers/actions, and advanced mocking techniques.
- **API Reference:** Detailed technical information covering core testing APIs, mocking APIs, and platform configurations.
- **FAQs:** Answers common questions on usage, integration, troubleshooting, and performance.

You can access these resources typically via the [GoogleTest documentation website](https://google.github.io/googletest/).


## Community & Support Forums

Engage with a lively community of developers and testers who contribute solutions, discuss best practices, and share experiences:

- **GitHub Issues:** The primary venue for reporting bugs, requesting features, or discussing specific challenges. When opening an issue, provide a clear description, steps to reproduce, environment details, and expected vs actual behavior.

- **Stack Overflow:** Tag your questions with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`gmock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gmock) to reach a broad audience.

- **Mailing Lists & Chat:** Some communities maintain mailing lists or chat channels (Slack, Discord) for quicker informal help.


## How to File Bug Reports and Feature Requests

A well-constructed report accelerates resolution and reduces back-and-forth. Follow these best practices:

### Bug Reports

1. **Clear Title:** Summarize the issue succinctly.
2. **Environment Details:** OS, compiler version, GoogleTest/GoogleMock version.
3. **Minimal Reproducible Example:** Provide compact, self-contained code snippets demonstrating the problem.
4. **Expected vs Actual Behavior:** What you expected to happen and what actually occurred.
5. **Log or Error Messages:** Complete text from build logs or test failures.
6. **Steps Tried:** Mention any troubleshooting attempts to avoid duplicated advice.

### Feature Requests

1. **Description:** Explain the feature's purpose and how it will improve workflows.
2. **Use Case:** Provide real-world scenarios where this feature adds value.
3. **Existing Workarounds:** Mention if there are any, and their limitations.
4. **Priority:** If applicable, indicate urgency or impact on your projects.


## Additional Tips for Getting Help

- Before posting, search existing issues, FAQs, and forums to avoid duplicates.
- Use clear, jargon-free language describing the problem or question.
- Include relevant links to your code repository or gist if possible.
- When reporting flaky or intermittent issues, provide context about frequency and environment changes.

## Example: Filing a Bug Report

Here’s an example template to guide your bug filing process:

```markdown
### Title
Mock does not verify EXPECT_CALL on inherited const method

### Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Compiler: GCC 11.2
- GoogleTest Version: v1.11.0

### Steps to Reproduce
Please see this minimal example:
```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int GetValue() const = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(FooTest, VerifyCall) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue());
  // Forgot to call mock.GetValue();
  // Expectation is verified on destruction and should fail
}
```

### Expected Behavior
Test fails because EXPECT_CALL is not satisfied.

### Actual Behavior
Test passes without errors.

### Additional Info
Checked with --gmock_verbose=info but no warnings.
```
