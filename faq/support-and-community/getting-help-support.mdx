# Where can I get help or support?

If you're using GoogleTest and need help or support, several official channels and resources are available to assist you. This page consolidates the primary avenues where you can find official documentation, report issues, or engage with the community.

---

## Official Documentation Site

The most comprehensive and up-to-date resource for GoogleTest is the official documentation website. It includes all user guides, reference manuals, tutorials, and FAQs to help you understand and effectively use GoogleTest.

- **Website:** [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/)
- **Starting point:** GoogleTest Primer — for a beginner-friendly introduction

The documentation site is optimized for progressive mastery, from writing your first tests to advanced features such as parameterized and typed tests, mocking, death tests, and test lifecycle management.


## Mailing Lists and Community Forums

While there is no explicit mailing list documented in the core product files, community-supported forums and issue trackers serve as valuable platforms for questions and discussions:

- **GitHub Issues:** The main avenue to report bugs, request features, or seek technical assistance.
  - [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)
  - When reporting, please provide detailed information including your platform, compiler version, error messages, and minimal reproducible examples.

- **Discussion Forums:** While GoogleTest doesn’t maintain an official forum, you can find discussions and questions on platforms such as Stack Overflow.
  - Tag your questions with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) for better visibility.

- **Mailing List Contact:** For direct development discussions and announcements, GoogleTest uses the email `googletestframework@googlegroups.com`.
  - Use this for reporting serious bugs or contributing patches.


## Issue Trackers and Bug Reporting

GoogleTest's issue tracker on GitHub is the official place to report bugs or request new features.

### How to effectively report an issue:

1. **Search for existing issues:** Before creating a new issue, check if your problem or suggestion has been reported.
2. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** Make it easy for maintainers to understand and reproduce your problem.
3. **Include environment details:** OS, compiler version, GoogleTest version, build system.
4. **Describe the expected vs actual behavior:** Clearly articulate what you expected and what actually happened.
