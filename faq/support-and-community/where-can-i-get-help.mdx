## Official Support Channels

### GitHub Issue Tracker

The primary venue to report bugs, request features, or track known issues is the GoogleTest GitHub repository's issue tracker:

- **Repository:** [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

When filing an issue:

- Provide a clear and descriptive title.
- Include details about your environment: operating system, compiler version, GoogleTest version.
- Supply reproducible examples or minimal test cases demonstrating the problem.
- Detail the expected behavior versus actual behavior.
- Reference relevant documentation or error messages.

Following this structured approach ensures maintainers can efficiently assess and address your issue.

### Discussion Forums and Mailing Lists

While there isn't a dedicated GoogleTest forum, users often turn to various developer communities for help, including:

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest): Use the `googletest` tag to ask technical questions.
- Google Groups or C++ community mailing lists that cover testing frameworks.

These platforms are effective for troubleshooting, sharing best practices, and gaining advice from experienced users.

### Official Documentation

For self-service help:

- **User's Guide:** [https://google.github.io/googletest/](https://google.github.io/googletest/)
- **FAQ:** [https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/faq.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/faq.md)
- **API Reference:** Comprehensive details for assertions, mocking, and more.

Consult these to resolve common questions and deepen understanding.
