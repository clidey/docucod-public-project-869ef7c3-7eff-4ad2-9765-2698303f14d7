## Example: How to instantiate a NiceMock

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::NiceMock;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (int), ());
};

int main() {
  NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
  mock.Bar(5);
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `NiceMock` object that suppresses warnings from uninteresting calls.
