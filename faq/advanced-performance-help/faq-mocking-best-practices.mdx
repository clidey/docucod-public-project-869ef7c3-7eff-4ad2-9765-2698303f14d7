# Best Practices for Using GoogleMock Effectively

This guide distills essential best practices and patterns for leveraging GoogleMock effectively in your C++ testing workflow. It focuses on how to write maintainable, robust mock-based tests by applying proven techniques around mock behavior, expectations, and test design.

---

## 1. Understand Mock Object Behavior and Expectations

### Clearly Distinguish Between `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors for mock methods when you donâ€™t need to verify the call.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when your test must verify that a method is called with particular arguments, the number of times, or in a certain sequence.

> **Why?** Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` over-constrains tests and makes refactoring harder. Balancing `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` improves test resilience.

### Avoid Over-Specifying Arguments and Cardinalities
- Use argument matchers like `_` (wildcard) or simple predicates to focus only on the relevant arguments.
- Avoid setting strict counts unless absolutely necessary. For example, use `.Times(AnyNumber())` for methods called unexpectedly but harmlessly.

### Prefer Setting Expectations Before Calling Mocked Methods
- Always set expectations via `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising the code under test.
- Setting expectations after the mock is in use leads to undefined and unreliable behavior.

---

## 2. Use Mock Strictness Modifiers Wisely

GoogleMock provides wrappers to control how uninteresting calls (calls without expectations) are treated:

- **`NiceMock`**: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls. Ideal for most testing scenarios where you want clean logs and are not verifying every call.
- **`NaggyMock`** (default): Prints warnings when uninteresting calls occur.
- **`StrictMock`**: Treats uninteresting calls as failures, enforcing strict adherence to expectations.

### Best Practice:
- Use `NiceMock` for most tests to reduce noise while still verifying expected calls.
- Use `NaggyMock` selectively during test development or debugging.
- Use `StrictMock` sparingly when enforcing the highest test accuracy.

---

## 3. Organize Expectations to Reflect Real Behavior

### Order Matters
- Later `EXPECT_CALL`s override earlier ones. Put more specific expectations *after* more general ones.
- If you care about call order, use `InSequence` or `After` to explicitly sequence expectations.

### Using Sequences & Partial Orders
- Use `InSequence` objects to enforce strict call orders when needed.
- Use multiple `Sequence` instances and `.InSequence(s1, s2)` to express partial orders, allowing flexible test designs.

### Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to Avoid Sticky Expectations
- By default, expectations remain active even after their call count is met.
- Mark expectations with `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to have them retire immediately after saturation, preventing unexpected failures in subsequent calls.

---

## 4. Design Mocks and Tests for Maintainability

### Mock the Interface, Not Concrete Classes
- Prefer coding to interfaces with virtual methods rather than mocking concrete classes directly.
- This reduces test fragility when underlying implementations evolve.

### Delegate Mock Calls When Appropriate
- Delegate default behaviors to existing fakes or real objects using `ON_CALL` with lambdas.
- This ensures your tests simulate realistic behavior while verifying interactions.

### Handle Overloaded and Const Methods Explicitly
- Mock all overloaded variants that will be called.
- Use `Const()` helper to disambiguate expectations on const overloads.

### Use Aliases or Parentheses Around Complex Types in MOCK_METHOD
- To prevent parsing errors, wrap return types or argument types with commas inside parentheses or use type aliases.

---

## 5. Writing Robust Mock Actions

### Compose Actions When Needed
- Use `DoAll()` to chain multiple side effects and a return value.
- Use lambdas or functors for complex behaviors.

### Use Move-Only Type Support Properly
- Mock methods taking or returning move-only types directly with `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Return fresh objects in lambdas to avoid move-after-move errors.

### Use Argument Matchers and Selectors
- Use matchers like `Pointee`, `Field`, and `Property` to verify specific argument members.
- Use `With()` clause to match arguments collectively (e.g., when relationships between parameters matter).

---

## 6. Debugging and Diagnosing Expectation Failures

### Enable Verbose Logging
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed logs of mock calls and matching expectations.
- Combine with `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=0` if you want only call traces without stack traces.

### Understand the Difference Between Unexpected and Uninteresting Calls
- Unexpected calls are calls that do not match known expectations and cause failures.
- Uninteresting calls have no expectations but are allowed; warnings can be controlled with strictness wrappers.

### Verify and Clear Expectations Explicitly
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` to verify a mock outside its destructor.
- Do not set expectations after verification to avoid undefined behavior.

---

## 7. Performance and Efficiency Tips

### Move Heavy Mock Class Methods Out-of-Line
- Define mock constructors and destructors in a `.cc` file to speed up compilation.

### Use Catch-All Expectations Strategically
- Use catch-all expectations with `.Times(AnyNumber())` to avoid unnecessary failures but still enforce key calls.

### Balance Verbose Logging
- Verbose output helps debugging but slows tests.
- Adjust verbosity for routine test runs to reduce noise and expedite execution.

# Example: Creating a NiceMock with Ordered Expectations

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::InSequence;

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLineSegment) {
  NiceMock<MockTurtle> turtle;

  {
    InSequence seq;  // Enforce call order
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
  }

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  painter.DrawLineSegment(100);
}
```

This test suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls not explicitly mocked, ensures proper order, and validates important interactions.

# Summary
By applying these best practices, you create maintainable, robust, and easy-to-understand tests using GoogleMock. The focus is on setting appropriate expectations, using strictness modifiers judiciously, ordering expectations properly, writing clear mock actions, and understanding mock call diagnostics.
