# Test Suite Performance and Optimization FAQ

This FAQ helps you understand how to improve the speed and resource efficiency of your GoogleTest test suites, focusing on practical strategies and user-centric workflows. Whether you maintain a small project or a large codebase with hundreds or thousands of tests, these tips and best practices will guide you to run tests faster and more reliably.

---

## 1. How can I reduce the overall run time of my large test suite?

**Answer:**
- Parallelize test execution by splitting tests across multiple CPU cores or machines.
- Organize tests to run the most critical or frequently failing ones first.
- Use selective test runs focused on changed code areas during development.
- Employ test sharding techniques available in your build or CI system.

**Example:**
If your suite contains 1000 tests that take 1000 seconds sequentially, running 8 parallel shards can reduce the total time close to 125 seconds, assuming tests are evenly distributed.

<Tip>
Configure your CI system to run tests concurrently (e.g., via bazel or CMakeâ€™s ctest parallel options).
</Tip>

---

## 2. What is test sharding and how do I manage it?

**Answer:**
Test sharding divides the test suite into parts (shards) that run independently and in parallel. Each shard runs a subset of tests, reducing wall-clock time.

**Managing test shards involves:**
- Declaring how tests are assigned to shards.
- Ensuring shards cover the full suite without overlap or omission.
- Collecting and aggregating results after parallel runs.

**User flow:**
1. Configure shard count in your test runner or CI.
2. Distribute test lists evenly.
3. Run shards in parallel.
4. Combine test results for the complete report.

<Tip>
For example, ctest supports `--slice` and `--schedule-random` to run shards.
</Tip>

---

## 3. How does test dependency management improve performance?

Tests sometimes depend on shared resources or need to run in a certain order. Managing these dependencies avoids redundant work and parallelism bottlenecks.

**Strategies include:**
- Marking tests with dependencies explicitly (e.g., via custom attributes).
- Running independent tests concurrently.
- Isolating slow or stateful tests.

**Practical tip:**
Use test fixtures carefully to manage shared state and avoid costly setup/teardown duplication.

---

## 4. Can I prioritize or disable slow or flaky tests during optimization?

Yes. Identify slow tests via profiling and assign them lower priority or mark them to run less frequently.

**Approaches:**
- Add labels or tags to tests (e.g., `[slow]`).
- Use command-line filters to exclude or include test subsets.
- Mark flaky tests to be retried or quarantined.

**Example:**
`./mytests --gtest_filter=-*.SlowTest` runs all except those marked slow.

<Tip>
Profile your tests regularly to monitor and address emerging bottlenecks.
</Tip>

---

## 5. How do I leverage CMake and build system support to speed up test execution?

GoogleTest integrates well with CMake and other build systems that provide test execution controls.

**Key points:**
- Use `ctest` parallelism (`ctest -j N`) to run multiple tests concurrently.
- Utilize build caching to skip rebuilding unchanged test targets.
- Use test dependencies and custom CTest scripts to orchestrate execution order.

<Tip>
Configure timeout and resource constraints properly to avoid false test failures during parallel runs.
</Tip>

---

## 6. How can I optimize resource usage when running tests?

Running multiple tests in parallel stresses CPU, memory, and I/O.

**Best practices:**
- Limit parallelism based on available resources.
- Avoid global shared state that causes contention.
- Use fixtures to share expensive setup across multiple tests.
- Optimize test data size and caching.

---

## 7. What are common pitfalls when optimizing test performance?

- Over-parallelization causing resource exhaustion and flaky tests.
- Over-restrictive dependencies serializing the suite unnecessarily.
- Over-specifying mock expectations impeding test speed and maintainability.
- Ignoring slow tests that degrade overall feedback cycles.

<Tip>
Balance speed and test reliability by incremental optimization and continuous profiling.
</Tip>

---

## 8. Are there configuration flags or environment variables to control performance?

Yes. GoogleTest supports various flags affecting test execution, such as:

- `--gtest_parallel` (CI system-dependent).
- `--gtest_filter` to run subsets.
- `--gtest_repeat` to rerun tests for stability.

Also, build and CI systems provide more controls for execution scheduling.

---

## 9. How do I monitor and profile test performance?

- Use built-in test timing reports (e.g., `--gtest_print_time`).
- Collect logs and resource usage metrics.
- Integrate with CI dashboards showing test durations.

Analyzing these helps identify candidates for optimization.

---

## 10. How do I handle flaky tests that impact suite performance?

- Isolate flaky tests and mark them separately.
- Use retries or quarantine mechanisms.
- Debug and improve flaky tests over time.

This reduces noise and accelerates stable test runs.

### Step-by-Step: Enabling Parallel Test Execution with CTest

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Configure Parallelism Parameter">
Make sure to pass the `-j` option to `ctest` to run tests in parallel. For example, use `ctest -j 8` to run tests on 8 cores.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Distribute Tests Across Shards (Optional)">
If your CI system supports sharding, configure it to split your tests into shards and run each separately.
