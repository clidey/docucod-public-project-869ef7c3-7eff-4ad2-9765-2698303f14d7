# Integration with Existing Projects

GoogleTest and GoogleMock integrate smoothly into established C++ codebases with diverse build systems like CMake and Bazel, as well as custom tooling. This guide focuses specifically on strategies and best practices for incorporating GoogleTest/GoogleMock into your existing project infrastructure, managing third-party library conflicts, and aligning with continuous integration (CI) pipelines to ensure reliable automated testing.

---

## 1. Choosing and Configuring Your Build System

Your first step is deciding how GoogleTest and GoogleMock fit into your chosen build system, whether it’s CMake, Bazel, or a custom solution. Correctly setting up the build ensures that your tests compile, link, and run without conflicts or unexpected errors.

### 1.1 CMake Integration

- **Add GoogleTest as an External Project or Submodule**: Pull GoogleTest into your repository or reference it externally.
- **Target Linking**: Link your test targets against `gtest` and `gmock` libraries as appropriate.
- **Include Directories**: Include the GoogleTest include paths in your test targets.
- **Example Setup**:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp my_tests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest gmock_main)
```

- **Modern CMake (3.10+)**: Use `FetchContent` to fetch GoogleTest and GoogleMock dynamically with recommended idioms.

### 1.2 Bazel Integration

- Use the official Bazel `@com_google_googletest` external repository.
- Define `cc_test` targets linking to `@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main` or `:gtest_main`.
- Pay attention to platform-specific toolchain configurations as detailed in the Bazel integration guides.

### 1.3 Custom and Legacy Build Systems

- Manually compile and link GoogleTest and GoogleMock source files.
- Ensure compiler flags align with GoogleTest’s requirements (C++17 and later).
- Explicitly manage include paths and link libraries.
- Consider wrapping GoogleTest integration into reusable makefiles or scripts for maintainability.

<Tip>
Proper linking of GoogleMock (`gmock`) and GoogleTest (`gtest`) components is essential: link `gmock_main` if you prefer GoogleTest's main() entry point, or provide your own `main()` function.
</Tip>

## 2. Preventing Conflicts with Third-Party Libraries

In many codebases, GoogleTest is one among many third-party dependencies. To ensure smooth coexistence:

- **Namespace Usage**: GoogleTest uses the `testing` namespace; avoid conflicts by qualifying or using explicit `using` declarations only in test files.
- **Macro Conflicts**: System headers or other libraries may define common macro names like `EXPECT_CALL` or `ASSERT_*`. Use header order tricks (including GoogleTest headers last), or use scoped macros carefully.
- **Defining Mock Methods in `public:` Sections**: Even if mocking private or protected virtual methods, place `MOCK_METHOD` macros in `public:` to prevent linkage issues and ensure visibility for the mocking framework.
- **Compiler Compatibility**: Confirm compiler flags align with GoogleTest’s C++17 requirement and platform support matrix to prevent runtime or compile-time failures.

<Warning>
Avoid mixing different versions of GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries in the same project to prevent symbol collisions and unpredictable behavior.
</Warning>

## 3. Coordinating with Continuous Integration Pipelines

Integration into CI pipelines is key to automated quality assurance. The following are best practices tailored for GoogleTest:

### 3.1 Running Tests in CI Environments

- **Automate Test Execution**: Include standardized test runs in build jobs with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` or equivalent.
- **Output Formats**: Use XML output (`--gtest_output=xml:<file>`) to produce machine-readable test reports.
- **Filtering and Selective Runs**: Use GoogleTest’s filtering flags (`--gtest_filter`) to run subsets of tests for faster feedback cycles.
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Use test sharding (`--test_shard_index` and `--test_total_shards`) to enable parallel test execution across CI agents.

### 3.2 Handling Test Dependencies and Environment Setup

- Ensure that required platform dependencies, environment variables, and mock configurations are reproducible on CI agents.
- Setup consistent compiler and build tool versions on CI, matching local development.

### 3.3 Reporting and Diagnostics

- Capture verbose logs with `--gmock_verbose=info` for debugging failures.
- Integrate test failure outputs with your CI dashboard for easy navigation to problematic test cases.
- Implement test timeouts and resource limits to prevent hangs or infrastructure overload.

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Mocking Basics**: Define mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros for interfaces to replace real dependencies.
- **Expectation Management**: Use `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expected calls, and `ON_CALL` for default behaviors without expectations.
- **Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks**: Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, `NaggyMock` (default) to warn, and `StrictMock` to fail immediately on unexpected calls to ensure test rigor.
- **Sequencing and Ordering**: Use `Sequence` and `InSequence` objects to enforce call ordering within your mocks.
- **Delegate to Fakes or Real Objects**: Use default action delegation to avoid duplicating logic and keep mocks maintainable.
- **Verify and Clear Expectations**: Explicitly call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if your mocks live beyond expected test lifetimes or unusual ownership patterns.

<Check>
Always place your `EXPECT_CALL` definitions before exercising the mock. Setting expectations after the fact leads to undefined behavior.
</Check>

## 5. Example User Workflow

### Step 1: Setup Build with CMake

```cmake
add_subdirectory(googletest)
add_executable(my_module_tests my_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_module_tests gtest gmock_main)
```

### Step 2: Define Mock Classes

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class FooInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~FooInterface() = default;
  virtual int GetValue() const = 0;
  virtual void DoAction(int x) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public FooInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoAction, (int x), (override));
};
```

### Step 3: Write Tests with Expectations

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

TEST(FooTest, ReturnsCorrectValue) {
  MockFoo mock_foo;
  ON_CALL(mock_foo, GetValue()).WillByDefault(Return(42));

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoAction(_));

  // Your test exercising system that uses mock_foo
}
```

### Step 4: Integrate into CI

- Run `my_module_tests --gtest_output=xml:result.xml`
- Publish XML report for CI dashboard visualization
- Use filtering and sharding as needed

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Missing Symbols or Linking Errors

- Verify correct linking against `gtest` and `gmock` libraries.
- Ensure the mock class destructor is virtual to avoid leaks and runtime errors.
- Check for multiple GoogleTest versions in your dependency graph.

### Problem: Unexpected Mock Call Warnings

- Confirm that you set up `EXPECT_CALL` for all expected interactions.
- Use `NiceMock` if certain methods are called but not under test scrutiny.

### Problem: Test Failures Related to Ordering or Call Counts

- Use `Sequence` or `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to express call ordering and avoid sticky expectations.
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed tracing of mock calls.

### Problem: Conflicts with Other Libraries or System Headers

- Isolate GoogleTest headers from system headers causing macro collisions.
- Use explicit namespace qualifications to avoid symbol conflicts.
