## 1. Getting Help and Support

When you encounter problems or have questions about GoogleTest or GoogleMock, these resources will help you find answers quickly and efficiently.

### Official Support Channels

- **Issue Tracker:** Report bugs, request features, or track known issues on the GitHub repository's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues). Always search for existing issues before opening new ones.

- **Mailing Lists:** GoogleTest does not have public official mailing lists, but you can often find help via development community forums or relevant C++ testing forums.

- **Stack Overflow:** Ask questions using the `googletest` or `googlemock` tags. Many users and developers participate here.

### Documentation and FAQs

- Start with the [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) for foundational understanding.
- Consult the [API Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/) for detailed explanations.
- Visit FAQ sections on [Getting Started](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/getting-started-faq/), [Mocking Basics](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/mocking-faq/mocking-basics-faq/), and [Integration Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/integration-performance-faq/build-system-integration/).

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Enable verbose output for mocks using `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls and expectations.
- Verify that your environment meets the mandatory [C++17 standard requirement](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/getting-started-faq/language-compatibility-support/).
- Use the diagnostic flags and logging utilities documented in the [Platform and Portability APIs](https://google.github.io/googletest/api_reference/configuration_and_main_api/platform_and_portability_apis.html).
- Review the [Common Setup Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/getting-started-faq/installation-build-issues/) FAQ for build and installation problems.

<Tip>
If you face unexpected mock failures, consult the [Mocking Troubleshooting FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/mocking-faq/troubleshooting-mock-failures/) for guidance.

## 4. How GoogleMock Supports Your Testing Workflow

As a part of GoogleTest, GoogleMock offers powerful mocking capabilities. Most users find the following documents useful alongside this page:

- [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html): Practical recipes for mocking techniques.
- [gMock Cheat Sheet](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cheat_sheet.html): Handy reference for macros and patterns.
- [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/gmock-legacy-faq.html): For troubleshooting older gMock scenarios.

Understanding the various strictness modes such as `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` will help manage uninteresting calls, as detailed in the [Nice, Strict and Naggy](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#NiceStrictNaggy) documentation.
