# Test Suite Performance & Scalability FAQ

GoogleTest, including its mocking framework gMock, is designed to handle test suites ranging from small isolated tests to large and complex collections efficiently. This page focuses on practical methods and strategies to accelerate test execution, manage resources wisely, and keep your developer workflows smooth, especially as your suite grows in size and complexity.

---

## 1. How can I speed up my test suite execution?

### Parallel Test Execution
GoogleTest natively supports running tests in parallel by splitting the workload across multiple processes. This can dramatically reduce test times on multi-core machines.

- **Run Tests in Parallel:** Use the `--jobs=N` flag when running tests to execute tests in `N` parallel jobs. For example:

  ```bash
  ./my_test --jobs=8
  ```

- **Shard Tests:** Use `--gtest_shard_count` and `--gtest_shard_index` flags to split tests into shards, distributing them across multiple machines or processes.

### Test Filtering
Focus test runs on relevant subsets:

- Use `--gtest_filter` to run only a specific subset of tests to save time during development.

### Avoiding Expensive Setup
- Use test fixtures efficiently to ensure only necessary setup is done.
- Avoid global/static state that might carry over and slow down tests unintentionally.

---

## 2. How do I reduce resource consumption during tests?

- **Minimize External Dependencies:** Mock external services and resources instead of using real instances.
- **Use Lightweight Mocks:** gMock is efficient and allows precise mocking; don’t mock more than necessary.
- **Reuse Mock Objects:** Create mock objects once and reuse them for multiple tests when state resets safely.
- **Limit Heavy Initialization:** Defer expensive initialization to only when needed.

---

## 3. What strategies help manage very large or complex test suites?

### Organize Tests Logically
- Divide tests into logical groups or directories.
- Use test suites and parameterized tests to reduce duplication.

### Use Selective Test Runs
- Run slow or integration tests less frequently.
- Mark tests with `[DISABLED_]` or custom labels to exclude them from routine runs.

### Use Test Fixtures and Helpers
- Write helper functions and test fixtures to abstract common logic.

### Continuous Integration Optimization
- Spread tests across multiple CI jobs using shards or parallel execution.
- Cache dependencies and build artifacts to shorten build times.

---

## 4. How can I optimize the use of GoogleMock to avoid slowing down tests?

### Use ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL Wisely
- **ON_CALL:** Establish default mock behavior without setting expectations—faster and less brittle.
- **EXPECT_CALL:** Use only when you _need_ to verify calls. Excessive expectations can slow tests.

### Minimize Matchers Complexity
- Use simple and efficient matchers whenever possible.
- Avoid overly complex matchers that slow down argument matching.

### Avoid Over-Mocking
- Do not mock everything needlessly - overuse can increase overhead.

### Control Mock Verbosity
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning`, `error`) to control logging noise that can impact performance.

---

## 5. What are some common pitfalls that cause slow test suites?

- **Interleaving Setup and Tests:** Setting expectations or mocks after the code under test is invoked can cause unexpected delays.
- **Excessive Global or Static Data:** Leads to high memory consumption and slower startup times.
- **Ignoring Test Isolation:** Tests sharing state or resources can cause timing issues and performance degradation.
- **Heavy Use of Sequences and Complex Ordering:** Overusing call order constraints in gMock can add overhead.

---

## 6. How do I monitor and profile my test suite's performance?

- Instrument your tests by measuring execution times of test cases.
- Use GoogleTest’s `--gtest_break_on_failure` and verbosity flags to diagnose slow tests.
- Profile the test binary using system profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

---

## 7. How do I handle flaky or slow tests in large suites?

- Isolate and mark flaky tests separately.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` or disable flakey tests temporarily to keep the main suite stable.
- Address root causes with better mocks or improved test design.

---

## 8. How to Extend or Customize Test Execution for Scalability?

- Write custom test event listeners to collect metrics.
- Integrate test results with CI dashboards to visualize test duration trends.
- Employ incremental testing strategies - run tests affected by code changes.

<Tip>
For major speed improvements, prioritize parallel test execution and efficient mocking strategies. Avoid overly strict expectations and aim for clean modular test design.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Be cautious with complex sequences or ordering constraints in mocks, as these can significantly degrade test scalability.
</Warning>

<Note>
Balancing thoroughness and speed is key. Focus on meaningful tests and maintain fast feedback loops.

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Parallelism                   | Use `--jobs` or sharding for concurrent runs        |
| Mock Setup                   | Use `ON_CALL` for defaults; restrict `EXPECT_CALL` |
| Test Selection              | Use `--gtest_filter` to isolate tests                 |
| Resource Management         | Use mocks over real services; reuse mock objects      |
| Avoid Over-Specification    | Limit overly strict mock matching                      |
| Profile & Monitor           | Measure test durations, use system profilers          |

### Example: Running Tests in Parallel

```bash
# Run all tests in 4 parallel jobs
./my_test --jobs=4

# Run the first shard of tests out of 4
./my_test --gtest_shard_index=0 --gtest_shard_count=4
```

---

### Common Command-Line Flags for Performance

- `--jobs=N`: Run tests with N parallel jobs.
- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`: Run a subset of tests.
- `--gmock_verbose=LEVEL`: Set gMock logging level to control output overhead.
- `--gtest_shard_count=N`, `--gtest_shard_index=M`: Split test execution across shards.
