# Platform and Compiler Support FAQ

This FAQ page clarifies the supported platforms, compiler versions, and C++ standard compatibility for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It will help you understand which environments work seamlessly with the framework, how to handle cross-platform issues, and what compiler standards you need. Whether you are setting up for Linux, Windows, or macOS, this guide answers frequent questions related to portability and compatibility.

---

## 1. Which platforms does GoogleTest support?

GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms, ensuring you can write and run tests consistently across your development environments. These include:

- **Linux:** Various distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.
- **Windows:** Desktop variants, including MSVC-built environments and MinGW.
- **macOS:** Including Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.
- **Other Unix-like systems:** Such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and AIX.

For embedded or less-common platforms (e.g., Android, Native Client, QNX), GoogleTest can sometimes be built and used but may require additional configuration or tweaks.

<Tip>
Being aware of your target platform's support helps avoid unexpected issues during test compilation or execution. If your platform falls outside this list, consult the community or look for custom porting instructions.
</Tip>

## 2. What are the minimum compiler requirements?

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler with C++17 support as a baseline. Specifically:

- **GCC:** Version 7 or higher is recommended to ensure full C++17 compatibility.
- **Clang:** Version 5 or higher.
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.3) or later.

Compilers older than these may fail to build GoogleTest or GoogleMock due to missing features.

<Note>
While GoogleTest requires C++17, you should explicitly set your compiler flags, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or `/std:c++17` for MSVC to avoid compatibility issues.
</Note>

## 3. Is GoogleTest compatible with all C++ standards?

No. GoogleTest requires an environment that supports **at least C++17**. Attempts to build with older standards like C++11 or C++14 will result in compilation errors.

To guarantee correct integration:

- Set your build system or compiler flags to C++17 or higher. For example:
  - In CMake: `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`
  - In command line: `-std=c++17`

- Ensure dependencies and third-party libraries in your project are also compatible with C++17.

## 4. How does GoogleTest detect the operating system and platform at compile time?

GoogleTest uses a combination of compiler predefined macros to detect the underlying platform. These macros categorically identify environments such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and many Unix variants.

For example:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` macro is defined for Windows platforms, including subtypes like MinGW.
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX` is defined for Linux-based systems.
- `GTEST_OS_MAC` for macOS, with `GTEST_OS_IOS` for iOS.

This automatic detection helps GoogleTest enable platform-specific code paths and workarounds transparently.

<Info>
If you encounter issues where GoogleTest misdetects your platform, consider manually overriding detection macros in your build configuration, though this is rarely necessary.
</Info>

## 5. Does GoogleTest support building and running on embedded systems?

Although GoogleTest primarily targets desktop and server-class platforms, it can be adapted to embedded systems with limitations.

Supported embedded platforms include some:

- **Android:** Limited full support; requires NDK with C++17 support.
- **ARM-based boards:** Possible with proper toolchain and environment setup.

However, embedded platforms often lack full POSIX or system support expected by GoogleTest, such as filesystem access, exceptions, or thread local storage, which can limit the range of features.

<Warning>
Testing on embedded platforms may require disabling some features or modifying GoogleTest source. It's recommended to test early and refer to community discussions for best practices.
</Warning>

## 6. Are there any known limitations specific to Windows?

Yes. When working on Windows platforms, consider these points:

- The minimum supported MSVC compiler is Visual Studio 2015 for GoogleMock and Visual Studio 2017 for GoogleTest.
- Dynamic vs. static runtime linkage needs careful setup to avoid linker errors, controlled by the CMake flag `gtest_force_shared_crt`.
- Microsoft’s Structured Exception Handling (SEH) is supported, but certain platform variants like Windows Mobile may lack full API support.
- The path separator differences (`\` vs `/`) and Unicode file path handling are automatically managed internally but can affect custom extensions.

<Tip>
Review the CMake build instructions and configure options specifically for Windows to avoid common build issues.
</Tip>

## 7. How does GoogleTest handle multithreading support across platforms?

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where multithreading primitives are available:

- Posix threads (pthread) on Unix-like systems.
- Windows threading APIs on Windows.

If GoogleTest detects pthread support (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`), multithreaded tests and assertions execute correctly.

If threading support is not detected, GoogleTest will compile but disable thread safety, which can result in undefined behavior in multi-threaded test scenarios.

<Note>
If GoogleTest fails to detect pthread support correctly, you can manually define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` to force the behavior.
</Note>

## 8. Can I use GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL)?

Yes. While most users link GoogleTest statically, building GoogleTest as a shared library is supported.

To build GoogleTest as a shared library:

- Add `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to compiler flags.
- Add `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to tests compiling against the shared library.

Make sure to configure your linker correctly for shared library generation in your environment.

<Warning>
Building GoogleTest as a shared library is more complex and typically unnecessary for small or simple projects. Ensure proper flag setup to avoid runtime incompatibilities.
</Warning>

## 9. How do I avoid macro name clashes with GoogleTest?

GoogleTest defines many macros (e.g., `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`) without namespace scoping. To prevent conflicts with other libraries:

- Use compiler flags like `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` to rename GoogleTest macros by prefixing `GTEST_`. For example, use `GTEST_TEST` instead of `TEST`.

- This avoids clashes if your project or dependencies define macros with the same names.

<Info>
This renaming is optional, but highly recommended when integrating GoogleTest alongside other testing or utility libraries that may define overlapping macro names.
</Info>

## 10. Where can I find detailed information on supported platforms and integration?

## Troubleshooting Platform and Compiler Issues

### Problem: Compilation fails due to unsupported compiler version

- **Cause:** Compiler older than C++17 support.
- **Solution:** Upgrade your compiler to a version supporting at least C++17.
- **Verification:** Check compiler version with `gcc --version` or `clang --version`. Ensure build command uses `-std=c++17` or newer.

### Problem: Linker error on Windows regarding runtime libraries

- **Cause:** Mismatch between GoogleTest and project runtime linkage (static vs dynamic CRT).
- **Solution:** Use `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` with CMake or align both your project and GoogleTest to the same runtime library choice.

### Problem: Tests behave unexpectedly on non-desktop platforms

- **Cause:** Missing POSIX features or file system support.
- **Solution:** Adjust build flags to disable unsupported features or consider stub implementations. Review `[Embedded Platform Support](https://google.github.io/googletest/overview/integrations-and-ecosystem/platform-support-and-build-integration#embedded-platforms)`.

<Check>
For detailed troubleshooting, always enable verbose build logs and review the detected macros in GoogleTest’s output to confirm platform detection.
</Check>
