# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

This page provides a concise summary of the platforms, operating systems, and C++ compilers officially supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including key compatibility notes, C++ language standard requirements, and guidance on staying current with support changes. Understanding this helps avoid environment mismatches that could otherwise lead to wasted time during onboarding or build failures.

## Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed for broad cross-platform use and officially support the following operating systems:

- **Windows:** Including Desktop editions and MinGW environments.
- **Linux:** Various distributions including mainstream kernels and flavors.
- **macOS:** Desktop and server versions.
- **UNIX variants:** Such as AIX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, HPUX, QNX, and DragonFlyBSD.
- **Google Native Client (NaCl) and Fuchsia:** Supported as niche platforms.
- **Embedded Platforms:** Select embedded platforms are supported, including ESP8266, ESP32, Xtensa, QURT, and specific microcontroller targets like NXP QN9090 and NRF52.

GoogleTest detects these platforms via compile-time macros automatically to enable platform-specific features and workarounds.

## Supported C++ Compilers and Language Standards

### Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17-compliant compiler. This mandatory requirement ensures compatibility with language features and standard library components utilized throughout the framework.

Supported compilers include:

- **MS Visual C++:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (_MSC_VER >= 1911_) or newer. Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is the minimal supported version, but updating to VS 2017+ is strongly recommended.
  - For MSVC, GoogleMock reports a compile-time error if using an unsupported older compiler (_MSC_VER < 1900_).
- **GCC:** Versions supporting C++17. GCC 7.0 and above are fully compatible with relevant flag options.
- **Clang:** Versions supporting C++17, including LLVM and Apple Clang flavors.
- **Intel LLVM Compiler:** Supported when compliant with C++17.
- **SunPro, VisualAge (XL), HP:** Support is available but with additional configuration for exceptions and RTTI.

### C++17 Language Standard

- GoogleTest explicitly mandates the use of the **C++17 standard** or newer.
- The `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` option is set to **17** in provided CMake build scripts to ensure compliance.
- Users integrating GoogleTest into other projects must set their build environments accordingly (e.g., `-std=c++17` or `/std:c++17`).

### Exceptions and RTTI

- Exception handling and RTTI must be enabled for full framework functionality, especially for tests that rely on these features.
- GoogleTest includes macros and checks that detect and enforce proper exception and RTTI support.

---

## Threading and Synchronization Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms where POSIX threads (`pthread`) or Windows threading APIs are available.
- Support for `pthread` is automatically detected on most UNIX-like systems except certain embedded targets and Windows Mobile environments.
- On Windows, native synchronization primitives are used.
- Users can force enable or disable threading support via macros (e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `=0`).

---

## Build and Integration Support

- The repository includes CMake build scripts that automatically tune compiler flags and detect platform capabilities.
- CMake macros ensure consistent flags such as disabling dynamic runtimes or enabling recommended warning levels.
- For Windows and MSVC, special flags ensure UTF-8 encoding and appropriate exception handling.
- The build system configures threading support and links pthread libraries if available.
- Shared library (DLL) builds are supported with dedicated compiler definitions such as `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY` and `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY`.

---

## Staying Up-to-Date on Supported Platforms and Compilers

- Regularly consult the [Supported Platforms & Requirements documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/overview/adoption-and-integration/supported-platforms-and-requirements.mdx) for updates.
- Keep GoogleTest and GoogleMock up to date to benefit from improvements, bug fixes, and expanded platform support.
- Review release notes for breaking changes related to compiler requirements and platform compatibility.
- Monitor platform-specific macros and build flags that may require adjustments in your build environment.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Ensure your toolchain supports C++17.** Running the test builds on older compilers or with incompatible flags will lead to errors and undefined behavior.
- **Match runtime library linkage.** For example, in Visual Studio, link runtimes consistently between GoogleTest and your projects using the `gtest_force_shared_crt` flag.
- **Check threading support.** If running on an unusual or embedded platform, verify whether threading support is enabled or disabled and adjust your build flags accordingly.

<Tip>
If you encounter build or runtime issues related to platform or compiler support, consulting the troubleshooting FAQ and ensuring that your development environment meets these platform compatibility guidelines will save considerable debugging time.
