# Are there platform or compiler limitations?

This page provides a clear overview of the platforms and compilers supported by GoogleTest, outlines common compatibility challenges, and offers practical guidance on how to diagnose and resolve version or environment-related issues. By understanding the supported environments and version requirements, you can ensure smooth integration and reliable test execution.

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest is designed as a cross-platform C++ testing framework, with explicit support for a wide range of operating systems and compilers. It adheres to the [Google Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring your tests run reliably across supported environments.

### Platforms

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform at compile time and configures itself accordingly. Supported platforms include but are not limited to:

- Linux (including Android variants)
- Windows Desktop (including MinGW and variants)
- Mac OS X and iOS
- UNIX-like platforms such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris
- Various embedded systems (e.g., ESP32, ESP8266)

This detection is implemented internally (see `gtest-port-arch.h`) via predefined macros that identify operating systems such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and others.

### Compilers

GoogleTest requires a C++17 compliant compiler:

- GCC 7.0 or later
- Clang 3.4 or later
- MSVC 2017 (19.11) or later

Older versions and non-compliant compilers will not build GoogleTest successfully. For Microsoft Visual C++ specifically, versions prior to 2015 will cause compilation errors.

### C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest mandates that your compilation environment supports the C++17 standard or higher. This ensures usage of modern language features for better performance, safer code, and maintainability.

You can specify this in CMake via:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

or by passing appropriate flags manually to your compiler.

## Diagnosing Compatibility Issues

When GoogleTest fails to build or behaves unexpectedly, platform or compiler incompatibilities are often the root cause. Here’s how to identify and overcome these:

### Common Symptoms

- Compilation errors referencing unsupported language features or missing headers.
- Linker errors due to missing symbols, potentially caused by mismatched runtime libraries.
- Runtime crashes or misbehavior on unsupported or partially supported platforms.
- Macro redefinition conflicts caused by incompatible compiler versions or settings.

### Step-by-Step Diagnosis

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Compiler Version and C++ Standard">
Run your compiler with `--version` or an equivalent to confirm the installed version.
Check the compilation flags to ensure C++17 or later is enabled.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Platform Macros">
Confirm GoogleTest detects the right platform by inspecting build logs or symbol definitions for macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` or `GTEST_OS_LINUX`.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Threading Support">
GoogleTest’s thread safety depends on platform features like pthreads. Verify if pthread is available and correctly linked.
If missing, adjust flags with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` or `1` accordingly.
</Step>
<Step title="Look for Exception and RTTI Settings">
GoogleTest requires exceptions and RTTI enabled. Make sure your compiler options do not disable `-fno-exceptions` or `-fno-rtti`.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Runtime Library Consistency (Windows)">
On MSVC, mismatch between dynamic and static CRT libraries will cause linker errors.
Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align runtime settings.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Addressing Version and Environment Requirements

### C++ Version Enforcement

GoogleTest explicitly checks for C++17 or newer and will refuse to compile if the environment does not meet this standard:

```c++
#if !defined(GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG) || \
    GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG < 201703L
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
#endif
```

Set your project or build system to meet this prerequisite upfront.

### Multi-threading and Pthread Support

GoogleTest detects pthread availability to enable thread-safe tests. Some MinGW environments or embedded platforms may lack full support.
If your environment lacks pthread support, disable threading explicitly with:

```
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

otherwise enable it with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` and link pthreads:

```bash
g++ -pthread ...
```

### Windows-Specific Considerations

- Visual Studio 2015 or later is required.
- Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if you want to link GoogleTest's runtime dynamically to avoid CRT mismatches.
- Wide string handling is supported and configured automatically.

### Shared Library Usage

You can build GoogleTest as a shared library by defining:

```
-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

and compile tests with:

```
-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

This requires passing appropriate flags for DLL generation and linking in your environment.

## Practical Tips and Troubleshooting

- **Always confirm your build environment matches GoogleTest’s system requirements before integration.**
- **Use pkg-config or CMake’s `find_package(GTest)` to simplify compiler and linker flag management.**
- **Check the generated build output or logs for detected platform and macros to ensure proper configuration.**
- **Overrides and customization macros (found in `custom/gtest-port.h`) enable tweaking platform detection or feature availability if necessary.**
- **When cross-compiling, adjust `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` and related environment variables to ensure proper sysroot paths in build flags.**
- **Consult GoogleTest’s `gtest-port.h` and `gtest-port-arch.h` headers for internal macro details on platform detection and feature support.**
