# Integration & Build Troubleshooting FAQ

This page offers step-by-step solutions to common build system integration problems with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, focusing on CMake and Bazel configurations, resolving misconfiguration-related test failures, and linking tips for GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries. The goal is to empower you to efficiently integrate these testing frameworks into your build environment and confidently address the typical issues encountered.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why does my project fail to find GoogleTest or GoogleMock headers during build?
- **Cause:** Your build system may not have the correct include paths configured to point to the GoogleTest/GoogleMock source directories or installed locations.
- **Solution:** Ensure your CMake or Bazel setup includes the proper include directory entries. For CMake, include directories typically point to `${googletest_SOURCE_DIR}/include` or the installation prefix include path. For Bazel, verify workspace and build files declare dependencies to `@com_google_googletest` or equivalent.

#### How do I correctly link GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries in CMake?
- **Cause:** Linker errors often happen because test binaries do not link against these libraries or do so incorrectly.
- **Solution:** Use the libraries provided by GoogleTest/Bazel:
```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_test PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main)
```
For GoogleMock, also link `gmock` and `gmock_main` libraries:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_test PRIVATE gmock gmock_main)
```
Verify that `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` is linked if you rely on the default provided `main()` function.

#### My Bazel build fails with missing dependencies errors related to GoogleTest?
- **Cause:** Bazel BUILD files might be missing `deps` entries for GoogleTest/GoogleMock targets.
- **Solution:** Ensure your `bazel` target `deps` include the GoogleTest targets such as `@com_google_googletest//:gtest` or `@com_google_googletest//:gmock`. Consult the FetchContent or Bazel repository setup instructions for correct external dependencies configuration.

#### Tests compile but fail to run or discover tests properly?
- **Cause:** Several causes, including improper linking against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`, misnaming of test suites/tests, or incorrect initialization.
- **Solution:** Make sure your test binary links the main function from `gtest_main` or implement your own `main()` calling `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS();`. Review test naming conventions: test suites and names should not have underscores.

#### How can I resolve 'Uninteresting mock function call' warnings?
- **Cause:** Mock methods are called without corresponding `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- **Solution:** Add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly allow these calls, or instantiate mocks as `NiceMock` to suppress warnings. Avoid suppressing warnings by adding empty `EXPECT_CALL`s as it degrades test quality.

#### Linker errors: undefined references to GoogleMock symbols when linking tests?
- **Cause:** Forgetting to link against `gmock` and/or `gmock_main` libraries.
- **Solution:** Add linkage to both `gmock` and `gmock_main` alongside `gtest` libraries. Check for consistent build configurations when linking.

#### How to troubleshoot test build failures in CMake with FetchContent?
- **Cause:** Misconfigurations in `FetchContent_Declare` or improper `target_link_libraries` usage.
- **Solution:** Follow recommended usage to download GoogleTest inside `CMakeLists.txt` and link your test targets against the imported targets:
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.12.1.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)
...
target_link_libraries(your_test PRIVATE gtest gtest_main)
```

#### Why am I getting multiple definition errors or clashes when linking my tests?
- **Cause:** Linking both `gtest_main` and user-defined `main()` function or mixing different GoogleTest versions.
- **Solution:** Use exactly one `main()` entry point. Either link `gtest_main` (or `gmock_main`) or provide your own `main()` but not both. Confirm all linked libraries belong to the same GoogleTest version to avoid ABI conflicts.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Verify your include and library paths:** Incorrect paths are the most common root of build problems.
- **Check build system output carefully:** CMake or Bazel error messages often hint at missing dependencies or files.
- **Run a minimal test:** Create a minimal test with only one simple `TEST()` to verify your integration.
- **Use provided examples:** Start by successfully building and running the examples in the GoogleTest repository.
- **Enable verbose output:** For Bazel, `--verbose_failures`; for CMake, increase verbosity with `--trace` or `make VERBOSE=1`.

### Linking GoogleTest and GoogleMock in Practice

For best results, follow these integration tips:

- Use the `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries to automatically get the test executable's main() function.
- When embedding GoogleTest into a larger project, prefer `FetchContent` or imported targets to vendor your test framework.
- If building GoogleTest/GoogleMock from source, use the recommended CMake usage for building `gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, and `gmock_main` targets.
- Link only needed libraries: for mock support, link `gmock` and `gmock_main`;
  for pure unit tests, `gtest` and `gtest_main` are sufficient.
- Ensure ordering in `target_link_libraries` respects dependencies.

### Real Scenario Example: CMake Integration

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTests CXX)

# Enable FetchContent to bring in GoogleTest.
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.12.1.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_test my_test.cc)

target_link_libraries(my_test PRIVATE gtest gtest_main)

# Enable C++17 standard.
target_compile_features(my_test PRIVATE cxx_std_17)
```

Build with:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./my_test
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Forgetting to call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` if you provide a custom `main()`.
- Naming test suites or tests with underscores, which breaks test discovery filtering; GoogleTest recommends no underscores in test suite and test names.
- Setting conflicting or missing compiler flags across GoogleTest and your project (e.g., C++ standard version).
- Linking GoogleTest or GoogleMock statically but missing definitions or mixing static and dynamic linkage.
- Over-specifying `EXPECT_CALL` for uninteresting calls, which leads to brittle tests.
