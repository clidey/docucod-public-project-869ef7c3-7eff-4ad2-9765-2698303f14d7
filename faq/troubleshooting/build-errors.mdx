# Why am I seeing build errors when compiling GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is a mature C++ testing framework designed to be portable and easy to integrate across multiple platforms and build systems. However, during the compilation and integration phase, users may encounter various build errors. These errors often stem from mismatched C++ standard versions, missing system dependencies, incorrect include paths, or linker issues.

This page addresses the most common compilation and integration errors encountered when building GoogleTest, providing actionable diagnostics, explanations, and guidance to resolve them efficiently.

## Common Causes of Build Errors

When building GoogleTest, users typically face build errors due to one or more of the following reasons:

### 1. Incompatible or Insufficient C++ Standard Version

- GoogleTest requires **C++17** or later. Attempting to build with older C++ standards (e.g., C++11 or C++14) will cause compilation failures.
- Your build system or compiler flags must explicitly enable at least C++17 support.

### 2. Missing or Incorrect Include Paths

- GoogleTest headers and source files must be correctly located and referenced in your build configuration.
- Common mistakes include not setting the include directories for the `googletest/include` path or failing to link against the compiled GoogleTest libraries.

### 3. Undefined or Missing Symbols/Linkage Errors

- These often occur if:
  - The GoogleTest library is not linked correctly.
  - Mixed linking of static and shared libraries or debug and release runtimes.
  - Visual Studio projects have mismatched CRT linkage settings.

### 4. Platform or Compiler Specific Issues

- Some errors may be specific to certain operating systems or compilers due to differences in standard library implementations or threading support.
- For example, missing pthread linkage on Linux or incompatible Visual Studio runtime settings on Windows.

## Diagnosing Build Errors

### Check Your Compiler Version and Flags

Ensure your compiler supports and is configured to use C++17 or later.

- For **GCC**, version 7.3 or above is required.
- For **Clang**, version 5.0 or above is required.
- For **MSVC**, Visual Studio 2017 or later is necessary.

Add or verify the flag to enable C++17, for example:

```bash
# For GCC and Clang:
-std=c++17

# For MSVC (Visual Studio):
/std:c++17
```

### Verify Include Paths

Verify that the compiler has access to GoogleTest headers:

- The include directory is typically `googletest/include`.
- If you installed GoogleTest system-wide, your build system should find this automatically.
- If building from source with CMake's out-of-source build, ensure you specify the correct paths.

Example CMake snippet:

```cmake
include_directories(${GTEST_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
link_directories(${GTEST_BINARY_DIR})
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest gtest_main)
```

### Verify Linking Settings

- GoogleTest provides two main libraries, `gtest` and `gtest_main`. The latter contains a default `main()` function.
- You must link your test executable with these, or provide your own `main()`.
- Mixed static and dynamic runtime linkage can cause linker errors especially on Windows Visual Studio.

For Visual Studio, ensure consistent runtime selection for GoogleTest and your tests:

- Use the same CRT linkage (e.g., both static debug `/MTd` or both dynamic debug `/MDd`).
- If using CMake, configure with:

```bash
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="/MTd"   # or /MDd, matching your project
```

### Missing pthread on POSIX Platforms

Some Linux builds report undefined references to pthread functions during linking.

- GoogleTest depends on pthread for thread-safety.
- Ensure your linker flags include `-pthread` or `-lpthread`.

Example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -o my_test my_test.o -lgtest -lgtest_main
```

### Check Build System Integration

If you build GoogleTest alongside your project using CMake subdirectory or FetchContent, avoid conflicting compiler or linker options.

- Prefer building GoogleTest with the same compiler and flags as your project.
- Use CMake's `FetchContent` or `add_subdirectory()` to keep configurations consistent.

## Actionable Steps to Resolve Build Errors

<Steps>
<Step title="Ensure or Upgrade Compiler">
Check your compiler version and upgrade if necessary. Enable C++17 support explicitly in your build system.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Include and Linker Settings">
Verify GoogleTest include directories and linked libraries in your build configuration.
</Step>
<Step title="Align Runtime and Build Settings">
For Visual Studio users, confirm that runtime libraries match (e.g., static or dynamic CRT across all modules).
</Step>
<Step title="Add Threading Support Flags">
On POSIX systems, add `-pthread` to both compile and link steps to ensure pthread support.
</Step>
<Step title="Use CMake Best Practices">
If using CMake, utilize GoogleTestâ€™s provided targets (`GTest::gtest`, `GTest::gtest_main`) and modern CMake integration patterns.
</Step>
<Step title="Consult Platform-Specific Guidance">
Refer to platform-specific documentation or related troubleshooting pages for OS or compiler peculiarities.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Platform-Specific Notes and Resources

### Linux and macOS

- Ensure GNU make or appropriate build tool is correctly installed.
- Use `-pthread` compiler and linker flags.
- Prefer building GoogleTest with CMake 3.14 or later.

### Windows (Visual Studio)

- Match runtime libraries (use `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if needed).
- Link `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries.
- If building manually, ensure all dependencies are available and included.

### Cross-Platform

- GoogleTest requires a C++17 environment.
- If using other build systems like Bazel, ensure correct dependency declarations are in place.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
If build errors persist, enable verbose build output to inspect compiler and linker commands. Look for missing paths or incompatible flags.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Try building GoogleTest standalone first to isolate build environment problems.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Refer to the official GoogleTest repository and community forums for platform-specific issues.
</Tip>
