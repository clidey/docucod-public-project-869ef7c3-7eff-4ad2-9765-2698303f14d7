# Diagnosing and Resolving Test Failures

This guide helps you investigate unexpected test failures that occur when using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It walks you through understanding error messages, identifying causes of test flakiness or indeterminacy, and applying systematic steps to find and fix issues, ultimately improving test reliability.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Failures and Their Causes

When a test fails unexpectedly, it may indicate a problem with the test or the code under test. Common causes include:

- **Incorrect or incomplete expectations:** Your mock expectations might not match how the code calls the mocks.
- **Order violations:** Expected calls may occur out of order if sequences or partial ordering aren't specified.
- **Argument mismatches:** Inputs passed to mock methods differ from expected values.
- **Uninteresting or unexpected calls:** Calls that your test does not expect or did not declare.
- **Resource leaks and lifecycle errors:** Mock objects not properly destroyed or verified.
- **Concurrency issues:** Race conditions or thread timing affecting test behavior.
- **Flaky tests and timing dependencies:** Tests that sometimes fail due to non-deterministic conditions.

<br/>

## 2. Interpreting Common GoogleMock Error Messages

GoogleMock provides descriptive error messages that give valuable clues:

- **Actual function call count doesn't match expectation:** The number of times a mock method was called differs from what you specified with `Times()`.

- **Unexpected mock function call:** A mock method was called with arguments or at times not covered by any `EXPECT_CALL`.

- **Too many / too few actions specified:** The number of `WillOnce()` actions doesn't match the expected call count.

- **Uninteresting mock function call:** A method was called that has no `EXPECT_CALL`; this is a warning about possible unintended calls.

- **Order violations:** Errors mentioning expectations not satisfied due to call order, possibly related to sequences or `.After()` clauses.

- **Retired expectation:** Indicates an expectation was no longer active, possibly due to satisfied prerequisites or upper-bound saturation.

- **Failure messages showing detailed argument mismatches:** GoogleMock prints expected vs actual argument values to help pin down the exact cause.

<br/>

## 3. Systematic Troubleshooting Workflow

Follow this step-by-step approach to diagnose and resolve failures:

<Steps>
<Step title="Run tests with increased verbosity">
Set the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed traces of mock method calls, expectation matches, and warnings. This will include which expectations are matched or missed.
</Step>
<Step title="Check your mock expectations and ON_CALL setups">
Ensure that all expected mock calls are declared before exercising the code. Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only to specify calls you want to verify.
</Step>
<Step title="Pay attention to call order constraints">
If the order of calls matters, use sequences (`InSequence`) or `.After()` with `EXPECT_CALL` to specify partial or total ordering. Violations produce clear error messages.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate argument matchers">
Verify that argument matchers (`_`, `Eq()`, custom matchers) correctly represent valid input ranges. Incorrect matchers often cause unexpected call failures.
</Step>
<Step title="Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations meant to be matched limited times">
For multiple discrete calls, chains of `EXPECT_CALL(...).WillOnce(...).RetiresOnSaturation()` help avoid 'sticky' expectations causing earlier ones to block later calls.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify mock object lifecycles">
Ensure mocks are properly destructed after use so GoogleMock can verify expectations. Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` explicitly if mocks live longer or are managed elsewhere.
</Step>
<Step title="Isolate flaky or timing-dependent tests">
Run suspect tests repeatedly with `--gtest_repeat` or in isolation. Look for timing-dependent failures or concurrency bugs.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for uninteresting or unexpected calls">
Suppress warnings on harmless uninteresting calls with `NiceMock`, or explicitly expect unexpected calls with `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to clarify intent.
</Step>
<Step title="Review custom actions and side effects carefully">
Ensure actions like `DoAll()`, lambdas, or `Invoke()` don't produce unintended side effects or resource releases that may cause test instability.
</Step>
</Steps>

<br/>

## 4. Best Practices to Prevent Failures

- Always declare expectations before code under test exercises mocks.
- Favor `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for actual verifications.
- Use sequences and partial orders to govern call order where it matters.
- Avoid over-specification of argument matchers; specify only what matters.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation` to prevent sticky expectations causing unintended failures.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` appropriately to control strictness and warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Explicitly verify and clear expectations on long-lived mocks.
- Avoid dependencies on test execution order and side effects.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Gotchas

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Multiple `WillOnce()` actions not matching call count">
GoogleMock expects the number of `WillOnce()` actions to correspond with expected calls. If your calls outnumber actions, later calls use default actions and may cause warnings or failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Sticky expectations blocking later calls">
By default, expectations are 'sticky' and remain active after saturation. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequence-based ordering to ensure saturated expectations don't block others.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing virtual destructors in interfaces">
Mocked classes must have virtual destructors to avoid undefined behavior and leaks when deleting through base class pointers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Order of `EXPECT_CALL` statements matters">
Because gMock matches calls against expectations in reverse declaration order, more specific expectations must be declared after general ones.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting calls producing warnings">
If no `EXPECT_CALL` exists for a called method, gMock prints warnings. Use `NiceMock` or explicit expectations to manage this noise.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mocking non-virtual methods is complex">
Mocking non-virtual methods requires unrelated mock classes and compile-time dependency injection techniques.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Additional Tools and Features for Debugging

- Use `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly allow calls, preventing uninteresting call warnings on noisy mocks.
- Employ `SCOPED_TRACE()` or custom failure messages in complex tests to add context to failure reports.
- Leverage `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to explicitly check mocks before critical test points.
- Use `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` flags to find flaky tests or dependency issues.
- For custom matchers and actions, try to implement informative failure messages to ease troubleshooting.

## 7. Summary Checklist for Diagnosing Test Failures

- [ ] Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs.
- [ ] Confirm all required expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) are set before exercise.
- [ ] Verify call order requirements with sequences or `.After()`.
- [ ] Review argument matchers for correctness and looseness where appropriate.
- [ ] Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to prevent blocking expectations.
- [ ] Check for uninteresting calls and use `NiceMock` or explicit expectations.
- [ ] Validate that mocks are destructed and verified properly.
- [ ] Investigate flaky tests with repeats and isolation.

## 9. Example: Diagnosing a Mismatched Call Count

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::AtLeast;

class MockTurtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  // Expect PenDown called at least once.
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(AtLeast(1));

  // Expect GetX called 3 times, returning increasing values.
  {
    InSequence s;

    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
        .WillOnce(Return(100))
        .WillOnce(Return(150))
        .WillOnce(Return(200));
  }

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle());
}
```

If the test fails with an "Actual function call count doesn't match" message, run with `--gmock_verbose=info` to check if `GetX()` was called more or less times than expected, or if the actual return values differ. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` if calls are in a known fixed order and count.
