# Understanding Assertion and Mock Failures

This page provides essential guidance on diagnosing failed assertions and unexpected behaviors in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It clarifies common causes of failures, explains how to interpret error messages, and offers practical advice to resolve issues efficiently.

---

## 1. Introduction

When working with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, encountering failures due to unmet assertions or unexpected mock behaviors is common. Understanding the reasons behind these failures and how to read their diagnostic messages will empower you to fix tests quickly and reliably.

Failures typically arise from:

- **Assertion Failures**: The code under test did not meet the specified test conditions.
- **Mock Expectation Violations**: Mock methods were called fewer or more times than expected, or with unexpected arguments.
- **Ordering and Cardinality Issues**: Calls not matching required invocation order or count.
- **Misconfigured Mocks**: Improper setup or misunderstanding of mock lifecycles.

This guide walks you through these scenarios, explaining key concepts and troubleshooting steps.

## 2. Assertion Failures

GoogleTest assertions check for expected conditions in your tests. When a condition is false, GoogleTest reports a failure with detailed information.

### Common Assertion Failure Causes

- **Incorrect Expected Value**: The actual result does not match the expected condition in your `EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*` macro.
- **Off-By-One Errors**: Index calculations or iterations returning unexpected values.
- **Logic Errors in Code or Test**: Errors in test logic or system under test causing unexpected state.

### Reading Failure Messages

GoogleTest failure messages include:

- The expression evaluated.
- Actual and expected values.
- Optional custom messages you've provided.
- Source file and line number of the failure.

For example:

```text
path/to/test.cc:45: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  actual
    Which is: 7
  expected
    Which is: 5
```

**Tips:**

- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers (e.g., `EXPECT_THAT(value, Ge(10))`) for expressive conditions.
- Leverage failure messages to pinpoint both the failure location and the mismatch.

### Troubleshooting

- Verify the test inputs, expected outputs, and logic carefully.
- Run the test with debugging enabled or with print statements to gather more context.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to halt tests at the first failure for interactive debugging.

## 3. Mock Expectation Failures

Mock failures occur when behaviors set via `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` are violated.

### Common Failure Types

- **Too Few Calls (Lower Bound Violation)**: A mock method expected to be called at least N times was called fewer times.

- **Too Many Calls (Upper Bound Violation)**: A mock method expected to be called at most N times was called more times.

- **Unexpected Calls**: A mock method was called with arguments that do not match any active expectation.

- **Uninteresting Calls**: A mock method was called with no expectation set, leading to a warning or error depending on mock behavior mode.

- **Ordering Violations**: Mock calls did not follow the prescribed strict or partial order.

### Understanding Cardinalities and Ordering

- Use `.Times(n)` or one of its variants (`AtLeast`, `AtMost`, `Between`) to specify how many times a method is expected.
- Omitting `.Times()` lets gMock infer cardinality from the presence of `WillOnce` / `WillRepeatedly` clauses.
- Use `InSequence` or `After` to enforce call order. Calls outside this order will produce errors.

### Typical Failure Message Explanation

```text
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Bar))...
Expected: to be called at least 2 times
Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active
```

This indicates the mock method was called less than expected.

Another example:

```text
Mock function call called more times than expected - returning default value.
Function call: Bar(42)
Expected: to be called once
Actual: called twice - over-saturated and active
```

This means a mock method was called more than expected.

## 4. Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls

GoogleMock distinguishes between two types of undesired mock calls:

- **Uninteresting Call:** No `EXPECT_CALL` expectation was set for the method. This triggers a warning by default but does not fail the test.
- **Unexpected Call:** Call arguments don’t match any existing `EXPECT_CALL`. This is always an error.

### Managing Uninteresting Calls

- Use **NiceMock** wrapper to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls.
- Use **StrictMock** wrapper to treat uninteresting calls as failures.
- Use catch-all expectations to allow certain calls, e.g.:

  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
  ```

  This allows `Foo` being called with any arguments without warnings.

### When to Use Each

- Default mocks are *naggy* (warning on uninteresting calls).
- Use `NiceMock` to clean up noisy tests.
- Use `StrictMock` when you want to enforce that no unexpected calls happen.

## 5. Common Mock Usage Mistakes

### Setting Expectations After Calls

Expectations must be set *before* the mock methods are invoked. Setting `EXPECT_CALL` after calls leads to undefined behavior and missed verifications.

### Missing Virtual Destructors

Mock classes must have **virtual destructors** to avoid resource leaks and undefined behaviors.

### Forgetting to Verify or Delete Mock Objects

If mock objects allocated on the heap are leaked, expectations won't be verified. Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if you cannot guarantee timely destruction.

### Misunderstanding Default Actions

By default, mock methods that return primitive or default-constructible types return default values unless otherwise specified. Use `ON_CALL` or `EXPECT_CALL().WillRepeatedly()` to define behaviors explicitly.

---

## 6. Diagnosing Failed Expectations

### Increasing Verbosity

Run tests with the command-line flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed logs of:

- Each mock method call and which expectation matched.
- Stack traces for calls to help pinpoint the call origins.

For example:

```bash
./my_test --gmock_verbose=info
```

### Analyzing Failure Output

- Identify which expectation failed and what the call arguments were.
- See which expectations were tried but did not match.
- Look at call order and cardinality messages.
- Check for unexpected or uninteresting calls.

### Handling Action Exhaustion Warnings

If you see warnings about the number of `WillOnce()` actions exceeding or falling short of the call count, verify your matchers and ensure `WillRepeatedly()` is set if calls may exceed `WillOnce()` number.

## 7. Best Practices for Mock Stability

- **Prefer `ON_CALL` for Default Behavior:** Use `ON_CALL` for setting default mock behaviors, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you explicitly want to verify.
- **Use Sequences to Control Order:** When needed, use `InSequence` or `After` to express required call order.
- **Retire Expectations Where Needed:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for non-sticky expectations.
- **Limit Over-Specification:** Match only on arguments relevant to the test.
- **Use Catch-All Expectations for Uninteresting Calls:** Prevent warnings by allowing unimportant calls explicitly.

## 8. Quick Reference: Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                         | Recommendation                                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Unexpected Mock Call          | Check argument matchers; add catch-all expectations or fix call parameters.
| Too Few Calls                 | Increase `.Times()` or ensure the code calls the mock expected number of times.
| Too Many Calls               | Decrease `.Times()` or add `.RetiresOnSaturation()`; confirm no redundant calls.
| Uninteresting Call Warnings  | Use `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for those methods.
| Ordering Errors              | Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses properly to enforce call order.
| Mock Not Verified            | Ensure mocks are destroyed or call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`.

## 10. Summary

Diagnosing assertion and mock failures is a critical skill for effective testing with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Understanding the root causes—be it mismatched arguments, incorrect call counts, or call ordering violations—and reading failure messages carefully enables confident resolution. Combining thoughtful expectation setting, mock lifecycle management, and leveraging diagnostic flags ensures test clarity and robustness.

Remember: always set expectations before exercising mocks, use the verbosity flags for deep insights, and balance strictness with flexibility using NiceMock or StrictMock as appropriate.
