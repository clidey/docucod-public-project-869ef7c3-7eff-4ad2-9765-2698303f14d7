# Platform-Specific Problems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a broad range of operating systems and compilers, but certain platform-specific behaviors, quirks, and integration details may impact how tests run. This page addresses common issues users face when running tests on various platforms, focusing on troubleshooting environment-dependent problems, compiler compatibility, and runtime nuances.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest requires a C++17 compliant environment and supports major platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, embedded targets (ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52), and others. Support details include:

- Windows Desktop and Mobile (including MinGW and Visual Studio 2015+)
- Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, BSD variants)
- Embedded platforms (Arduino variants with ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52)

Compiler requirements vary, but generally include:

- Visual Studio 2015 or higher on Windows
- GCC 7.0 or higher on Linux and embedded
- Clang with minimal C++17 support

If your platform or compiler does not meet these criteria, tests may fail to build or run as expected.

<Check>
Always verify your compiler supports C++17 fully before attempting to build GoogleTest.

## 2. Platform Detection Macros

GoogleTest uses platform-specific macros to adapt to the OS and compiler features. These are defined automatically and should not be modified.

Examples include:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_ESP32`, etc.
- Feature macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` (indicates pthread support), `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`.

These macros control inclusion of platform-specific code, synchronization primitives, and available test features.

## 3. Common Platform-Specific Issues

### 3.1 Linker and Runtime Compatibility on Windows

Windows users often face linker errors related to mismatched runtime libraries, such as:

```
gtest.lib(gtest-all.obj) : error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'
```

This typically occurs due to mixing static and dynamic C runtimes between GoogleTest and user projects.

**Solution:**

- Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align GoogleTest runtime usage with your project.
- Ensure consistent runtime linkage flags (`/MD` or `/MT`) across your entire build.

### 3.2 Missing pthread Library on Windows and Some Platforms

On Windows, GoogleTest does not use pthreads but native Windows threading APIs to maintain thread safety.

If compiling on non-Windows platforms that lack pthread support, enable or disable pthread detection explicitly using the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` compiler flag.

### 3.3 Embedded Platform Limitations

For embedded targets like ESP32, ESP8266, or NRF52:

- Stream redirection (`stdout`, `stderr`) is often unsupported.
- Some POSIX file system calls may be missing or unimplemented.
- Environment variables may not exist.

GoogleTest adapts to these constraints, but certain features like death tests or XML output may be limited or disabled.

### 3.4 Unicode and Wide String Support

Windows platforms use UTF-16 for wide strings, which GoogleTest handles internally. On some platforms (e.g., Android, embedded), `std::wstring` may be unavailable or incompatible.

Use `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING` macro to detect availability.

---

## 4. Flag Parsing and Command Line Considerations

`testing::InitGoogleTest()` parses command line flags specific to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. On some platforms, especially Windows with Unicode command lines, this parsing behaves differently.

- Windows supports wide-character command line arguments.
- GoogleTest handles this internally; no special action is needed by the user.

Avoid passing unsupported flags or malformed commands to prevent initialization errors.

---

## 5. Multi-threading and Synchronization

GoogleTest is thread-safe if pthreads or equivalent synchronization primitives are available.

- On Windows, native `CRITICAL_SECTION` and mutexes are used.
- On POSIX platforms, pthread mutexes are employed.

If your platform lacks proper threading support, GoogleTest will fallback to dummy no-op synchronization, making it unsafe to use assertions from multiple threads concurrently.

Use the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` to detect if thread safety is active.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### 6.1 Test Crashes or Hangs

- Ensure your platform's support libraries (like pthreads) are correctly linked if applicable.
- Avoid calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` more than once.
- On embedded systems, watch for limited heap or stack space affecting test stability.

### 6.2 Linker Errors and Missing Symbols

- Check that build and link flags match between your tests and GoogleTest libraries.
- For Windows, verify consistent CRT linkage (static vs dynamic).

### 6.3 Macro Conflicts

Multiple libraries defining similarly named macros can cause conflicts. Use the `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` and similar macros to rename GoogleTest macros if needed.

---

## 7. Best Practices for Cross-Platform Testing

- Use CMake or Bazel integration to correctly detect and configure platform-native settings.
- Rely on GoogleTest's automatic platform detection macros rather than manual overrides unless necessary.
- Avoid platform-specific code in tests; isolate such code in helper functions or fixtures.
- Test your test environment early by running simple sample tests.

---

## 8. Example: Customizing Platform Behavior

To explicitly enable pthread support on a platform where it's not auto-detected, pass this flag during compilation:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

Or disable it when pthread is unavailable:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

This helps prevent linking errors and unexpected runtime failures.

## 10. Summary

Understanding your platform's capabilities and limitations is critical when running GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Proper compiler selection, linking consistent runtimes, and awareness of embedded platform constraints ensure a smooth testing experience.

Always consult the platform and integration documentation to address build configurations and environment-specific needs.
