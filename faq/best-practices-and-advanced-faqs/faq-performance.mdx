# Performance and Optimization FAQ

This FAQ focuses specifically on practical tips, strategies, and common questions regarding improving the performance of your tests and sophisticated optimizations when using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, especially at scale.

## 1. How can I speed up my test execution?

- **Run tests in parallel:** Utilize `--jobs=N` or your build system's parallel test execution features to run multiple tests concurrently. This approach reduces overall test suite runtime linearly with the number of cores when tests are independent.

- **Use `GTEST_SHUFFLE` to randomize test execution:** This helps detect hidden dependencies or order-based flakiness early.

- **Filter tests with `--gtest_filter`:** Run only relevant tests targeting your current changes.

- **Use `--gtest_repeat`:** Repeat flaky or suspicious tests multiple times to identify intermittents.

- **Optimize fixtures and test setup:** Minimize expensive resource initialization. Use `SetUpTestSuite`/`TearDownTestSuite` for setup shared by all tests in a suite.

- **Leverage parameterized tests:** Avoid duplicating test code by parameterizing inputs.

## 2. How do I parallelize tests without causing flaky behavior?

- Avoid shared mutable global state across tests.
- Be cautious with mocks interacting with shared singletons or static data.
- Synchronize or isolate dependencies accessed by multiple threads.
- Use thread-safe expectations and verify proper mock destruction.
- Use sequence controls (`InSequence`, `Sequence`, and `After`) carefully to handle order dependencies only when needed.

## 3. What optimizations help reduce boilerplate in large test suites?

- **Custom test fixtures:** Create reusable fixtures encapsulating common mocks and setup steps.
- **Helper macros and functions:** Wrap repetitive patterns like common `EXPECT_CALL` setups.
- **Parameterized and typed tests:** Share test logic across multiple data types or parameter sets.
- **Use `ON_CALL` vs. `EXPECT_CALL` wisely:** Use `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior without setting expectations to reduce test noise.
- **Leverage `NiceMock` and `StrictMock`:** Control verbosity and strictness to your advantage.

### Example: Using Parallel Execution with GoogleTest

```sh
# Run tests with 8 parallel jobs and shuffle test order
./my_tests --jobs=8 --gtest_shuffle
```

### Example: Reducing Boilerplate via Parameterized Tests

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {
  // Reuse this fixture to test different integer values
};

TEST_P(MyTest, IsOdd) {
  int val = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(val % 2, 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(OddNumbers, MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 3, 5, 7));
```

## 4. How does GoogleMock’s verbosity setting affect performance?

Raising verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info` makes GoogleMock print extensive diagnostic details on every mock call. This slows down test execution but helps debugging. Use `warning` or `error` levels for better performance in production testing.

## 5. How can I optimize compilation speed for large mock classes?

- **Move constructor and destructor definitions out-of-line:** Define your mock class constructor and destructor in a `.cc` file instead of inline. This avoids re-generating heavy code in every translation unit.

- **Limit the number of mock methods:** Avoid mocking unnecessary interfaces or methods.

- **Use type aliases for complex argument or return types** to reduce parsing complexity inside `MOCK_METHOD`.

## 6. Common Pitfalls Impacting Performance

- Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` that are too strict—might cause failures requiring extensive test maintenance.
- Mock objects leaked without destruction cause verification to be skipped, hiding test problems.
- Tests running with global shared state without synchronization become flaky and time out when parallelized.

## 7. How do I control and reduce noisy warnings about uninteresting calls?

- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls.
- If you have uninteresting calls that are expected, add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for them, but do so sparingly to avoid over-specification.
- Adjust `--gmock_verbose` level to `error` if warnings are obstructive.

## 8. How to Verify and Clear Expectations Early to Avoid Leaked Mocks

If a mock object is allocated dynamically and the code under test owns its lifetime, your test may leak the mock if the owner fails to delete it. This causes expectation verification at destruction to be skipped.

Use `::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` after exercising the code to enforce earlier verification, preventing silent test fallout.

## 9. Best Practices for Highly Scalable Test Suites

- Organize tests in logical groups and fixtures to promote reusability.
- Use parameterized and typed tests to avoid code duplication.
- Keep mocks and expectations as simple as possible.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability of tests—complex mock setups complicate debugging and slow test runs.
- Regularly profile test execution time and identify slow tests; isolate and optimize them.

<Tip>
Use parallel and filtered test execution to drastically shorten iteration time. Balance verbosity settings for actionable insight without sacrificing speed. Simplify mock setups by leveraging parametrization and reusable fixtures.
</Tip>

<Note>
Always verify mocks and clear expectations in long-running or dynamically allocated scenarios to catch leaks and maintain accurate test outcomes.
</Note>

<Warning>
Never mix overly strict expectations with large randomized or parallelized test suites without proper ordering controls and synchronization.
</Warning>
