## Frequently Consulted Resources

Below you will find key documentation pages and guides organized to support both newcomers and experienced users as they navigate the subtleties of GoogleMock.

### 1. GoogleMock Cheat Sheet
A compact, ready-reference that covers the core syntax and patterns for defining and using mock classes.

- **What It Covers:** How to define mock classes, mock templates, setting default actions, using expectations (`ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`), matchers, actions, cardinalities, verification, and common flags.
- **Value:** Quick lookup to refresh syntax and find best practices for standard mocking tasks.
- **Example Excerpt:**

  ```cpp
  class MockFoo : public Foo {
   public:
    MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
    MOCK_METHOD(string, Describe, (const char* name), (override));
  };

  NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;  // Suppresses warnings on unexpected calls
  ```

### 2. GoogleMock Cookbook
A detailed guide with recipes and design patterns for advanced mocking scenarios.

- **What It Covers:** Techniques for mocking private, overloaded, and templated methods, controlling expectation ordering, delegating calls to fakes or real objects, mixing mock with fake, dealing with move-only types, custom actions and matchers.
- **User Flow Orientation:** Understand how to set up complex mocks and customize mock behavior using practical, example-driven explanations.
- **Example Topic:** Using `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and `NaggyMock` to control mock warning levels.

- **Link:** [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)

### 3. Legacy gMock FAQ
This FAQ addresses common problems and questions users encounter when working with GoogleMock, especially in edge cases or legacy environments.

- **Key Questions:** Why real methods get called instead of mocked ones, handling variadic functions, compiler warnings on const parameters, debugging unexpected calls, assertion errors, and more.
- **Helpful For:** Troubleshooting unexpected mock behaviors in your tests.

- **Link:** [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html)

### 4. Mocking Reference
Comprehensive API documentation detailing core mocking macros, classes, and usage patterns.

- **Included Topics:**
  - `MOCK_METHOD` syntax and parameter qualifiers
  - `EXPECT_CALL` chaining clauses like `Times()`, `InSequence()`, `After()`, `WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`, and `RetiresOnSaturation()`
  - `ON_CALL` default behavior specification
  - Supporting classes like `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, `Sequence`, `Expectation`, and `ExpectationSet`

- **Value:** Definitive resource to understand the API and chain modifiers for precise expectation control.

- **Link:** [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.md)

### 5. Strictness Modes and Policies
Covers the use of strictness wrappers `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to influence how uninteresting mock calls are handled.

- **Usage Scenario:** Suppress noisy warnings with `NiceMock`, enforce call restrictions with `StrictMock`, or retain default nagging behavior.
- **Practical Advice:** How to extend mock classes and configure test behaviors by wrapping your mock.

- **Example:**
  ```cpp
  NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething());
  // No warnings on unexpected calls to other methods.
  ```

## Best Practices & Tutorials

### Mocking Basics and Patterns
- Start by defining mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` for explicit calls you want to verify.
- Set default behaviors with `ON_CALL` when needed.
- Use `NiceMock` to reduce noisy warnings during tests.

### Managing Call Order and Expectations
- Use sequences (`Sequence` and `InSequence`) to specify call order.
- Use `.After()` for fine-grained call dependencies.
- Apply `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after they are met.

### Detecting and Handling Common Issues
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call traces.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to verify mocks before destruction if ownership is ambiguous.
- Employ tooling and logging to locate unexpected or uninteresting calls.

### Performance and Compilation
- Move mock class constructors and destructors to source files to speed compilation.
- Avoid mocking non-virtual methods unnecessarily.
