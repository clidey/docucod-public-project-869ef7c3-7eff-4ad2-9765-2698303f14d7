# Getting Help and Reporting Issues

This page provides authoritative guidance on how to access official support channels for GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including how to report bugs, request new features, and find extensive documentation and guides for troubleshooting advanced scenarios.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I get official support for GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

You can get help and support through the following official channels:

- **GitHub Issues:** Use the [Googletest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to submit bug reports or feature requests.
- **GoogleTest User's Guide:** Detailed documentation is available in the user guide, including tutorials, references, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Community Resources:** There are community-created documents and forums that you can tap into for advice and best practices.

### Where should I report bugs or request new features?

The preferred place is the GitHub Issues page for the project. When reporting:

- Provide a minimal reproducible example if possible.
- Include details about your environment, such as compiler version, OS, and build tools.
- Clearly describe the expected and actual behavior.

Feature requests should also follow the same process via GitHub to help maintainers prioritize them.

### Are there comprehensive guides on advanced usage and troubleshooting?

Yes. There are several guides and references you can consult:

- **Mocking Cookbook and gMock for Dummies:** If you want to learn mocking patterns and advanced usage.
- **Mocking Reference and API docs:** For deep dives into macros like `MOCK_METHOD` and `EXPECT_CALL`, and advanced mocking APIs.
- **FAQ pages:** Cover common issues from setup questions to assertions and mocking patterns.

### How can I troubleshoot unexpected test failures?

- Run tests with verbose logging enabled (e.g., `--gmock_verbose=info`) to trace mock function calls and match expectations.
- Check common pitfalls such as incorrect expectations, missing virtual destructors, or misused mock macros.
- Review the GoogleMock FAQ for detailed explanations of typical error messages.

### Can I get help integrating GoogleTest with my build system or IDE?

Integration guidance is available through dedicated platform-specific and ecosystem integration guides. They cover:

- Setup using CMake or Bazel
- Continuous Integration workflows
- IDE plugins and external test runners

### Are there community resources for additional help?

Yes. The community maintains various resources such as:

- Community-created documentation and tutorials
- Forums and discussion groups
- External tutorials and blog posts

These resources complement official documentation for enhanced learning.

## Common Support Procedures

### How to File a Quality Bug Report

1. Search open and closed issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Clearly describe the problem including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected and actual outcomes
   - Code snippets or small test cases
3. Provide environment details:
   - Operating system and version
   - Compiler and version
   - GoogleTest and GoogleMock version
4. Attach logs or error messages.

### How to Make Effective Feature Requests

1. Clearly explain the problem or gap the feature addresses.
2. Provide use cases or example scenarios.
3. Suggest design ideas if available.
4. Be open to community discussion and refinement.

### How to Ask Questions Effectively

- Use precise language and include context.
- Share minimal code samples if relevant.
- Check documentation and previous issues beforehand.

## Troubleshooting Advanced Scenarios

### Enabling Verbose Logging for Mock Debugging

Use the command line flag:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This outputs detailed information on every mock function call, which expectation it matches, and stack traces to help identify failures.

### Handling Mock Verification Failures

- Verify that all `EXPECT_CALL`s are set before exercising mocks.
- Ensure destructors are virtual for classes you mock.
- Check if mock objects are properly destroyed to trigger verification.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object)` to force verification earlier.

### Addressing Common Error Messages

- **Uninteresting function call:** Indicates a mock method was called without expectation; add an `EXPECT_CALL` or use a `NiceMock` to suppress warnings.
- **Lower/upper bound violation:** Indicates a mocked method was called fewer or more times than expected; revisit your `Times()` specification.
- **Match failures:** Check your matchers and ensure arguments match expectations.

Refer to the [Legacy gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html) for a compiled list of common errors and explanations.
