# Support and Community Resources

Welcome to the Support and Community Resources page. Here, you will find official avenues to get help, participate in the GoogleTest community, discover helpful documentation contributed by users, and learn how to contribute yourself. Whether you're reporting an issue, seeking advice, or simply wanting to engage with fellow users and contributors, this page guides you toward the best resources.

## 1. Getting Official Support

When you encounter issues, need guidance, or want to report bugs related to GoogleTest or GoogleMock, use the following official channels:

- **GitHub Issues:** Report bugs, request features, or ask questions directly on the official [GoogleTest GitHub repository issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues). Include detailed descriptions, environment info, and code snippets whenever possible to help maintainers diagnose problems faster.

- **Mailing Lists and Forums:** While GoogleTest does not maintain an official mailing list, discussion and help can often be found on public forums such as Stack Overflow by tagging questions with `googletest`.

- **Support in Commercial Environments:** If you are using GoogleTest within a company or organization, consider internal support procedures or commercial partners that specialize in C++ testing frameworks.

<Tip>
Before opening new issues or questions, please review existing issues and documentation first to avoid duplicates and quickly find solutions.
</Tip>

## 2. Exploring Community Documentation

Many users and contributors have created valuable documentation to supplement the official guides. Here are some useful community resources:

- **Googlemock Insights:** An in-depth exploration of GoogleMock features and nuances, available on GitHub: [Googlemock Insights](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md).

- **Community Tutorials and Examples:** Various blogs, repositories, and tutorials exist showcasing real-world usage patterns and examples. These are often uncovered through community forums or GitHub repository searches.

<Tip>
Community-created content can offer practical and innovative uses that complement the official doc. Evaluate their relevance to your needs.
</Tip>

## 3. Forums and Discussion Channels

Engagement with peers is invaluable for troubleshooting and knowledge sharing.

- **Stack Overflow:** Search and post questions tagged with `googletest` and `googlemock` for wider community help.

- **GitHub Discussions (where enabled):** Some GitHub repositories enable Discussions for community Q&A.

- **Social Media and Developer Communities:** Platforms such as Reddit r/cpp, C++ Slack workspaces, or Discord servers for C++ developers often house active conversations about GoogleTest.

<Tip>
When asking for help, provide clear information including GoogleTest version, platform details, and minimal reproducible examples.
