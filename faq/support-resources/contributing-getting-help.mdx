# Reporting Problems and Getting More Help

This page guides you through the process of reporting bugs, requesting new features, and obtaining support for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It explains how to use issue trackers, what information to provide in support requests, and how to navigate contributing guidelines to get the most efficient and effective assistance.

## 1. How to Report Bugs and Request Features

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open-source projects managed through GitHub. To report issues or request features, you should use the GitHub issue tracker responsibly and efficiently.

### Steps for Effective Bug Reporting:

- **Search for Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, use GitHub's search functionality to check if the problem or feature request has already been reported or discussed.

- **Use the Correct Repository:** Submit issues only in the [`https://github.com/google/googletest`](https://github.com/google/googletest) repository.

- **Provide a Clear and Descriptive Title:** Summarize the problem or feature request in a concise, informative title.

- **Include Detailed Information:** Provide the following to help developers reproduce and diagnose the issue:

  - Environment details such as OS, compiler and version, GoogleTest version, and employed build system (e.g., CMake or Bazel).
  - Clear description of the problem or the feature you want.
  - Minimal, reproducible code snippet or test case that triggers the problem.
  - Exact steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Expected and actual behavior.
  - Error messages or stack traces, if any.

- **Tag Appropriately:** Use labels or tags to identify the area affected, such as `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question`.

### Requesting Features

For feature requests, clearly explain the use case, expected benefit, and possible interface or implementation ideas if you have them. This helps maintainers evaluate and prioritize your request quickly.

## 2. Getting Support and Assistance

When you need help or have questions about GoogleTest or GoogleMock, follow these recommended routes:

### Official Documentation

- Start with the official [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs) and [GoogleMock README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/README.md).
- Consult FAQs for common problems and solutions:
  - [Getting Started Issues FAQ](/faq/common-issues-solutions/getting-started-issues)
  - [Mocking and Expectation Failures FAQ](/faq/common-issues-solutions/mocking-failures)
  - [Test Discovery and Execution Issues FAQ](/faq/common-issues-solutions/test-discovery-running)

### Community Resources

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock have active user communities on forums such as Stack Overflow; use tags `googletest` and `googlemock`.
- Refer to community-created documentation and insights for additional help.

### When Seeking Direct Help

To get prompt and useful assistance when posting questions on forums or issues:

- Clearly describe your environment including versions and setup instructions.
- Provide minimal example code that reproduces your problem.
- Show exact error or failure messages.
- Describe what you've tried and where you got stuck.

This approach helps responders understand your issue quickly and provide precise guidance.

## 3. Contributing to GoogleTest and GoogleMock

If you intend to contribute fixes or features:

- Follow the contributing guidelines listed in the GitHub repository.
- Write clear commit messages that explain your changes.
- Include tests that verify your fixes or new features.
- Run the full GoogleTest suite before submitting pull requests.

Engaging respectfully and following these procedures ensures your contributions can be reviewed and merged effectively.

## 4. Quick Tips and Best Practices

- Do not report setup or build issues without first consulting the [Installation and Setup Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/guides/getting-started/installation-setup) and [Prerequisites & Requirements](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-requirements).
- Include screenshots or terminal output snippets in issues, if applicable.
- For performance issues, refer to the [Performance and Integration FAQ](/faq/performance-integration/build-system-integration) before reporting.
- Avoid vague problem descriptions; aim for reproducibility.

## 5. Where to File Issues and Requests

Use the official GitHub issue tracker for the `googletest` project:

- Issue Tracker URL: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

The maintainers monitor this page and respond according to issue labels and priority.

## 6. Example of a Good Issue Report

```
Title: "EXPECT_CALL macro causes spurious failure with const pointer argument"

Body:
---
Environment:
- Windows 10, Visual Studio 2019
- GoogleTest version: v1.17.0
- Using CMake 3.20

Description:
When using EXPECT_CALL with a const pointer argument, the test fails unexpectedly even though the arguments match.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define a mock method with a const char* argument.
2. Set EXPECT_CALL with an argument matcher explicitly matching a const char*.
3. Call the method with matching argument.

Expected:
The test should pass since the arguments match.

Actual:
The test fails with a message indicating argument mismatch.

Snippet:
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(void, Print, (const char* message), (override));
};

TEST(PrintTest, HandlesConstPointer) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Print(StrEq("hello")));
  mock.Print("hello");
}
```

Additional Info:
Using verbose flag --gmock_verbose=info provides no useful hints.
