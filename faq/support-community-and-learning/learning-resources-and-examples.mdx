## Official Learning Materials

The GoogleTest project offers a series of well-structured guides and references that form the foundation for learning and effectively using the framework.

### GoogleTest Primer

Start here if you are new to GoogleTest. The Primer guides you through writing simple tests and understanding core concepts like test fixtures and assertions.

[GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) — a beginner-friendly introduction to writing your first tests.

### GoogleTest Advanced

Once comfortable with the basics, this guide dives deeper into advanced testing techniques, value-parameterized tests, typed tests, and test environment setup.

[GoogleTest Advanced](advanced.md) — unlock the full potential of GoogleTest.

### GoogleTest Samples

Browse well-commented sample test programs illustrating various GoogleTest features, including fixtures, parameterized tests, listener APIs, and more.

[GoogleTest Samples](samples.md) — practical sample tests showcasing common scenarios.

### GoogleMock Documentation

For mastering mocking, an integral part of writing effective tests for C++:

- [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html): A gentle introduction to write and use mocks.
- [Mocking Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html): Recipes and idioms for common mocking tasks.
- [Mocking Cheat Sheet](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cheat_sheet.html): Handy reference for matchers, actions, and expectations.
- [Mocking FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html): Answers to common mocking-related questions.

These resources offer progressive learning, practical examples, and detailed explanations.
