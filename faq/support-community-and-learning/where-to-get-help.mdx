# Where Can I Get Help or Report Issues?

GoogleTest is a widely used C++ unit testing and mocking framework with an active community and official support channels. When you require assistance, want to report bugs, or contribute improvements, several dedicated resources are available to you.

---

## Official Support Resources

### 1. GitHub Issues

The primary channel for reporting bugs, requesting features, or tracking known problems is the **GitHub Issues** page of the GoogleTest repository:

- GitHub Issues: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

When submitting a new issue, please provide clear and concise details including your environment, reproducing steps, code snippets, and any error messages encountered. This helps maintainers replicate and address your concerns efficiently.

### 2. Community Forums and Discussions

GoogleTest users often share knowledge and solutions in various community forums:

- GitHub Discussions (if enabled on the repository)
- Stack Overflow (tagged with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest))

These platforms allow interactive Q&A where you can ask questions and learn from others’ experiences. Be sure to search existing threads to avoid duplicates.

### 3. Contribution Guidelines

If you’re interested in contributing to GoogleTest's codebase, you can refer to the **CONTRIBUTING.md** or repository documentation:

- GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

This resource covers how to set up your environment, coding style, code review process, and requirements for submitting pull requests.

## How to Get Help Effectively

- **Search First**: Look up your issue in existing GitHub issues, discussion threads, or Q&A forums.
- **Provide Context**: Share the version of GoogleTest, compiler, OS, and minimal reproducible code samples.
- **Use Relevant Keywords**: When searching or reporting, use clear error messages or feature names.
- **Be Patient and Courteous**: Open source maintainers and community members volunteer their time.
