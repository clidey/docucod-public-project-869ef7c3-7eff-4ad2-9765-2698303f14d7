## Getting Started with Contribution

### 1. Understanding the Project
Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the project by exploring the documentation, browsing the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest), and reading the source code. Understanding its structure, core concepts, and guidelines will help you contribute more effectively.

### 2. Reporting Bugs and Issues
If you encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or have feature ideas, please report them through the GitHub Issues tracker:

- **File a clear, descriptive issue:** Include detailed steps to reproduce the problem, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant environment information.
- **Search existing issues first:** To avoid duplicates, check if the issue or feature request has already been reported.

Effective issue reporting helps maintainers prioritize and address problems promptly.

### 3. Contributing Code
GoogleTest/GoogleMock welcomes code contributions from the community following these best practices:

- **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project to safely experiment.
- **Create a feature branch:** Develop your fix or feature in a separate branch to keep changes isolated.
- **Follow coding style and guidelines:** Adhere to the Google C++ style and existing project conventions to maintain consistency.
- **Write tests:** Ensure your changes are well-tested to prevent regressions.
- **Document your changes:** Update or add documentation to explain new features or important modifications.
- **Submit a pull request (PR):** Provide a clear description of your changes, motivations, and any relevant context.

### 4. Code Review and Feedback
Your pull request will undergo review by project maintainers and the community:

- Be responsive to feedback and ready to refine your submission.
- Engage constructively to improve your contribution and the project.

This collaborative process helps maintain code quality and project standards.

### 5. Mailing Lists and Discussion Forums
Join community discussions to ask questions, share experiences, and stay updated:

- GoogleTest Google Group (googletestframework@@googlegroups.com)
- GitHub Discussions or other community forums

Active participation fosters knowledge sharing and collective growth.

### 6. Contribution License Agreement
Ensure you comply with the project's licensing (BSD 3-Clause License) and contribution policies. Review the license and provide any necessary contributor agreements if prompted.

## Best Practices for Effective Contribution

- **Start small:** Begin with minor bug fixes, documentation improvements, or test additions.
- **Engage early:** Discuss significant feature proposals before implementation.
- **Write clear commit messages:** Explain the "why" and "what" of your changes.
- **Maintain backward compatibility:** Respect existing APIs and behaviors unless changes are justified.
- **Stay up to date:** Keep your fork in sync with the main repository.
