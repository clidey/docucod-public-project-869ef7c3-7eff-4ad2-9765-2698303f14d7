# Getting Started and First Steps

Welcome to GoogleTest and GoogleMock! This FAQ page addresses the typical questions you may have when installing, configuring, and starting to use these powerful C++ testing frameworks. Whether you’re verifying platform compatibility, understanding how to compile and run your first test suite, or overcoming common initial hurdles, this page is your first stop for smooth onboarding.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What platforms and C++ versions does GoogleTest support?

GoogleTest supports major platforms including Linux, Windows, and macOS. It requires a compiler with C++17 support or newer. Supported compilers are GCC (7.3+), Clang, and MSVC with appropriate C++17 flags enabled. The library also supports common toolsets like CMake (version 3.14+) and Bazel.

<Info>
Check the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../../../getting-started/essential-setup/prerequisites-requirements) for the full list and setup tips.
</Info>

### 2. How do I install and build GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

You can build GoogleTest and GoogleMock from source using your preferred build system:

- **CMake**: Clone the repo and use `cmake` commands to generate build files and compile.
- **Bazel**: Use Bazel build commands directly on the repository.

Both methods produce libraries you can link against in your projects.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
git checkout main
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build with CMake">
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../googletest
cmake --build .
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build with Bazel">
```bash
bazel build //googletest:all
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Detailed instructions are in the [Installation (All Platforms)](../../../getting-started/essential-setup/installation-multiple-platforms) guide.

### 3. How do I write a simple test using GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

Start by including the headers `<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>`. Define your tests using the `TEST` macro from GoogleTest to create test cases.

If you need mocks, define a mock class by inheriting the interface and using `MOCK_METHOD` macros to mock virtual methods.

Here's a minimal example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::Return;

class User {
 public:
  virtual ~User() = default;
  virtual int GetAge() const = 0;
};

class MockUser : public User {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetAge, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(UserTest, AgeIsCorrect) {
  MockUser user;
  EXPECT_CALL(user, GetAge())
      .WillOnce(Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(user.GetAge(), 42);
}
```

### 4. How do I run the tests and verify results?

After compiling your test executable,

- Run it directly from the command line.
- It will execute all test cases by default.
- The framework reports success/failure with detailed messages.

You can customize test runs with command-line flags like `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests.

Example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=UserTest.*
```

See the [Test Execution and Configuration](../../../api-reference/core-testing-api/test-execution) documentation for advanced usage.

### 5. What are common issues when getting started?

- **Build failures**: Ensure supported compiler versions and C++17 flags.
- **Linker errors**: Ensure correct linkage to GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- **Uninteresting mock calls warnings**: Adjust mock strictness using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock` (default), or `StrictMock`.
- **Test discovery failures**: Check that test files and functions use proper macros.

Refer to the [Quickstart & Troubleshooting](../../../getting-started/quickstart-and-troubleshooting/troubleshooting-validation) guide for detailed diagnosis and solutions.

### 6. What are NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock?

These are wrapper templates that control how mock objects treat uninteresting calls (calls to mock methods without explicit expectations):

- **NiceMock**: Silences warnings for uninteresting calls. Use when you want quieter output.
- **NaggyMock**: Default behavior. Prints warnings for uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Usage example:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockUser> user;
```

For more, see the [Strictness Levels: Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks](../../../concepts/mocking-and-behavior-modeling/strictness-nice-naggy) documentation.

### 7. How do I define and set expectations on mock objects?

Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set expectations on mock methods, specifying expected arguments, call counts, ordering, and behavior.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(user, GetAge())
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return(30));
```

For common expect call clauses like `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.InSequence()`, see the [Setting Expectations and Call Sequencing](../../../api-reference/mocking-api/expectations-and-sequencing) reference.

### 8. How do I suppress or adjust warning verbosity?

Control the amount of logging with the command-line flag:

```
--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error
```

Where:

- `info`: detailed logs including call tracing
- `warning`: default, shows warnings and errors
- `error`: shows errors only

You can also set this programmatically:

```cpp
::testing::FLAGS_gmock_verbose = "error";
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Setup and Build Problems">
<Accordion title="Build errors due to unsupported C++ version">
Ensure your compiler supports C++17 and the build system uses the proper flags. Use GCC 7.3+, Clang with C++17 enabled, or recent MSVC compilers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors related to GoogleTest or GoogleMock">
Verify libraries are correctly linked and library paths set in your build environment. Follow installation guides for your build system.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup title="Test Execution Problems">
<Accordion title="Tests not discovered or running">
Make sure tests use the `TEST`, `TEST_F`, or `TEST_P` macros and that your build includes the generated test binaries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting mock function call warnings">
Decide whether to ignore these with `NiceMock`, see the sections on mock strictness. You can suppress warnings when necessary.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup title="Mock Usage Issues">
<Accordion title="Expectations not set before calling mock methods">
Always set expectations using `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising the code that calls mock methods. Setting expectations after calls is undefined behavior.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected or excess calls to mocks">
Check your expectations’ cardinalities with `.Times()`. Adjust mock strictness or catch-all expectations with wildcards `_` and `Times(AnyNumber())` if needed.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Systematic Debugging Approach

1. **Verify environment and build setup**: correct compiler and flags.
2. **Build test binaries and ensure linkage**.
3. **Run simple tests first and check for failures or warnings**.
4. **Adjust mock strictness or add expectations if warnings arise**.
5. **Use verbose logging with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls**.
6. **Isolate issues with simplified test cases**.

### Preventing Pitfalls

- Avoid setting expectations after mock calls.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` when you want expectations to deactivate after matches.
- Use sequences or `InSequence` to enforce call order.
