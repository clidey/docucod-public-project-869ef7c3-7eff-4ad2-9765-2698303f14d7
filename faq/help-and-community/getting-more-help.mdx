## Common Issues and How to Get Support

<AccordionGroup title="Common Support Topics">
<Accordion title="Installation and Setup Problems">
Ensure your environment meets prerequisites: correct compiler with C++17 support, properly installed build tools (e.g., CMake or Bazel), and linked libraries. Refer to the [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](../../getting_started/setup_requirements/prerequisites_platforms) and [Preparing Your Environment](../../getting_started/setup_requirements/environment_preparation) guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mocking and Expectation Errors">
For issues with mock expectations, or unexpected/uninteresting calls, consult the detailed explanations in the [Legacy gMock FAQ](../gmock_faq.md) and [Mocking Reference](../reference/mocking.md). Running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` can give insightful logs to diagnose failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build and Integration Challenges">
Problems linking GoogleTest and GoogleMock are common. Check your build configurations, ensure only one `main()` is linked, and validate linking order. See the [Integration & Build Failures FAQ](../faq/troubleshooting-advanced/integration-build-failures.mdx) for targeted advice.
</Accordion>

## Reporting Guidelines

When reporting issues or requesting support, keep in mind:

- Include a minimal code example to illustrate the problem clearly.
- Specify your test scenario, what you expect vs. what happens.
- Use the latest stable release or include version info if using a development build.
- For performance or flaky tests, provide details about your setup and system load.

Providing thorough information helps maintainers and the community resolve your issue faster.

## Best Practices for Seeking Help

- **Be Specific:** Focus your question on one problem at a time.
- **Replicate:** Try to isolate and reproduce the problem in a minimal test case.
- **Search First:** Use existing docs, FAQs, and previous issues/answers before posting.
- **Respect Maintainership:** Use issue tracker appropriatelyâ€”issues for bugs and feature requests; community forums for usage questions.

<Check>
Remember, setting expectations correctly in mocks prevents common test failures. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only when verifying interactions.
</Check>

<Note>
Running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` enhances visibility into mock calls and matching, aiding fast diagnosis.
