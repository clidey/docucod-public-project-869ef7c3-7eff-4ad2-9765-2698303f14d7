# Assertions, Matchers, and Output Issues FAQ

Welcome to this focused FAQ aimed at helping you confidently navigate GoogleTest assertion macros, matcher expectations, and interpreting test output and diagnostic messages. This resource guides you through common scenarios where test assertions behave unexpectedly, matchers produce surprising results, or output is unclear, so you can fix tests quickly and write more robust checks.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Macros

### Q1: What is the difference between `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` macros?

- **`EXPECT_` macros** report *nonfatal failures* and allow the current test function to continue executing.
- **`ASSERT_` macros** report *fatal failures* and immediately abort the current test function.

**Use case:** Use `EXPECT_` when you want all assertions in a test to run to collect multiple failures; use `ASSERT_` when subsequent code depends on a successful check.

### Q2: How can I add custom failure messages to assertions?

Use the streaming operator `<<` after the assertion macro to add contextual info:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(x, y) << "Expected x and y to be equal but they differ";
```

This message will be appended to GoogleTest's default failure output.

### Q3: Can assertion macros handle wide strings or custom objects?

Yes. GoogleTest automatically converts wide strings (e.g., `wchar_t*`) to UTF-8 for output. For custom types, implement streaming `operator<<` or an `AbslStringify()` function in the namespace of your type for readable failure messages.

### Q4: Are arguments of assertion macros evaluated multiple times?

No. Each argument is evaluated exactly once per assertion to avoid side effects. For example, `EXPECT_EQ(++i, 5)` increments `i` only once.

## 2. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Failures

### Q5: Pointer comparisons with `EXPECT_EQ` look confusing. How to compare C strings by content?

`EXPECT_EQ` compares pointer addresses for pointers, so comparing C strings this way may cause unexpected passes/fails.

**Solution:** Use string-specific macros:

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` for equality by content.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` for inequality by content.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ("hello", some_cstring);
```

### Q6: What if I want to compare floating-point numbers? Why use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`?

Floating-point rounding errors make exact equality unsuitable.

- Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` or `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` to assert numbers approximately equal within 4 units in the last place (ULPs).
- Alternatively, use `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` to specify a custom allowable absolute error.

### Q7: Tests involving exceptions don't behave as expected.

GoogleTest supports exception assertions if exceptions are enabled:

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, ExceptionType)` verifies an exception of given type is thrown.
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` verifies any exception is thrown.
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` verifies no exception is thrown.

Make sure exceptions are enabled in your build system.

### Q8: How do I explicitly mark a test success or failure?

- Use `SUCCEED()` to document or mark an explicit success (has no effect on overall test outcome).
- Use `FAIL()` to raise a fatal failure immediately.
- Use `ADD_FAILURE()` to raise a non-fatal failure.

Example:

```cpp
if (invalid_condition) {
  FAIL() << "Invalid condition encountered";
}
```

### Q9: I want to skip a test dynamically during execution.

Use the `GTEST_SKIP()` macro, optionally with a descriptive message:

```cpp
GTEST_SKIP() << "Skipping test due to unmet precondition";
```

Skipping works in tests, environments, and fixtures.

## 3. Working with Matchers and Predicates

### Q10: What is `EXPECT_THAT` and how do I use it with matchers?

`EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` lets you verify complex conditions and set expectations using expressive matchers defined in GoogleMock.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StartsWith;
EXPECT_THAT(value, StartsWith("Hello"));
```

Matchers generate readable failure messages, e.g., "Expected: starts with 'Hello'".

### Q11: How can I write custom predicate assertions?

GoogleTest offers predicate assertions for complex checks with clearer failure messages:

- `EXPECT_PRED1(pred, val1)`, `EXPECT_PRED2(pred, val1, val2)`, etc., where `pred` returns `bool`.
- `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(pred_formatter, val1)`, etc., where `pred_formatter` returns `AssertionResult` and formats failure messages.

Use predicate-formatters when you want fully customized error outputs.

Example predicate:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}
EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4));
```

## 4. Interpreting Output and Diagnostic Messages

### Q12: Why do assertion failure messages show both expected and actual values?

To help debugging, GoogleTest outputs:

- The expressions tested.
- Their evaluated values, if printable.
- Differences (unified diff) for string comparisons when multiline.

This readable format points to the root cause of failure rapidly.

### Q13: How do I verify that certain code triggers a fatal or non-fatal failure?

Use the following macros for testing expected failures in your tests:

- `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(statement, "substring")` expects a fatal failure with text containing "substring".
- `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(statement, "substring")` expects a non-fatal failure.

They help automate test utility verification or test meta-tests.

### Q14: The test output is colored, but I want to disable it. How?

Control colors with the flag:

- `--gtest_color=yes|no|auto` (default is `auto`)

Or environment variable:

- `GTEST_COLOR` with the same values.

Use `no` to disable colored output.

### Q15: How do I generate XML or JSON reports?

Use the `--gtest_output` flag:

- `--gtest_output=xml[:file_path_or_dir]` produces XML report.
- `--gtest_output=json[:file_path_or_dir]` produces JSON report.

If no file is specified, output is placed at default locations like `test_detail.xml`.

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use `ASSERT_` macros when failure should halt the test immediately.
- Use `EXPECT_` macros to continue executing tests after failures.
- Use streaming messages with assertions to clarify failure causes.
- Use `EXPECT_STREQ`/`ASSERT_STREQ` for C string content comparisons.
- Use floating-point-specific assertions for approximate equality.
- Use predicate or matcher-based assertions for complex logic.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` or `testing::ScopedTrace` to add context to failures in subroutines.
- Prefer `GTEST_SKIP()` to dynamically prevent test execution when preconditions fail.
- Avoid mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` within the same test suite.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Assertions and Matchers">
<Accordion title="Assertion Macros Aborting Prematurely">
Make sure fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`) are only used in `void` return functions. If returning a non-void type, use non-fatal assertions like `EXPECT_*` or refactor the function to return void.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Matcher Failure Messages">
Check that the types of values and matchers are compatible. Use the provided matchers from GoogleMock or write custom matchers for your type. To understand failure messages, read the "Value of" and "Expected" sections carefully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Comparison of C Strings Fails Even When Content Matches">
Remember to use `EXPECT_STREQ` (or `ASSERT_STREQ`) to compare C strings by content rather than pointer addresses.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Floating Point Comparison Fails Nearby Values">
Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` instead of `EXPECT_EQ` to compare floats and doubles approximately. For custom tolerances, use `EXPECT_NEAR`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Assertion Macros Ignore Custom Streaming Messages">
Verify that messages are correctly streamed using `<<` immediately after the assertion macro and that the streamed objects implement `operator<<` properly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
