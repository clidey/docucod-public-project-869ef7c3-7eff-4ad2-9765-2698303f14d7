# FAQ: Getting Started & Common Setup Issues

Welcome to the troubleshooting hub designed to get you past the initial hurdles when setting up GoogleTest. Whether it's about missing dependencies, build errors, or any linking issues, this guide will walk you through practical solutions to get your tests compiled and running smoothly.

---

## 1. Common Questions

### Why does my build fail due to missing dependencies?
Many build failures stem from missing or misconfigured dependencies such as the C++ standard library, threading support, or the GoogleTest source itself. Ensure your build environment meets the [System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-requirements/system-prerequisites.md). Missing or incompatible compiler versions are a frequent cause.

### How do I correctly include GoogleTest in my project?
You need to correctly add GoogleTest headers and compile/link the appropriate sources or pre-built libraries. Follow the installation instructions based on your build system, such as [Installing with CMake](../getting-started/installation-initialization/install-cmake.md) or [Other Installation Methods](../getting-started/installation-initialization/integration-other-methods.md).

### Why am I getting unresolved symbol errors during linking?
This typically means the GoogleTest library or object files are not linked. Verify:

- GoogleTest source or library is added to your linker inputs.
- You're linking against the correct GoogleTest variant (e.g., the compiled `gtest` or `gtest_main` library).
- The compilation units and GoogleTest library use compatible compiler flags and runtime settings.

### My tests are not being discovered or executed. What should I do?
Check that your test executables correctly call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Also, ensure your tests are defined with the correct `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros and are not disabled (look for `DISABLED_` prefixes).

### Why do some of my tests run but produce unexpected errors or crashes?
This can arise from:

- Improper fixture setup or resource initialization.
- Using assertions improperly, for example placing fatal assertions in non-void functions or constructors.
- Linking multiple conflicting versions of GoogleTest or incompatible compiler/library settings.

Refer to the detailed [GoogleTest Primer](../docs/primer.md) for correct test writing practices.

## 2. Setup & Build Troubleshooting

### Verifying Compiler and Platform Compatibility

- Confirm your compiler supports at least C++17 as required (see [System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-requirements/system-prerequisites.md)).
- Match compiler flags between GoogleTest and project code.
- Use tested compilers like GCC, Clang, or MSVC supported by GoogleTest.

### Correct Inclusion of Headers

- Use `#include "gtest/gtest.h"` for tests.
- Verify your include paths point correctly to GoogleTest headers.

### Linking GoogleTest

- If building from source, compile GoogleTest and GoogleMock source files alongside your tests.
- If using pre-built libraries, link against these correctly.
- On Windows, ensure proper linkage conventions and runtime libraries.

### Using CMake

- Use provided CMake targets in the GoogleTest repository.
- Call `FetchContent` or `add_subdirectory` to integrate GoogleTest.
- Verify your `CMakeLists.txt` includes `target_link_libraries(your_test gtest gtest_main)`.

### Bazel and Other Systems

- Follow respective build guides, ensuring the correct workspace setup.
- For manual build systems, compile GoogleTest sources explicitly.

### Common Errors and Their Fixes

| Error Message                                            | Likely Cause                   | Solution                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `undefined reference to 'testing::'`                    | Missing link to GoogleTest     | Link with gtest library or compile gtest sources           |
| `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory` | Incorrect include path         | Add GoogleTest include path to build configuration          |
| `multiple definition of`                                | Conflicting GoogleTest versions | Ensure single GoogleTest version is linked; clean build    |
| Build warnings about threading or C++ version            | Unsupported compiler or flags | Upgrade compiler or adjust flags to C++17 or higher        |

## 3. Frequently Encountered Pitfalls

- **Using ASSERT_* in constructors or non-void functions:** Fatal assertions abort the current function but cannot be used in constructors or functions with return values. Use `SetUp()` or helper functions instead. See [Advanced Guide: Assertion Placement](../docs/advanced.md#assertion-placement).

- **Uninitialized or misplaced test fixture setup:** Setup/teardown methods should be named `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` (not `Setup()`) and properly overridden.

- **Disabled tests not running:** Disabled tests have names prefixed with `DISABLED_`. They won't run unless you pass `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

- **Linking order matters:** Static libraries must be linked in the correct order, with dependencies coming after dependents.

---

## 4. Additional Validation Tips

- Run provided [Sample Tests](../getting-started/first-test-experience/run-sample-tests.md) to verify your installation.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to list detected tests, confirming discovery.
- Enable verbose output with `--gtest_verbose=info` to get more insight on what tests are run and why others may be skipped.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information for debugging failures.

## 5. Where to Get Help

- Review official documentation, starting with the [GoogleTest Primer](../docs/primer.md) and [Installation Guides](../getting-started/installation-initialization/).
- Visit the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) for issues and discussions.
- Ask questions on community forums or mailing lists related to GoogleTest.

**Proactive Advice:**

When you face a setup or build issue, start by verifying your environment against the [System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-requirements/system-prerequisites.md), then validate your installation by running sample tests. Keep your build system clean (rebuilt if needed), and ensure consistent compiler and settings usage throughout.
