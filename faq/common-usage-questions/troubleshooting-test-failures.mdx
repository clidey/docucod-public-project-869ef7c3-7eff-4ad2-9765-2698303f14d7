# Troubleshooting Test Failures

This page guides you through diagnosing and resolving common causes of unexpected test failures in GoogleTest. It clarifies how assertion misuse, test runner behavior, and platform-specific quirks can lead to confusing failures, and equips you with practical advice to identify and fix such issues.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did my test fail unexpectedly?
Unexpected failures often arise from misunderstanding the difference between fatal and non-fatal assertions, incorrect usage of assertions, or platform-specific issues with the test runner. Review your assertions to ensure fatal failures (`ASSERT_...`) are used when you want to abort test functions immediately and non-fatal failures (`EXPECT_...`) otherwise.

### What is the difference between fatal and non-fatal failures?
- **Fatal Failures** (`ASSERT_*`): Stop execution of the current test function immediately. Use these when continuing would cause crashes or undefined behavior.
- **Non-Fatal Failures** (`EXPECT_*`): Log the failure but allow the test to continue, providing more comprehensive diagnostics.

### Why does my death test behave differently in different environments?
Death tests rely on spawning child processes and can be sensitive to platform differences such as available threading support and forking behavior. GoogleTest supports two death test styles (`fast` and `threadsafe`). If threading affects your tests, consider switching to the `threadsafe` death test style:

```cpp
GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
```

### My tests crash, but I don’t see assertion failure messages. What’s wrong?
Crashes may occur due to unhandled fatal failures inside helper functions or misuse of assertions (such as using `ASSERT_` macros in non-void functions). Ensure that fatal assertions are only used in `void` functions or test bodies. Use `SCOPED_TRACE` or custom messages to locate the failure easily.

### Why does gMock warn about "Uninteresting function call"?
An uninteresting call is when a mock method is invoked but has no matching `EXPECT_CALL`. By default, this emits a warning as it might indicate missing expectations. If the calls are intentional, either use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for such methods.

### How to interpret messages about unsatisfied or excessive calls in mocks?
Such messages mean that your mock expectations don’t align with the actual calls:
- **Unsatisfied:** Expected calls were not made.
- **Excessive:** Calls occurred more times than allowed.

Review the matchers and cardinalities in your `EXPECT_CALL` statements to ensure they match expected behavior.

## Common Issues & Gotchas

### Assertion Misuse and Propagation
- Using `ASSERT_` macros in sub-functions only aborts that function, not the entire test. Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` or check `HasFatalFailure()` in the caller to handle this.
- Fatal assertions cannot be used in constructors or destructors.

### Death Test Pitfalls
- Death tests execute code in separate processes. Side effects in death test code are not seen by the parent process.
- Avoid freeing heap memory in death tests unless you disable heap checking.
- Multiple death assertions on the same line can cause compilation errors.

### Sequencing and Ordering Mistakes
Incorrect ordering in `EXPECT_CALL` sequences or misuse of `RetiresOnSaturation()` can cause unexpected failures.

### Mock Object Lifecycle
- Leaked mocks cause verification failures. Use `Mock::AllowLeak` if intentional.
- Verify and clear expectations early if ownership of mocks is complex.

---

## Error Messages & Debugging

### Common Failure Messages Explained
- _"Unexpected mock function call"_: A call happened that doesn't match any active expectation.
- _"Mock function called more times than expected"_: Too many calls to a mock method.
- _"Unsatisfied expectation"_: Expected call was not invoked.
- _"Uninteresting mock function call"_: A mock was called without any expectations set.

### Using --gmock_verbose for Debugging
Set the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed traces of mock expectations being set and matched. This may include argument values and stack traces, helping pinpoint mismatch sources.

### Diagnosing Test Order Issues
Use GoogleTest’s `InSequence` or `After` clauses mindfully to ensure the intended call order. Misordering is a frequent source of failures.

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Step-by-Step Approach to Debugging Test Failures
1. **Identify** whether failure is due to assertion misuse, mock expectation mismatch, or death test behavior.
2. **Check assertion types:** Confirm fatal vs non-fatal assertion usage aligns with test intent.
3. **Enable verbose mock output:** Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls.
4. **Review mock expectations:** Verify `EXPECT_CALL` matchers, cardinalities, and ordering constraints.
5. **Analyze death tests:** Ensure they use appropriate style (`fast` vs `threadsafe`) and validate exit codes and output matchers.
6. **Use `SCOPED_TRACE`:** Add trace messages around complex logic to narrow failure scopes.
7. **Verify platform environment:** Confirm compatibility of threading and process control features for death tests.
8. **Check for memory leaks or premature destruction:** If needed, call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations` explicitly.

### Verification & Recovery
- After fixing, verify that test failures decrease or disappear.
- Use `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` flags to catch flaky failures.

## Performance & Optimization related to Failures

- Overly strict mock expectations can cause fragile failures; loosen constraints using broader `Times` clauses.
- Excessive logging from mocks (`--gmock_verbose=info`) can slow tests. Use selectively.
- Death tests are inherently slower; isolate and minimize their usage.

---

## Security & Access Issues Impacting Tests

- In death tests, leaked mocks cause additional failure codes. Use `Mock::AllowLeak` to avoid false negatives.
- Ensure that mock classes have virtual destructors to prevent undefined behavior.

---

## Data & Storage Issues Related to Test Failures

- Death tests that prematurely deallocate resources can cause heap errors.
- Use default environment setup and teardown to manage shared resources carefully across tests.

---

## Getting Help & Support

- Enable debug and verbose output using flags:
  - `--gtest_break_on_failure` to stop the test run on first failure.
  - `--gmock_verbose=info` for mock diagnostics.

- Reference [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) and [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for examples and advanced troubleshooting.

- Use [Community & Support Channels](/getting-started/next-steps-and-resources/community-and-support) for reporting issues and requesting assistance.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_` macros for validations that can continue after failure, `ASSERT_` macros when continuing makes no sense.
- Set expectations on mocks before exercising tested code.
- Leverage `NiceMock` for suppressing warnings on uninteresting calls, and `StrictMock` if uninteresting calls should be treated as errors.
- Employ `RetiresOnSaturation()` with mock expectations to avoid sticky failures when call counts are exceeded.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to failures inside helper functions.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for setting mock default behaviors without enforcing call counts.
- Avoid mixing mock expectations and test logic; keep tests focused and maintainable.
