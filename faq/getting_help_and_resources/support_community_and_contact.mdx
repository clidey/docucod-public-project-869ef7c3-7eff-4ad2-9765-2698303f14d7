# Where can I get support or join the community?

This page helps you find the right support channels, community forums, and ways to contribute to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you are seeking peer assistance, reporting issues, or wanting to stay engaged with the development, you will find guidance here.

## Support Channels

### GitHub Repository
- **Primary Source & Issue Tracker:**
  The official GitHub repository for [GoogleTest and GoogleMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) is your main destination for:
  - Reporting bugs and feature requests via the _Issues_ tab.
  - Browsing source code, documentation, and examples.
  - Accessing releases and changelogs.

### Mailing Lists and Official Channels
- Google does not provide official mailing lists for GoogleTest or GoogleMock support.
- For official announcements and updates, monitor the GitHub repository's release notes and commits.

### Stack Overflow
- A rich community exists on Stack Overflow where you can ask questions and find answers tagged with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`googlemock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googlemock).
- When posting questions, be sure to include clear code snippets and error messages for better assistance.

## Community Forums and Discussion

### Google Group or Slack Channels
- No official GoogleGroup or Slack workspace dedicated to GoogleTest/GoogleMock exists.
