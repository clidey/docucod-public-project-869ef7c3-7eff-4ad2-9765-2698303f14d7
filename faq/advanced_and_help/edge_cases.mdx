# Advanced and Edge-Case Troubleshooting

Guidance for resolving obscure failures and mastering complex mock/test configurations in GoogleMock and GoogleTest. This page equips you with insights and actionable techniques to debug rare but critical issues you may face in advanced testing scenarios.

---

## 1. Understanding Common Advanced Failure Scenarios

Even seasoned users encounter confusing failures during complex mock configurations. Recognizing the nature of these failures leads to faster, more effective troubleshooting.

### Typical Advanced Failures

- **Unexpected Calls:** Occurs when a mock method is called with arguments that do not match any active `EXPECT_CALL`. GoogleMock will report these with detailed explanations about mismatched arguments and unmet prerequisites.

- **Excessive Calls:** When a mock method is called more times than declared in its `Times()` clause, GoogleMock signals an upper-bound violation, explaining call counts and expectations.

- **Unsatisfied Expectations:** Mock objects verify at destruction (or on explicit verification) whether all expectations have been met. Missing calls or incomplete use of `WillOnce` actions cause failures.

- **Mismatch of Arguments and Matchers:** When arguments do not satisfy the expectations' matchers or `.With()` multi-argument matcher, calls are rejected, with verbose diagnostics.

- **Retired Expectations:** Expectations with `RetiresOnSaturation()` get deactivated after saturation; any subsequent matching call may fail because that expectation is no longer active.

- **Leaked Mocks:** Mocks not deleted at test exit lead to unverified expectations, which GoogleMock reports as potential test bugs.

## 2. Strategic Debugging Workflow

Hereâ€™s a systematic approach to address advanced and obscure issues in gMock tests:

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Failure Output Carefully">
Start by reading the failure message output in full detail. GoogleMock reports argument mismatches, call counts, sequences, and file/line locations of expectations.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Verbose Logging">
Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed tracing of expectations and mock calls, including matched expectations and stack traces. This reveals why calls are accepted or rejected.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Expectation Setup Timing">
Ensure all `EXPECT_CALL()` and `ON_CALL()` statements occur before exercising the code under test. Setting expectations after calls leads to undefined behavior and hard-to-debug failures.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Call Argument Matchers">
Review predicates and matchers in all `EXPECT_CALL()`s to confirm they align with the actual arguments being passed. Use matchers like `_`, `Eq()`, or customized predicates judiciously.
</Step>
<Step title="Inspect Expectation Order and Sequences">
Use `InSequence` and `After` clauses prudently to verify call order constraints. Remember that sequences retire expectations as calls pass.
</Step>
<Step title="Handle Retired Expectations Properly">
Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` when multiple expectations overlap on similar calls. This avoids unexpected matchings with stale expectations.
</Step>
<Step title="Force Early Verification When Needed">
If mocks are allocated on the heap or may leak, invoke `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(mock_ptr)` explicitly in tests to catch issues early.
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor for Leaked Mocks">
If GoogleMock reports leaks, ensure all mock objects are properly destroyed or suppress warnings intentionally using `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_ptr)`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Pitfall: Over-Specifying Expectations

Too-strict expectations on arguments or call order lead to brittle tests that break on innocuous changes. Use broad matchers or scoped expectations to make tests robust.

### Best Practice: Use `ON_CALL()` for Default Behavior

Prefer `ON_CALL()` to define baseline responses for mock methods without enforcing call counts. Reserve `EXPECT_CALL()` for behavior verification.

### Pitfall: Ignoring the Sticky Nature of Expectations

Expectations remain active after being saturated unless explicitly retired. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to prevent oversaturation errors.

### Best Practice: Leverage Sequences for Ordering

Group ordered calls under `InSequence` blocks to clearly express call order constraints and avoid ambiguity.

### Pitfall: Mismatched Matchers and Argument Types

Ensure matchers' static types and semantics suit the arguments passed. Use `SafeMatcherCast` if necessary for safe conversions.

### Best Practice: Use Verbose Mode to Gain Insights

Running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` exposes expectation matching dynamics and explains failures, accelerating diagnosis.

## 4. Troubleshooting Specific Error Messages

<AccordionGroup title="Error Messages Explained">
<Accordion title="Unexpected mock function call">
A call was made that does not satisfy any active `EXPECT_CALL`.

**How to fix:**
- Validate argument matchers.
- Add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` if allowed.
- Check sequencing and pre-requisites that block calls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock function called more times than expected">
The call frequency exceeded limits set by `Times()`.

**How to fix:**
- Adjust call expectations or use `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after use.
- Check test logic for unintended extra calls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting mock function call">
A mock method was called without matching any `EXPECT_CALL`.

**How to fix:**
- Add `EXPECT_CALL` if you want to verify calls.
- Otherwise, ignore or suppress warnings with `NiceMock`.
- Define sensible default actions with `ON_CALL`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Leaked mock objects detected">
Mocks were not deleted before test ends.

**How to fix:**
- Ensure mocks go out of scope or are deleted.
- Use smart pointers if possible.
- Suppress with `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional (not recommended).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mismatched arguments">
Arguments in call don't match `EXPECT_CALL` patterns.

**How to fix:**
- Use suitable matchers.
- Utilize `.With()` for multi-argument constraints.
- Use verbose output to see matcher details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsatisfied prerequisites">
Call order dependencies specified by `.After` or sequences are unmet.

**How to fix:**
- Check that pre-requisite calls occur before the dependent call.
- Verify sequence construction and correctness.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Advanced Mock Configuration Tips

### Delegating Calls

- Use delegation to fakes, real objects, or parent implementations to emulate partial mocking.
- Delegate default actions with `ON_CALL` using lambdas invoking real implementations.

### Handling Move-Only Types

- Mock methods with move-only parameters or returns using `MOCK_METHOD` as usual.
- Use lambdas in `WillOnce` or `WillRepeatedly` to create and return fresh move-only objects.

### Custom Matchers and Actions

- Write custom matchers using the `MATCHER` macros for tailored argument matching.
- Define new actions with lambdas or implementing `ActionInterface` for precise control over mock behaviors.

### Managing Strictness

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress noisy warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock` to fail on any unexpected calls, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

### Testing Asynchronous Behavior

- Use actions combined with synchronization primitives (e.g. notifications) to coordinate asynchronous calls deterministically.

### Verifying Mocks Early

- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` for on-demand checking.
- Avoid setting new expectations after verification.

## 6. Practical Debugging Example

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::Expectation;

class MockService {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int x), ());
};

void TestCompute() {
  NiceMock<MockService> mock_service;

  // Default action
  ON_CALL(mock_service, Compute(_)).WillByDefault(Return(0));

  // Expect Compute(42) exactly twice
  Expectation e = EXPECT_CALL(mock_service, Compute(42)).Times(2);

  // Test runner calls
  mock_service.Compute(42);  // OK
  mock_service.Compute(100); // OK, default action
  mock_service.Compute(42);  // OK

  // Third call - unexpected: triggers failure
  mock_service.Compute(42);  // Fails
}
```

Run with `--gmock_verbose=info` to observe why the last call fails, check that the two `EXPECT_CALL`s were matched first, and the third call exceeds `Times(2)`.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting and Recovery

- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` combined with `--gtest_stack_trace_depth` to control diagnostic output.
- Consider temporarily switching to `NiceMock` to isolate warnings.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL(...).RetiresOnSaturation()` where sequences or numeric limits cause problems with sticky expectations.
- Add checkpoints with `MockFunction` and sequences to correlate calls to test phases.
- Clear expectations explicitly with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` between phases if needed.

<Tip>
When facing complex mock failures, enabling `--gmock_verbose=info` is your best friend. It reveals the internal matching process of calls to expectations, showing why a call was accepted, rejected, or treated as unexpected.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid setting expectations after the code under test exercises the mock. Doing so may cause undefined behavior and make failures cryptic.
</Warning>

<Check>
Periodically clean up mocks by verifying and clearing expectations with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to detect early leaks or unsatisfied conditions.
</Check>
