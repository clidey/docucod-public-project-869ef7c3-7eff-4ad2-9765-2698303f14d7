- **Google Groups and Mailing Lists:** Often used for announcements and community discussions.

## Bug Reporting and Contribution

If you encounter a bug or want to contribute improvements:

- Search the GitHub issues to verify if the issue is already reported or fixed in recent commits.
- When reporting bugs, provide minimal reproducible examples and clear descriptions.
- Follow repository contribution guidelines for submitting patches or enhancements.

## Support Contacts and Escalation

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open source projects maintained by Google. There is no official paid support, but:

- The main support channel is through GitHub issues and community forums.
- For enterprise-level test infrastructure support, consider commercial services or internal expertise integrating GoogleTest.

## Practical Tips for Getting Help

- **Start with Official Documentation:** Many common questions and troubleshooting guidance are already answered.
- **Use Verbosity Flags:** Running your test suite with `--gmock_verbose=info` reveals detailed traces of mock calls helping diagnosis.
- **Collect Logs and Minimal Tests:** When filing bugs or asking for help, include concise reproducing examples.
- **Avoid Over-Specifying Mocks:** Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior and only `EXPECT_CALL` for essential verification to minimize false alarms.
