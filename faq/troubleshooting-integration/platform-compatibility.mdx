# Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

Ensure your development and testing environment is compatible with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide details supported platforms, compiler requirements, the C++ standard baseline, and how to address common incompatibilities. It also provides practical guidance on verifying platform support and where to find the most current compatibility information.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a minimum of C++17 support across your compiler toolchain. They officially support a wide variety of platforms in alignment with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and maintain an evolving compatibility matrix on GitHub. Supported platforms include major desktop and server operating systems such as Linux distributions, Windows (desktop and variants), and Mac OS, along with several less common or embedded platforms.


## Supported Platforms

- **Desktop & Server OSes:** Linux, Windows Desktop (including MinGW), macOS.
- **Mobile & Embedded OSes:** iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, Windows RT, and limited embedded systems.
- **Some UNIX Flavors:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, QNX, etc.

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest supports these compilers with respective minimum versions:

- **GCC:** Version 7.0 or newer (to ensure robust C++17 support)
- **Clang:** Recent stable versions supporting C++17 fully
- **MSVC:** Visual C++ 2017 Update 3 or later (VS 2017 version 15.3+) is required
- **IntelLLVM:** Supported with C++17 compliance

The MSVC compiler must be at least version 19.00 (Visual C++ 2015) to build GoogleMock successfully.

## Minimum C++ Standard Requirement

C++17 is the minimum required standard to compile and use GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. To ensure compliance:

- In CMake, specify:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If not using CMake or another build system, pass the appropriate compiler flags manually (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).

## How GoogleTest Detects the Platform and Environment

GoogleTest and GoogleMock use internal environment-detection macros to identify operating system, compiler, threading support, and other platform features. This detection enables:

- Enabling/disabling platform-specific optimizations
- Selecting appropriate synchronization primitives
- Configuring regex and other utility use

These macros cover over 30 platforms, including desktop, mobile, embedded, and various UNIX systems. The detection happens automatically but can be overridden by defining certain macros at build time.

## Common Issues and How to Resolve Them

### 1. Compiler Version Too Old
- **Problem:** Compilation errors or C++17 features unavailable.
- **Solution:** Upgrade your compiler to meet the minimum version requirements. MSVC users must use Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later.

### 2. C++ Standard Not Set or Incorrect
- **Problem:** You see errors indicating unsupported language features.
- **Solution:** Explicitly set the C++ standard to C++17 or higher using your build system.

### 3. Missing or Misconfigured Thread Support
- **Problem:** GoogleTest is not thread-safe or has linking errors related to pthread.
- **Solution:** Enable pthread support with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if your platform supports it. With CMake, this detection is automatic.

### 4. Windows Runtime Environment Variants
- **Problem:** Building for Windows RT, Phone, or UWP causes incompatibilities.
- **Solution:** Verify your target environment and adjust project settings accordingly. Some Windows variants have restricted API surfaces impacting GoogleTest support.

### 5. Stream Redirection Support
- Not all embedded or mobile environments support IO stream redirection, needed for some features like death tests.
- Confirm that your environment supports it or disable features relying on stream redirection if necessary.

## Verifying Platform Compatibility

You can check macro definitions within your build to verify which platform GoogleTest detects. For example, inspect `GTEST_OS_*` macros (like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`) defined during compilation. Logging the values of these macros can help confirm platform detection.

GoogleTest also defines macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` and `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` to indicate threading support.

## Practical Tips for Success

- Always use at least C++17 when configuring your build system.
- Use the official CMake build scripts provided by GoogleTest to ease configuration across platforms.
- For Windows builds, be mindful of runtime library linkageâ€”use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align runtimes.
- On Linux and macOS, ensure pthread is available and linked to support thread-safe tests.
- If using embedded or less common platforms, verify that macros for key features like filesystem and threading are properly defined.

## Example: Setting C++17 Standard in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTestProject CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_subdirectory(googletest)  # adding GoogleTest as a subproject

add_executable(my_test my_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest gtest_main pthread)
```

## Helpful Macros for Manual Overrides

In some cases, you may forcibly enable or disable features if the automated detection is incorrect.

- To enable pthreads support manually:
  ```
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
  ```

- To disable streams redirection if unsupported:
  ```
  -DGTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION=0
  ```

- To build Google Mock on MSVC, ensure compiler version is Visual Studio 2015 or newer, otherwise compilation will error out.

## Troubleshooting Compatibility

If you encounter issues:

- Verify compiler version and flags.
- Confirm platform macro detections by printing `GTEST_OS_*` macros.
- Check if your platform supports C++17 fully and if your standard library is compliant.
- Review the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) for known platform-specific issues.
- Confirm that the build system invokes the compiler with the correct runtime linkage options, especially on Windows.
