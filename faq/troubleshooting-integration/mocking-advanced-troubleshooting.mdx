# Advanced Mocking Troubleshooting

This page addresses subtle failure modes and common points of confusion when working with GoogleMock (gMock). It guides you through understanding strictness levels, handling warnings about uninteresting mock calls, managing expectation setup, and diagnosing complex mocks with overlapping or mismatched expectations. By mastering these concepts, you'll refine your mocks for robustness and clarity.

## Understanding Mock Strictness: NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock

GoogleMock provides three principal wrappers to control how mocks handle uninteresting calls—calls to mock methods without explicit expectations:

- **`NiceMock<T>`**: Suppresses warnings about uninteresting calls, letting tests run quietly without noise from unconfigured methods.
- **`NaggyMock<T>` (default)**: Prints warnings on uninteresting calls but allows them to proceed.
- **`StrictMock<T>`**: Treats uninteresting calls as errors, failing the test immediately.

### When to Use Each

- Use `NiceMock` when you don’t want warnings and are confident uninteresting calls are acceptable.
- Use `NaggyMock` (or raw mocks) for diagnosing unexpected interaction in development.
- Use `StrictMock` to enforce tight contract adherence and catch unexpected calls early.

### Example Usage

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

// Suppress warnings for uninteresting calls
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;

// Default (naggy) shows warnings
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_mock;

// Enforces strict checking, fails on any uninteresting call
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
```

> Note that these modifiers only affect *uninteresting calls* (methods without expectations). Calls that explicitly violate expectations remain errors in all modes.

## Handling "Uninteresting Mock Function Call" Warnings

When a mock method is called but has no matching `EXPECT_CALL`, gMock will issue a warning about an uninteresting call. This message:

- **Is informational**, not a failure.
- Indicates your test does not expect or validate this method call.

### How to Manage This Situation

- Add an `EXPECT_CALL` if you want to verify the call.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior without adding expectations.
- Wrap the mock in `NiceMock` to suppress these warnings when you intentionally don't verify all calls.
- To disable individual warnings without maintaining cumbersome `EXPECT_CALL`s, prefer `NiceMock` or use `.Times(AnyNumber())` on specific calls.

### Why Warnings Are Useful

These warnings help catch unintended method calls that might indicate missing test expectations or logical errors.

---

## Setting Up Expectations Correctly

### `EXPECT_CALL` Must Precede Use

Always set mock expectations *before* the mock methods are invoked. Otherwise, behavior is undefined and may result in confusing failures or silent issues.

### Multiple Expectations and Overlapping Matchers

- GoogleMock matches expectations in **reverse order of definition**: newer overrides older.
- When multiple `EXPECT_CALL`s apply, the last defined matching call takes precedence.
- To avoid unexpected shadowing, place broader or default expectations first and more specific expectations after.

### Using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to Prevent Sticky Expectations

By default, expectations remain active even when saturated (called the maximum number of allowed times). Using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` tells gMock to consider the expectation inactive once saturated, allowing earlier expectations to match subsequent calls.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething(1)).Times(2).RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```
In this example, after two calls with argument `1`, subsequent calls match the catch-all expectation.

### Sequencing Calls

Use `InSequence` or `After` to enforce call order and avoid confusion over call ordering that may appear as errors.

```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

## Diagnosing Common Mocking Troubles

### Unexpected Call Errors

Indicate that a method was called, but failed to match any active expectation.

**How to debug:**

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed call matching logs.
- Check the arguments passed and compare with expectations.
- Verify sequencing and cardinality constraints.

### Excessive Calls

Occurs when a function is called more times than expected.

**Solutions:**

- Fix the test or production code to not call too many times.
- Relax expectations by increasing the allowed call count or using `Times(AnyNumber())` where appropriate.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky expectations causing repetitive matching.

### Mismatched Arguments

A call fails because passed arguments do not match the expected matchers.

**Tips:**

- Use simpler matchers (like `_`) if precise matching isn’t necessary.
- Use `With` clause to write predicates matching multiple arguments at once.
- Remember argument types and const-qualifiers must align.

### Expectation Ordering Failures

When using `InSequence` or `After`, calls outside the specified order cause errors.

**Tips:**

- Verify the expected sequences.
- Use multiple sequences for complex partial orders.

## Best Practices for Refining Complex Mocks

- **Start with `NiceMock` for early-stage tests:** Avoid noise from uninteresting calls.
- **Incrementally add `EXPECT_CALL`s:** Only specify strict expectations when needed.
- **Leverage default behaviors with `ON_CALL`:** Provides defaults without imposing call count constraints.
- **Use sequences to enforce order:** Prevents ambiguity when interaction order matters.
- **Retire saturated expectations:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid stale expectation matching.
- **Run with verbose mode when debugging:** Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain insights into call matching and failures.
