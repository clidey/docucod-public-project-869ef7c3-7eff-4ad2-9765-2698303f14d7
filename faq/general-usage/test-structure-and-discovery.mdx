# Test Structure and Discovery

GoogleTest organizes, discovers, and executes tests using a structured approach that aligns with your code's logical organization. This page clarifies how to name test suites, how to arrange your test files, and how GoogleTest efficiently manages large collections of tests to help you maintain scalable and readable test projects.

---

## Understanding Test Organization

GoogleTest uses two main organizational units for tests: **test suites** and **tests**. Each test suite groups related individual tests that generally target the same code module or related functionality.

- **Test Suite**: A named grouping of related tests (think of it as a container for logically connected tests). Each suite corresponds to the *first argument* of GoogleTest macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()`.
- **Test**: An individual unit test inside a suite, identified by the *second argument* of the macros.

### Naming Conventions and Structure

- Both test suite names and test names must be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.
- A test's full name consists of its suite name and individual test name, e.g., `MathTest.Addition`.
- Tests in different suites can share the same individual name; the test suite namespace keeps them distinct.

<Info>
Keeping your test suites and tests named and organized clearly will vastly improve maintainability and readability.

## File and Directory Layout

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests based on the test binaries you build and runâ€”test discovery is not done via scanning file names or directories as in other frameworks. Still, good file organization helps:

- **Tests should be grouped by related code modules**, preferably in dedicated subdirectories or with file names that reflect their purpose.
- **Each test source file typically contains multiple related tests** and in many cases one or more test suites.
- Naming test files using a consistent suffix, such as `_test.cc`, helps distinguish them from production code.

<Note>
GoogleTest does not require special file or directory naming for discovering tests; it discovers tests from the registered test suites compiled into your binary.
</Note>

## Test Creation Macros and Discovery Flow

GoogleTest provides several macros for defining tests, which encapsulate suite and test naming along with fixture support:

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`: Defines a test without fixture support.
- `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`: Defines a test that uses the `TestFixtureName` fixture. Here, the test suite name equals the fixture name.
- `TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`: Defines a value-parameterized test.

### How GoogleTest Discovers Tests

1. **Registration at Compile-Time**: Each test defined with these macros is automatically registered in a global test registry.
2. **Execution of Tests**: At runtime, `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` invokes all discovered tests by iterating over registered test suites and tests.
3. **Filtering**: You can filter which tests to run using the `--gtest_filter=` flag, specifying wildcards matching suite and test names.

<Tip>
Use the `TEST_F` macro to reuse setup and teardown code across multiple tests, reducing duplication.
</Tip>

## Managing Large and Complex Test Collections

When your project grows, managing test suite scope, test running time, and organization becomes critical.

### Efficient Naming and Grouping

- Create **focused test suites** that cover specific components.
- Avoid excessively large test suites with hundreds of unrelated tests; instead, split them logically.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

Use value-parameterized (`TEST_P`) and typed tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE`) to write concise tests that cover multiple data sets or types without duplicating test code. This keeps your test codebase compact and scalable.

### Filtering and Selective Execution

Run subsets of tests by:
- Filtering suites and tests through `--gtest_filter=`.
- Running disabled tests using flags.

This lets you focus on parts of the codebase during development or CI without excessive overhead.

<Tip>
Parameterize your tests to reduce redundancy and make it easier to expand coverage with additional data cases.
</Tip>

## Test Suite Lifecycle Overview

Each test suite follows a lifecycle that GoogleTest manages:

- **Setup**: Shared setup method `SetUpTestSuite()` is called once before any tests run in a suite.
- **Test Execution**: Individual tests run separately, each with their own setup `SetUp()` and teardown `TearDown()` methods.
- **Teardown**: Shared teardown method `TearDownTestSuite()` is called once after all tests in the suite.

You can override these lifecycle hooks in your test fixture classes to initialize and clean up shared resources.

## Practical Examples

### Basic Test Example
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

### Fixture-Based Test Example
```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup code
  }
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, ExampleTest1) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(SomeFunction());
}
```

### Parameterized Test Example
```cpp
class ParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(ParamTest, IsEven) {
  int val = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(val % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, ParamTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

## Best Practices for Test Structure

- Use **test fixtures** (`TEST_F`) for tests sharing common setup and teardown logic.
- Choose descriptive names for test suites and tests without underscores for clarity.
- Utilize parameterized tests to minimize code duplication when varying test inputs.
- Organize your tests in files matching related code for easy navigation.

## Troubleshooting Common Test Discovery and Execution Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Test Suite Naming and Discovery FAQs">
<Accordion title="Why must test suite and test names avoid underscores?">
GoogleTest requires test suite and test names to be valid C++ identifiers without underscores to avoid parsing issues and maintain clear naming conventions that correlate to C++ naming.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does GoogleTest discover tests?">
GoogleTest discovers tests via compile-time registration when the test macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc.) are used. It does *not* rely on file naming but on registered suites in the test binary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I organize tests in multiple files?">
Yes, tests can be spread across many source files. Once compiled and linked into the test binary, all registered tests are discoverable and runnable.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I run a subset of tests?">
Use the `--gtest_filter=` flag with wildcard patterns to specify which tests or suites to run. For example, `--gtest_filter=MathTest.*` runs all tests in `MathTest`.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If you see tests not running, ensure that your test source files are included and linked into your test target, and that the tests are registered (i.e., use `TEST`, `TEST_F`, or parameterized equivalents).
</Tip>

## Summary

Organizing tests with well-named suites and tests, structuring test files logically, and leveraging parameterized tests help keep GoogleTest projects scalable and maintainable. Understanding the automatic discovery mechanism and lifecycle management empowers developers to write efficient and robust test programs.
