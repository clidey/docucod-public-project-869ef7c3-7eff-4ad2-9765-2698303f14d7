## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I install GoogleTest and GoogleMock in my development environment?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock can be installed using various build systems. The most common setups are with **CMake** and **Bazel**:

- **CMake:** Follow the installation instructions in the [Install with CMake](../../getting-started/installation-quickstart/install-cmake.md) guide. It explains how to fetch GoogleTest as a dependency and link it with your project.
- **Bazel:** The [Install with Bazel](../../getting-started/installation-quickstart/install-bazel.md) guide walks you through workspace setup and BUILD file configuration for GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

Once installed, you can include the headers `<gmock/gmock.h>` and `<gtest/gtest.h>` in your tests.


### What are the basic steps to set up and write tests using GoogleMock?

1. **Include headers** for GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

    ```cpp
    #include <gmock/gmock.h>
    #include <gtest/gtest.h>
    ```

2. **Define mock classes** using `MOCK_METHOD` macros to mock interfaces or classes:

    ```cpp
    class MockFoo : public Foo {
    public:
      MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
      MOCK_METHOD(bool, Process, (int count), (override));
    };
    ```

3. **In your test**:

    - Create mock objects.
    - Set default behaviors with `ON_CALL`.
    - Set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`.
    - Exercise your code.

    ```cpp
    TEST(FooTest, Example) {
      MockFoo mock;
      ON_CALL(mock, GetSize()).WillByDefault(::testing::Return(10));
      EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(5)).Times(1);
      ... run code using mock ...
    }
    ```

4. **Verify** is automatic when the mock is destroyed.

For more detailed workflow including examples, see [Using Mock Objects Effectively](../../guides/writing-and-running-tests/using-mock-objects.md).


### What are assertions and how do I use them?

Assertions verify expected outcomes in your tests. GoogleTest provides two main types:

- `EXPECT_` macros: Non-fatal failures; the test continues after failure.
- `ASSERT_` macros: Fatal failures; the test aborts after failure.

GoogleMock adds matchers and special assertions to check mock interactions. For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(::testing::Eq(5)));
EXPECT_THAT(value, ::testing::Ge(10));
```

Explore more about assertions and matchers in the [Assertions Reference](../../api-reference/core-apis/assertions.md) and [Matchers Reference](../../api-reference/core-apis/matchers.md).


### How does GoogleTest discover and run my test cases?

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests defined with `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros by scanning registration data generated at compile time. Then, running the test binary or using the test runner executes all registered tests.

You can filter tests by name via command line, for instance:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest
```

You don't need to write a main function if you link against `gmock_main`, which provides `main()` that initializes and runs tests for you.

Learn more about test discovery and running in the [GoogleTest Primer](../../overview/introduction-value/what-is-googletest.md) and sample test guides.


### What are parameterized tests and why should I use them?

Parameterized tests allow you to run the same logic with different input values, avoiding code duplication and improving coverage.

You define a test fixture templated on input values and instantiate tests with varied parameters.

Example snippet:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, HandlesValues) {
  int param = GetParam();
  ... test using param ...
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyInstantiation, MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

Parameterized and typed tests help cover more scenarios efficiently. See [Mastering Parameterized and Typed Tests](../../guides/test-design-and-best-practices/parameterized-tests.md) for comprehensive guidance.


### How do I integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock into my Bazel or CMake project?

- **CMake:** Use the instructions at [Install with CMake](../../getting-started/installation-quickstart/install-cmake.md) to fetch and link GoogleTest.

- **Bazel:** Follow [Install with Bazel](../../getting-started/installation-quickstart/install-bazel.md) to declare dependencies and test targets.

These pages include example workspace files, BUILD files, and CMakeLists.txt snippets. They also cover common pitfalls and tips on linking and runtime setup.


### How can I suppress warnings about uninteresting calls on mock methods?

By default, GoogleMock issues warnings if a mock method is called without an `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` to define behavior.

To suppress these:

- Use `NiceMock<T>` instead of `T` when creating your mock object.
- Or explicitly add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(::testing::AnyNumber())`.

This allows uninteresting calls without warnings, reducing noise during development.

See [The Nice, the Strict, and the Naggy](../../docs/gmock_cook_book.md#NiceStrictNaggy) in the Cookbook for detailed strategies.

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Always ensure the **mocked methods are declared virtual** (unless you use the high-performance dependency injection technique).
- Put all `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the **public section** of the mock class, even if mocking private or protected base methods.
- When mocking methods with **comma-containing arguments**, either wrap the entire argument type in parentheses or use a type alias.
- Use `ON_CALL` for setting default behavior when you do not want to verify calls.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to both specify behavior and verify the method call.
- Sequence your expectations using `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects for ordered call expectations.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to allow expectations to retire and avoid conflicts with other expectations.


---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Uninteresting Mock Function Call Warning:** Indicates no `EXPECT_CALL` for a method that was called. Use `NiceMock` or add an explicit expectation if expected.
- **Unexpected Call:** Occurs if `EXPECT_CALL` exists but the call does not match any expectation's argument matchers. Verify matchers and call arguments.
- **Mock Method Not Called:** Check if your test code actually exercises the mock method. Ensure `EXPECT_CALL` is set before the code is run.
- **Compilation Errors on MOCK_METHOD:** Confirm mock methods are virtual and properly declared. Check syntax for complex argument types.
- **Linker Errors:** Ensure GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are linked properly.

Refer to [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../getting-started/validation-troubleshooting/common-issues.md) for detailed guidance.
