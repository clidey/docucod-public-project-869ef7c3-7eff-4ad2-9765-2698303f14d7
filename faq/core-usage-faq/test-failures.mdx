# Debugging Test Failures

Understanding and resolving test failures efficiently is crucial for maintaining a reliable and robust codebase when using GoogleTest. This guide walks you through common test failure scenarios, interpreting failure outputs, managing flaky tests, and troubleshooting death tests and environment issues.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Failure Output

When a GoogleTest run reports failures, the output provides valuable clues about what went wrong. Familiarize yourself with the following elements to quickly pinpoint issues:

- **Test Suite and Test Name**: Failures are listed by their test suite and test name, e.g., `FatalFailureTest.FatalFailureInSubroutine`.
- **Failure Location**: Each failure message shows the source file and line number where the test assertion failed.
- **Expected vs Actual Values**: Assertions like `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_EQ` print out the expected and actual values with helpful explanations.
- **Stack Traces**: Detailed call stacks may be printed, indicating where the failure originated and how the program arrived there.
- **Google Test Traces**: If you use `SCOPED_TRACE`, trace points are included to highlight the call paths in repeated or nested calls.

### Example Failure Output

```none
/path/to/test_file.cc:123: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  foo
    Which is: 1
  bar
    Which is: 2
Stack trace:
 ...
```

### Tips

- Use the **file and line number** to navigate directly to the failing assertion.
- Review the **expected vs actual values** carefully; this often reveals test logic or implementation mistakes.
- Check any **Google Test trace points** to understand the context, especially inside helper functions or loops.

## 2. Common Failure Scenarios and What They Mean

### Assertion Failures

These occur when an assertion fails, such as `EXPECT_EQ(a, b)` when `a` does not equal `b`. GoogleTest outputs the evaluated values aiding diagnosis.

### Test Fixture Misuse

Failures can occur if tests within the same test suite use different test fixtures. GoogleTest enforces that all tests in a suite use the same fixture class. Example error:

```none
All tests in the same test suite must use the same test fixture
class...
```

**How to fix:** Ensure all tests in a suite use the same fixture or split them into separate suites.

### Death Test Failures

Death tests verify that code crashes (or exits) as expected. These tests run in child processes. Common issues include:

- Failure to match expected output pattern.
- Death test hangs caused by multithreading or improper setup.

Refer to the death test best practices on naming your death test suites `*DeathTest` for correct sequencing.

---

## 3. Diagnosing and Fixing Death Test Failures

Death tests are special: the tested code runs in a child process and is expected to terminate abnormally.

### Common causes of death test failures:

- Exit code or signal did not match predicate.
- Stderr output did not match the expected regex or matcher.
- Death test statement returned normally without terminating.
- Flaky behavior due to environment or threading issues.

### Best Practices:

- Name the death test **suite** with a suffix `DeathTest` (e.g., `MyClassDeathTest`).
- Avoid spawning threads in the parent process before death tests run.
- If using mocks inside death tests, place `EXPECT_CALL` inside the `EXPECT_DEATH` macro.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Check the **expected exit code and output regex** in the death assertion macros.
2. Confirm you are using the appropriate **death test style** (`fast` vs. `threadsafe`).
3. Avoid **non-terminated** statements or unexpected exceptions inside death tests.
4. Run tests with increased verbosity or add logging inside the death test to observe behavior.

## 4. Isolating Environment-Related Test Failures

Sometimes tests fail or behave inconsistently due to issues in the test environment setup or teardown.

### Signs of environment-related failures:

- Tests are skipped unexpectedly.
- Setup or teardown functions fail.
- Tests have hidden dependencies causing flaky behavior.

### Strategies:

- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for shared resource management and confirm these methods succeed.
- Implement and register global environments via `testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` carefully.
- Check logs for environment failure diagnostic messages.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` pragmatically in setup methods when pre-conditions are not met.

### Troubleshooting:

- Run tests singularly or in isolation to identify flaky interactions.
- Validate environment initialization order and dependencies.
- Track and log the lifecycle calls explicitly.

---

## 5. Managing Flaky Tests

Flaky tests intermittently pass or fail and can be caused by timing, concurrency, or environment issues.

### Techniques to manage flaky tests:

- Use the `--gtest_repeat` flag to run tests multiple times and identify flakiness.

- Enable `--gtest_shuffle` to run tests in random order, exposing hidden dependencies.

- Increase logging detail in tests and mocks (e.g., use gMock verbosity flags).

- Instrument synchronization points and state to determine races or races conditions.

### Tips

- Flaky death tests may benefit from the `threadsafe` death test style.
- Utilize `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to failures inside loops or helper functions.

---

## 6. Using Verbose Logging and Traces for Diagnosis

GoogleMock supports verbosity flags to provide detailed interaction logs useful for diagnosing expectation mismatches.

- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` or `--gmock_verbose=tinfo` to see detailed call and expectation information.

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` in test helpers to annotate failure contexts.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, Examples) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("Iteration 2");
  EXPECT_EQ(ComputeValue(2), 42);
}
```

This marks all failures inside the scope with the trace message, aiding quick identification.

---

## 7. Best Practices for Effective Debugging

- **Confirm test fixture consistency**: all tests in a suite must share the same fixture.

- **Avoid non-void functions containing fatal assertions**: fatal failures only abort the current function, which may lead to unexpected behaviors.

- **Use `HasFatalFailure()` in subroutines** to detect failures and abort early.

- **Isolate death tests in dedicated suites** for correct ordering and avoidance of thread conflicts.

- **Use `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` macros** in tests of test utilities, helping to validate failure handling code.

- **Keep test environment setup robust and deterministic** to minimize flaky test occurrences.

| Symptom                                | Checkpoint / Fix                                      |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Test fails without clear failure site | Review failure message and stack trace               |
| Death test fails or hangs              | Review death test style and avoid threads before death test |
| Tests skipped unexpectedly             | Check `GTEST_SKIP()` calls and environment setup      |
| Tests flaky under repeated runs       | Use repeat and shuffle flags; analyze shared state     |
| Mixed test fixtures in one suite      | Ensure fixture class uniformity or split suites        |
| Failure messages hard to interpret    | Use `SCOPED_TRACE` and verbose gMock logging          |
