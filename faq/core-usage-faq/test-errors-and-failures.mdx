# Interpreting Test Errors and Failures

This page helps you understand the most frequent error messages, test failures, and runtime issues you will encounter when using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses on actionable insights to diagnose and resolve problems related to misconfigured mocks, expectation mismatches, assertion failures, and call order conflicts.

## 1. Common Error Types and What They Mean

### a. Expectation Not Satisfied

**Description:**

Your test sets an expectation using `EXPECT_CALL` that a mock method should be called a certain number of times or with specific arguments, but this does not occur.

**Typical Message:**

```
Actual function call count doesn't match this expectation:
Expected: to be called once
Actual: never called - unsatisfied and active
```

**Common Causes:**

- The tested code never invokes the mock method as expected.
- The arguments provided in the call do not match the matchers in the expectation.
- Order constraints (`InSequence` or `After`) prevent the call from matching yet.

**How to Fix:**

- Verify the code under test is exercising the mock method.
- Use argument matchers (`_`, `Eq()`, `Ge()`, etc.) carefully to avoid over-specification.
- Run the test with `--gmock_verbose=info` to view detailed mock call traces.
- Check for ordering rules that may block the call from matching.

---

### b. Unexpected Mock Function Call

**Description:**

A mock method is called, but none of the defined `EXPECT_CALL` statements match the call's arguments or state.

**Typical Message:**

```
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
Function call: DoB(2)
Google Mock tried the following 1 expectation, but it didn't match:
Expected arg #0: is equal to 1
Actual: 2
Expected: to be called once
Actual: called once - saturated and active
```

**Common Causes:**

- Missing an `EXPECT_CALL` statement for the call you expect.
- Calling the mock method with unexpected arguments.
- Calls exceeding `Times()` limits.

**How to Fix:**

- Add or extend `EXPECT_CALL` statements to cover expected argument ranges.
- Double-check that the call arguments match your matchers.
- Consider adding a catch-all expectation like `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` if appropriate.

---

### c. Excessive Calls

**Description:**

The mock function is called more times than the allowed limit set by `Times()` in an expectation.

**Typical Message:**

```
Mock function "DoA Method" called more times than expected - returning directly.
Function call: DoA(9)
Expected: to be never called
Actual: called once - over-saturated and active
```

**Common Causes:**

- Your code triggers more calls than declared in the expectation cardinality.
- Forgetting to use `.Times(AnyNumber())` on expectations when multiple calls are acceptable.

**How to Fix:**

- Adjust `Times()` clauses to accurately reflect expected call counts.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to allow multiple saturated expectations to retire gracefully.

---

### d. Uninteresting Calls

**Description:**

A mock method without any `EXPECT_CALL` is invoked. By default, this triggers a warning but not a test failure.

**Typical Message:**

```
GMOCK WARNING:
Uninteresting mock function call - returning directly.
Function call: DoThis()
NOTE: You can safely ignore the above warning unless this call should not happen...
```

**Common Causes:**

- Calling mock methods without any expectations set.

**How to Fix:**

- If calls are intentional and you want to suppress warnings, use `NiceMock` like `NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;`.
- To verify calls, add explicit `EXPECT_CALL` statements.
- To explicitly allow calls without warnings, add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());`.

---

### e. Call Order Violations

**Description:**

When using sequences (`InSequence`) or ordering constraints (`After`), calls occur out of the expected order.

**Typical Message:**

```
Unexpected mock function call
Expected call order violated by method DoA()
```

**Common Causes:**

- The code calls mock methods not in the sequence or order declared.
- Misconfigured or missing ordering expectations.

**How to Fix:**

- Review the sequence setup and ensure calls follow the defined order.
- If ordering is flexible, remove `InSequence` or `After` clauses.
- Use partial ordering with multiple sequences or the `After` clause for complex cases.

## 2. Diagnosing and Resolving Mock Errors

### Using Verbose Logging

Run your test executable with:

```
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This prints a detailed trace of all mock function calls, which expectations they matched, argument values, and stack traces. It helps answer:

- Which expectation matched a particular call?
- Why did a call not match any expectation?
- Were calls out of order?

If the output is too noisy, combine with:

```
--gtest_stack_trace_depth=0
```
to hide stack traces.

### Ensuring Correct Expectation Specification

- Always write `EXPECT_CALL` statements before any mock method is called.
- Avoid interleaving `EXPECT_CALL` and calls on the mock object.
- Use matchers judiciously — overly strict matchers cause unexpected call failures.
- Use `_` matcher to allow any value when argument values are irrelevant.
- Add catch-all expectations if your code legitimately calls methods outside your specific expectations.

### Retiring Expectations

Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations when multiple expectations on the same method overlap. This prevents failing tests from matching calls to saturated (completed) expectations.

---

## 3. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Virtual Destructors Required

Mocks must be created from classes with virtual destructors. Otherwise, deleting a mock through a base class pointer can cause undefined behavior and heap corruption.

### Sticky Expectations

By default, expectations remain active even after reaching their `Times()` upper bounds. This can cause confusing upper-bound violations if multiple expectations on the same method overlap. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to avoid this.

### Default Actions and ON_CALL

Define default behaviors using `ON_CALL` to avoid surprises, especially for non-void methods. Otherwise, calls without expectations return default-constructed values which may cause your test logic to silently fail.

### Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls

- *Uninteresting* calls have no matching expectation. They cause warnings unless suppressed.
- *Unexpected* calls violate existing expectations and always cause test failures.

Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers to control how uninteresting calls are treated.

### Beware of Overly Specific Expectations

Overly strict argument matching or call counts can make tests brittle. Prefer flexible matchers and allow optional calls where appropriate.

---

## 4. Resolving Assertion Failures

Assertion failures occur when the test’s expected state or values do not match reality. Key tips:

- Use `ASSERT_*` for conditions that must hold for the test to proceed.
- Use `EXPECT_*` for verifications where failing doesn't prevent subsequent checks.
- Read the failure messages carefully to identify which assertion failed and why.
- Use matchers with rich descriptions in `EXPECT_THAT` to produce clear diagnostic messages.
- To debug, isolate the failing test and run it with verbose output flags.

## 5. Troubleshooting Steps Summary

<Steps>
<Step title="Run with Verbose Output">
Execute your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed matching and call flow.

</Step>
<Step title="Review Ordering Constraints">
Ensure calls respect ordering (`InSequence`, `After`) or relax constraints.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Mock Setup">
Make sure mocks are instantiated correctly, with virtual destructors, and no lifecycle issues.
</Step>
<Step title="Use NiceMock or StrictMock Appropriately">
Configure mock strictness to suppress or enforce uninteresting call warnings/errors.
</Step>

## 6. Example: Diagnosing a Test Failure

```cpp
using ::testing::_;        // Wildcard matcher
using ::testing::Return;

class MockTurtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsSquare) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(10)).Times(4);

  Painter p(&turtle);
  p.DrawSquare(10);
}
```

- If the test fails with "Actual function call count doesn't match this expectation: Expected: to be called 4 times Actual: called 3 times", then the code didn't make four `Forward(10)` calls.
- Run with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see what calls were recorded.
- Adjust the test or implementation to ensure the calls happen correctly.

<Tip>
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` as your first step to debug test failures related to mocks. It reveals exactly how calls matched expectations and shows reasons for mismatches.
</Tip>

<Note>
Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings about calls to mock methods without expectations when such calls are intentional.
</Note>

<Warning>
Setting expectations after a mock method has been called results in undefined behavior and hard-to-debug errors. Always set expectations before exercising the mock.
</Warning>

<Check>
Ensure all mocked classes have virtual destructors to avoid memory and lifecycle issues.
</Check>
