# Performance Optimization Tips

GoogleTest enables you to write robust and maintainable tests, but as your codebase grows and tests multiply, maintaining test execution speed and reliability becomes critical. This page provides practical strategies to enhance test performance, reduce flaky tests, and efficiently scale your testing efforts. We'll cover actionable techniques such as test filtering, parallel test execution, and leveraging advanced mock matchers and mock types to optimize your workflow.

## 1. Speeding Up Test Execution

### Use Test Filtering to Run Only Relevant Tests

When working on a feature or fixing a bug, running the entire test suite can be slow and inefficient. GoogleTest provides a flexible test filtering mechanism to target only specific tests.

- **Using the `--gtest_filter` flag**: Specify patterns to include (and optionally exclude) tests.

Example:
```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest
```

This runs the test named `MyTest` in `MyTestSuite` only.

- **Wildcards and exclusions** allow fine control:

```bash
# Run all tests in a suite except some
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*-MyTestSuite.FlakyTest
```

- **Tip:** Use filters in your IDE or script to run a focused subset, significantly reducing turnaround time.

### Run Tests in Parallel

For large test suites, parallel execution can dramatically improve total runtime.

- Utilize test runners or build systems (like Bazel or CTest) that support parallel test execution.
- GoogleTest tests are independent by design, facilitating safe parallelization.

### Reduce Test Setup/Teardown Overhead

- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) carefully to share expensive setup/teardown logic.
- Minimize resource allocations inside tests where possible.

## 2. Reducing Flaky Tests

Test flakiness—intermittent failures—hinders trust and slows development.

- **Limit Test Dependencies:** Avoid shared global states and external dependencies.
- **Use GoogleMock’s `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` Wisely:** Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and sparsely use `EXPECT_CALL` to verify actual interactions, reducing over-specification and brittleness.
- **Apply NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock Carefully:** 
  - `NiceMock` suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, useful to reduce noise.
  - `NaggyMock` (default) warns on unexpected calls.
  - `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as failures, useful when you want very strict enforcement.

Use these modifiers depending on your confidence level and test stability needs.

## 3. Strategies for Large Codebases

Scaling testing in large projects requires automation and careful test design.

### Modularize Tests

- Organize tests in suites and files mirroring your codebase structure.
- Group related mocks and helpers to reduce repetition and compile times.

### Use Advanced Matchers and Mock Types to Optimize Performance

GoogleMock `MATCHERS` and mock types can help create precise and efficient test conditions.

- **Advanced Matchers:** Use built-in matchers like `ElementsAre`, `UnorderedElementsAre`, `Pointee`, and `Field` to write concise expectations that avoid redundant verification steps.

- **Move-only Type Support:** Leverage mock support for move-only types when working with modern C++ constructs like `std::unique_ptr`.

- **NiceMock and StrictMock:** Choose appropriate mock wrappers to control verbosity and failure sensitivity without blowing up test execution.

### Minimize Mock Complexity

- Mock only necessary methods.
- Use simplified mock interfaces or adaptors when the original interface is bulky or complex.

## 4. Leveraging Test Filtering, Parallelism, and Mocks Together

Consider this typical workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Define Mocks with ONLY Necessary Methods">
Focus on crucial public interfaces. Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros in a `public:` section to avoid unnecessary mock compilation overhead.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Set Up Default Behaviors using ON_CALL">
Use `ON_CALL` to define common behaviors. Reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying critical interactions to avoid brittleness.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Use Test Filtering in Development">
Run focused tests with `--gtest_filter` to speed up feedback loops.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Scale Execution Using Parallel Test Runners">
Leverage your build tool’s parallel test execution.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Success Criteria

- Faster test runs during development.
- Reduced flaky test failures.
- Continued confidence with comprehensive suites running in CI.

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Avoid Over-specifying Expectations:** Excess `EXPECT_CALL`s can cause brittle tests. When in doubt, prefer `ON_CALL` with `WillByDefault`.
- **Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for Sequence Expectations:** Helps in chaining multiple calls where expectations should retire after use.
- **Efficient Matchers:** Use matchers like `_` for “any value” when argument values are not important.
- **Control Mock Verbosity:** Use `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning`, or `error`) to tune diagnostic output.
- **Modularize Mock Classes:** Move constructors and destructors out of header files to speed up compilation.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Avoid These Common Problems"> 
<Accordion title="Overusing EXPECT_CALL Instead of ON_CALL">
Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` constrains tests too tightly, leading to fragile test code susceptible to change. Use `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior and `EXPECT_CALL` only when you need to verify calls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Ignoring Test Parallelism Impacts">
Failing to run tests in parallel when feasible can lead to unnecessarily long execution times on large codebases.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mocking Too Many Methods or Complex Interfaces">
Mocking entire classes or over-complex mock interfaces slows down compilation and maintenance. Cut down mock surfaces to only needed parts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Not Using Test Filtering During Development">
Running full large test suites for minor code changes slows debugging. Use test filtering to target affected areas.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Not Controlling Mock Verbosity">
Excess verbose mock logging slows tests and obfuscates real issues. Use `--gmock_verbose=warning` or `error` for regular use.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Troubleshooting Performance Issues

If your tests are slow or flaky:

1. **Profile test execution time:** Identify slow tests and optimize or isolate them.
2. **Check for unnecessary dependencies or expensive initializations in test setups.**
3. **Review mock usage:** Avoid overly complex mocks or unnecessary method mocks.
4. **Enable parallel runs:** Use your build tool’s parallelization features.
5. **Use test filters during development.**
