# Continuous Integration Troubleshooting & Best Practices

## Introduction

Integrating GoogleTest into your Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline can greatly enhance your automation with reliable, repeatable test executions. However, CI environments often introduce unique challenges such as containerized builds, distributed systems, and custom test runners that require special handling.

This document addresses common CI/CD integration issues, practical troubleshooting advice, and robust best practices to ensure your GoogleTest-based tests run seamlessly and consistently in automated environments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I run GoogleTest in containerized or headless CI builds?

CI systems frequently run tests in containers or headless environments without GUI capabilities. GoogleTest is designed to work smoothly in these environments since it does not require a graphical interface. However, ensure that:

- Required dependencies are installed inside your container.
- Your test executable is correctly built and accessible.

Run your tests as you would locally; GoogleTest outputs detailed logs to `stdout` and `stderr`, which can be easily captured by CI tools.

### How do I manage and interpret test output in CI/CD pipelines?

GoogleTest provides flexible output formatting capabilities:

- Use the `--gtest_output` flag to generate XML or JSON reports that CI tools can ingest for test summaries and dashboards.

Example to generate XML report:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

- Utilize flags like `--gtest_color=auto` to enable colored output, making logs easier to scan in supporting systems.

- Suppress verbose output using `--gtest_brief=1` to show only failures.

### How to run tests in parallel or distributed across shards/machines?

GoogleTest supports sharding, which allows splitting test runs across multiple machines or processes:

- Set `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` environment variable to the total number of test shards.
- Set `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to the zero-based index of the current shard.

The test executable will then run a subset of tests assigned to the shard.

Example for shard 1 in a 3-shard setup:

```bash
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./my_test
```

### What if my tests are not discovered or appear missing in the CI environment?

Common causes include:

- Missing or misconfigured main function or initialization.
- Incorrect linking of GoogleTest libraries.
- Test binaries built with incompatible platform settings.

Verify your test binary by listing tests:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_list_tests
```

If no tests appear, revisit setup and linking steps.

### Can GoogleTest work with custom test runners or wrappers in CI?

Yes. Since GoogleTest test executables conform to common command-line interface patterns, they can be invoked by custom test runners, scripts, or frameworks.

Ensure you:

- Initialize GoogleTest properly with `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before running tests.
- Propagate the exit code from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` back to the runner to reflect success or failure.

### How do I handle flaky or timing-dependent tests in CI?

- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to re-run tests multiple times for stability checks.
- Employ `--gtest_shuffle` and `--gtest_random_seed` to randomize test execution order and detect inter-test dependencies.

Example:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_repeat=10 --gtest_shuffle
```

### How to exclude unstable or disabled tests in CI runs?

Prefix test names or suites with `DISABLED_` to exclude them, or use filters:

- By default, `DISABLED_` tests are skipped.
- To run disabled tests, use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

You can also filter tests using the `--gtest_filter` flag.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Tests Failing Silently or Not Executing

- **Cause**: Your test executable does not call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` or exit code is ignored.
- **Solution**: Verify your `main()` returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. For example:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### 2. Test Output Mixed with Other Logs

- **Cause**: Test output and logs are both sent to `stderr`.
- **Solution**: Redirect GoogleTest output to `stdout` and logs to `stderr` or separate streams as needed, enabling easier parsing.

### 3. Deadlocks or Hanging in Death Tests on CI

- **Cause**: Death tests run in subprocesses which may conflict with multi-threaded CI runners.
- **Solution**:
  - Prefer thread-safe death test style (`GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe")`).
  - Avoid global threads or shared state that interfere with forking.

### 4. Sharding Misconfiguration

- **Cause**: `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` or `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` environment variables are missing or inconsistent across shard machines.
- **Solution**: Confirm variables are set correctly and consistently before test runs.

### 5. Container Environment Missing Shared Libraries or Dependencies

- **Cause**: Containers may lack libraries needed at runtime.
- **Solution**: Validate container build includes all necessary dependencies, and that test binary paths are correct.

## Best Practices for Reliable CI Integration

### Use Explicit Test Initialization

Always initialize GoogleTest and GoogleMock frameworks appropriately in your test executable:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv); // Combines both GoogleTest and GoogleMock
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Generate Structured Reports

Leverage GoogleTest's XML and JSON output formats for integration with CI tools and dashboards.

Example for Jenkins or TeamCity:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_output=xml:test_results.xml
```

### Leverage Test Filtering

Use filters to run only relevant tests in specific CI jobs, improving speed and diagnostics.

Example:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_filter=MySuite.*-MySuite.FlakyTest
```

### Address Flaky Tests

- Repeat tests using `--gtest_repeat` and analyze failures.
- Shuffle tests with `--gtest_shuffle` to detect implicit dependencies.
- Mark unstable tests `DISABLED_` to exclude until fixed.

### Enable Color and Verbosity Appropriately

In CI systems supporting ANSI colors, enable colors for readability:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_color=yes
```

Control verbosity with:

- `--gtest_brief=1` to see only failures.

### Setup Environment Variables

Configure common environment variables:

| Variable             | Purpose                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS   | Number of shards for parallel run |
| GTEST_SHARD_INDEX    | Index of current shard             |
| GTEST_FILTER         | Tests to run filter                |
| GTEST_OUTPUT         | Output report format/path          |

This enables smooth CI orchestration.
