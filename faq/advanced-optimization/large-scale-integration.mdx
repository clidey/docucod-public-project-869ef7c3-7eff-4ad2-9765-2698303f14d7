# Integrating with Large Builds and CI Systems

This page offers practical guidance for integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock with large-scale build systems and continuous integration (CI) environments. It focuses on best practices for configuration, automated test execution, reporting, and troubleshooting to ensure smooth operation in complex workflows.

---

## 1. Overview of Integration Challenges

Integrating GoogleTest effectively with large builds and CI pipelines requires attention to how tests are discovered, built, executed, and reported. Users typically aim to:

- Automate test execution with minimal manual intervention.
- Ensure test results are visible and actionable within CI dashboards.
- Handle test failures gracefully and receive clear diagnostics.
- Scale test execution across multiple shards or parallel jobs to reduce latency.

Understanding these challenges upfront enables correct configuration and smooth continuous testing.

## 2. Preparing GoogleTest for Build System Integration

### Build System Compatibility
GoogleTest supports popular build systems like CMake and Bazel, enabling:

- Adding GoogleTest sources to your build targets.
- Linking GoogleTest libraries against test executables.
- Registering tests for automatic discovery.

Practical setup examples are available in the [Build System Integration Guide](guides/integration-optimization/build-system-integration). Users should ensure:

- The GoogleTest target is properly linked.
- Tests are compiled with C++17 or later.
- Necessary compiler flags and definitions align with GoogleTest requirements (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](getting-started/setup-requirements/prerequisites-system-requirements)).

### Generating Test Executables
Define test executables in your build system to include your test sources and GoogleTest linkage. Confirm that tests register and appear when running the executable with `--gtest_list_tests`.

<Callout type="tip">
In CMake, consider using `enable_testing()` and `add_test()` to integrate GoogleTest executables with CTest, improving test automation and reporting.
</Callout>

## 3. Automating Test Execution in Continuous Integration Pipelines

### Running Tests in CI
Configure your CI system to:

- Build the test executable using your build system configuration.
- Invoke the test executable, ideally passing appropriate flags to control execution.

### Recommended Flags for CI Environments
Use these flags to enhance CI integration:

- `--gtest_output=xml:<path>`: Generates an XML report consumable by CI dashboards.
- `--gtest_color=no`: Disables colored output to ensure plain logs.
- `--gtest_brief=1` or `--gtest_brief`: Limits output to failures to reduce log noise.
- `--gtest_fail_fast`: Stop tests at the first failure for faster feedback.
- `--gtest_shuffle`: Randomize test order to detect order-dependent issues.
- `--gtest_repeat=N`: Repeat tests multiple times for detecting flaky tests.

### Parsing Test Reports
Most CI systems parse GoogleTest XML reports to display test results. Ensure:

- The XML output path is writable and accessible.
- Your CI configuration references the XML file correctly.

<Callout type="note">
GoogleTest also supports JSON reports via `--gtest_output=json:<path>`, which some systems may prefer.
</Callout>

## 4. Scaling Test Execution

For large test suites, parallelism and distribution reduce build pipeline duration.

### Test Sharding
GoogleTest supports sharding tests across multiple machines or processes to speed up execution.

**Integration steps:**

1. Set environment variables:
   - `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: total number of shards.
   - `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: the current shard index (0-based).
2. Run the same test executable on all shards.

GoogleTest will run a unique subset of tests per shard, ensuring full coverage collectively.

### Parallel Test Execution
Enable parallel runs with native features of build systems like CTest or use test runners that support concurrency.

### Best Practices
- Balance shard sizes to avoid bottlenecks.
- Collect and merge test reports from all shards for unified results.
- Use CI mechanisms to rerun failed shards selectively.

Refer to the [Performance Optimization & Scalability Guide](guides/integration-optimization/performance-optimization) for detailed strategies.

## 5. Handling Test Failures and Troubleshooting in CI

### Common Integration Issues
- **Test Discovery Failures:** Ensure tests are registered correctly and filters do not exclude tests unintentionally.
- **Environment Differences:** CI environments might lack dependencies or have differing platformsâ€”validate consistent environments.
- **Death Test Failures:** Death tests can be sensitive to threading and environment. Use `GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe")` if issues arise.

### Diagnosing Failures
- Review console logs and XML reports for detailed failure information.
- Enable verbose output if necessary by passing `--gtest_verbose=1` (if supported).

### Preventing Integration Problems
- Keep test names and suite names consistent; avoid underscores as per naming conventions.
- Use `DISABLED_` prefix to temporarily disable flaky tests and track them.
- Record additional properties per test with `RecordProperty()` for richer reporting.

See the [Continuous Integration Setup Guide](guides/integration-optimization/continuous-integration-setup) for step-by-step CI setup and troubleshooting.

## 6. Advanced Topics

### Custom Event Listeners
GoogleTest allows defining custom event listeners to override or extend test reporting formats in CI pipelines.

### Registering Tests Programmatically
For advanced dynamic test registration scenarios in large projects, use `testing::RegisterTest()`. This ensures all tests are discoverable and manageable within CI.

### Integration with Logging and Mocks
Ensure that mock expectations and logging are compatible with CI outputs and don't interfere with test result parsing.

### Using Parameterized and Typed Tests in CI
Parameterized test suites generate multiple test cases automatically, enabling broad test coverage within CI. Proper instantiation and naming strategies enhance CI test filtering and reporting.

## 7. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always link to the official GoogleTest GitHub repository: [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent name collisions.
- Use XML or JSON report outputs in CI for accurate result parsing.
- Run `--gtest_list_tests` during CI debug sessions to verify proper test registration.
- For flaky tests, leverage `--gtest_repeat` to detect and diagnose intermittent failures.
- Use `DISABLED_` prefix strategically to manage problematic tests while maintaining history.
- Leverage build system integration guides ([CMake](guides/integration-optimization/build-system-integration), [Bazel](overview/architecture-features/integration-and-dependencies)) for platform-aligned build setups.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Integration Problems

<AccordionGroup title="Common Integration Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Discovered or Running in CI">
If tests are not running as expected:

- Confirm that tests are correctly registered and linked.
- Verify that the test executable runs and lists tests with `--gtest_list_tests` locally.
- Ensure your CI filters and environment variables do not exclude all tests accidentally.
- Make sure parameterized tests are instantiated; otherwise, they will not run.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="XML Output Not Generated or Not Found">
- Verify that your test executable has write permission to the output directory.
- Use absolute paths for the `--gtest_output` flag.
- Check CI runner logs for file system errors.
- Confirm that the CI server is configured to collect the report files.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Death Tests Failing or Hanging in CI">
- Run death tests with the `threadsafe` style: `GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");`
- Avoid creating threads before death tests execute.
- Isolate side effects in death tests; they run in child processes and do not affect parent process state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Flakiness and Timing Issues">
- Use sharding and repetition flags to identify flaky tests.
- Review logs to determine order dependencies.
- Introduce randomness (`--gtest_shuffle`) to catch hidden dependencies.
- Consider isolating and reworking flaky tests with test fixtures or mocking.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
