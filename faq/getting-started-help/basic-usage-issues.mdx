# Basic Usage and Troubleshooting FAQ

This FAQ provides clear, actionable answers to frequent questions about installing, setting up, and running your first tests with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It also offers practical guidance for resolving common beginner issues such as linking errors, missing symbols, and incompatible compiler settings.

---

## 1. Installation and Setup

### Q: How do I verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly installed and integrated into my project?

**A**: After installing, build your test executable and run it using:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_list_tests
```

This command lists all registered tests but does not run them, confirming successful integration. For a more detailed check, run:

```bash
./my_test_executable
```

Ensure tests start running and complete without linker or runtime errors.

### Q: Why do I get linking errors or undefined symbols when building my test executable?

**A**: Common causes include:

- Not linking against the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Missing `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` when using the provided main functions.
- Mixing incompatible compiler flags or runtimes between your code and GoogleTest/GoogleMock.

**Fix:**

- Make sure your build system includes the required GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Explicitly link `gtest_main` for GoogleTest tests or `gmock_main` when mocking is used.
- Use consistent compiler standards (C++17) and flags for your project and GoogleTest.

Refer to the [Installing GoogleTest (CMake & Bazel)](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake-bazel) guide for detailed integration steps.

### Q: What compiler standards and platforms are supported?

**A**: GoogleTest requires a compiler supporting C++17 or later. It supports Linux, Windows, and macOS. Compatible compilers include GCC, Clang, and MSVC. Ensure your build environment complies with these requirements. See [System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) for details.

## 2. Running Your First Tests

### Q: How do I write and run my first test?

**A**: Write a simple test using the `TEST` macro:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MyFirstTest, SimpleCheck) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and run this executable; it should run your test and report success.

Refer to [Writing Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test-validation/writing-your-first-test) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

### Q: How do I run only a subset of tests?

**A**: Use the `--gtest_filter` flag with a pattern matching test suite or test names:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=MyFirstTest.*
```

This runs all tests in the `MyFirstTest` suite. You can use wildcards (`*`) and exclude tests with `-`:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=MySuite.*-MySuite.TestName
```

See [Running Tests with Filters](docs/reference/testing.md#filtering-tests) for more.

### Q: What if my tests don’t seem to execute or all are skipped?

**A**: Possible reasons include:

- Tests are disabled with `DISABLED_` prefix.
- The filter excludes all tests.
- Environment variables or flags like `--gtest_fail_if_no_test_selected` enforced strict checks.

Check your test names and filters, and remove `DISABLED_` if present. Also, review startup logs for filter evaluation.

## 3. Common Beginner Issues

### Q: Why do I get warnings about "Uninteresting mock function calls"?

**A**: This warning occurs when a mock method is called, but there is no `EXPECT_CALL` expectation set on it. By default, GoogleMock reports unassigned calls to alert you of potentially missing expectations.

**How to fix:**

- If you intend to ignore calls, wrap your mock class in `NiceMock`: `NiceMock<MockClass> mock;` to suppress these warnings.
- Explicitly add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` if you expect calls but do not care about constraints.
- Otherwise, add the necessary `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expected calls.

See [Understanding Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls](docs/reference/mocking.md#uninteresting-vs-unexpected).

### Q: My mock method is called with unexpected arguments and test fails. How should I handle this?

**A**: If the call arguments do not match any existing `EXPECT_CALL` matcher, it is an *unexpected call* leading to a test failure.

- Define an `EXPECT_CALL` with matchers that cover all expected argument variations, or add a fallback using wildcard matcher `_` with `.Times(AnyNumber())`.
- For precise control, use argument matchers such as `Eq()`, `Ge()`, or custom matchers to verify calls.

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(Eq(5)));  // Expect only argument 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(_)).Times(AnyNumber());  // Default catch
```

Refer to [Setting Expectations](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#UseOnCall) and [Matchers Reference](api-reference/gmock-api/matchers-reference) for details.

### Q: How do I deal with "Excessive call" errors?

**A**: Excessive call errors happen when a method is called more times than the expectation.

- Check the `.Times()` clause in your `EXPECT_CALL` and adjust it.
- Use `.Times(AnyNumber())` if there is no upper limit.
- If you want an expectation to retire after saturation, add `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Func(_)).Times(2).RetiresOnSaturation();
```

This prevents further calls matching this expectation after 2 calls.

## 4. Debugging and Validation Tips

### Q: How do I confirm my GoogleTest setup when tests run but behave unexpectedly?

**A**: Use **quick validation checks**, such as:

- Running with `--gtest_list_tests` to check test discovery.
- Running with `--gtest_filter=*` to run all tests.
- Verifying test outputs.
- Enabling verbose logging (`--gtest_verbose=info`) for detailed test execution information.

See [Quick Validation & Troubleshooting](/getting-started/first-test-validation/quick-validation-checks) for a checklist and troubleshooting steps.

### Q: How can I add helpful tracing information to understand test failures better?

**A**: Use the `SCOPED_TRACE()` macro inside your test or helper functions:

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Custom trace message");
```

GoogleTest then includes this trace in failure output, helping pinpoint which invocation caused the failure.

Example:

```cpp
void Helper(int n) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("Iteration " + std::to_string(n));
  EXPECT_EQ(Foo(n), 5);
}

TEST(MyTest, MultiCheck) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    Helper(i);
  }
}
```

See [Adding Traces to Assertions](docs/advanced.md#adding-traces-to-assertions).

## 5. Using GoogleMock

### Q: When should I use `ON_CALL` versus `EXPECT_CALL`?

**A**: Use `ON_CALL` to specify *default behavior* of mock methods without setting call expectations. It defines what happens when the method is called but does not verify that it was called.

Use `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to set an *expectation* that the method will be called with specific arguments, possibly verifying call count, order, and behavior.

Good practice is to set up default responses with `ON_CALL` and use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly, only to verify important interactions.

See [Setting Expectations](docs/reference/mocking.md#UseOnCall) for detailed guidance.

### Q: How can I handle methods with multiple overloads when mocking?

**A**: Mock each overload using the correct `MOCK_METHOD` signature and use the `Const()` wrapper or explicit matchers to disambiguate calls in expectations.

Example:

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const, override));
};

EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue());       // non-const
EXPECT_CALL(Const(mock), GetValue());  // const
```

Refer to [Mocking Overloaded Methods](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#MockingOverloadedMethods) and [Selecting Overloaded Functions](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#SelectOverload).

### Q: What are the strictness levels in GoogleMock and how do they affect my tests?

**A**: GoogleMock provides `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock` (default), and `StrictMock` wrappers.

- `NiceMock`: suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock`: (default) warns on uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock`: treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Choose the strictness level based on how strictly you want to validate mock interactions. For most tests, `NiceMock` helps reduce noise. Use `StrictMock` to enforce strict interaction contracts.

See [The Nice, the Strict, and the Naggy](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#NiceStrictNaggy) and the API Reference on strictness.

## 6. Error Messages and Common Troubleshooting

### Q: What do "Unexpected call", "Excessive call", and "Uninteresting call" errors mean?

**A**:

- **Unexpected call**: Your test set `EXPECT_CALL`s, but this particular call does not match any expectation, causing a failure.
- **Excessive call**: The number of times a method was called exceeds the limits defined by `.Times()`.
- **Uninteresting call**: The method was called with no corresponding expectation. It is allowed but results in a warning by default.

### Q: How do I interpret failure messages when argument matchers don't match?

**A**: The error message will show which arguments failed, and why the expectations didn’t match. Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get call and matcher information with stack traces. This helps verify if you have typos or incorrect matchers.

## 7. Additional Tips

- Use `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` to control uninteresting call warnings and errors, balancing test noise and strictness.
- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS();` in `main()`.
- Avoid disabling tests (`DISABLED_` prefix) long-term; prefer fixing them.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to provide contextual information in failing subroutines.
- Refer to official GoogleMock and GoogleTest cookbooks and references for advanced mocking patterns.
