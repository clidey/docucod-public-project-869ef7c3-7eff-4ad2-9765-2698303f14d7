# Supported Platforms & Compatibility

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed with portability and broad platform support in mind, enabling reliable C++ test and mock code across diverse environments. This documentation clarifies which operating systems, compilers, and system configurations are officially supported and provides guidance for resolving portability or build issues encountered on various platforms.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports widely-used desktop and server operating systems, with ongoing efforts to maintain compatibility and stability on less common platforms.

- **Primary Supported OSes:**
  - Linux
  - Windows (including Desktop, MinGW, and Mobile variants)
  - macOS (including iOS)
  - FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
  - Solaris
  - AIX
  - Fuchsia (community-supported, not officially supported)

- **Additional Platforms:**
  - Cygwin
  - DragonFlyBSD
  - Haiku
  - QNX
  - GNU/Hurd
  - z/OS
  - Some embedded platforms such as Xtensa, ESP32, ESP8266

Support is strongest for Linux, Windows, macOS, and major BSD variants due to active maintenance and usage.

<Info>
GoogleTest depends on native platform detection macros internally (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`) to identify the build environment and enable or disable platform-specific features.
</Info>

---

## 2. Compiler and Language Requirements

- **C++ Standard:** Minimum C++17 support is mandatory. GoogleTest uses modern language features that require this standard.
- **Supported Compilers:**
  - GCC (including versions supporting C++17)
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) 2017 update 3 or later
  - Intel C++ Compiler and others with adequate C++17 support

Users must ensure their compiler toolchain is configured to compile with C++17 or later, for example, passing `-std=c++17` or equivalent flags.

<Note>
GoogleTest will fail to build or run correctly if C++17 support is missing, which is checked during compilation with an error message for earlier language versions.
</Note>

---

## 3. Threading and Synchronization

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where:
  - POSIX threads (pthreads) are available (Linux, macOS, BSDs, and others)
  - Windows native threading models are supported except certain mobile variants

- You can check the `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro in your environment to verify thread safety.
- To override automatic detection, users may define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` depending on their environment.

---

## 4. Platform and Feature Macros

GoogleTest defines a series of macros so that tests and code depending on GoogleTest can adapt based on platform capabilities:

- **Operating System Macros:** `GTEST_OS_<PLATFORM>` (e.g., `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`)
- **Feature Availability:**
  - `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` — Whether exceptions are enabled
  - `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` — RTTI (Run Time Type Information) availability
  - `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` — File system support
  - `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` — Death test support
  - `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE` — POSIX regular expressions availability
  - `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` — Support for redirecting standard I/O streams

These macros are automatically set by the library but can be overridden for special cases.

---

## 5. Death Test Support

- Death tests require file system support and platform capabilities to spawn and monitor child processes.
- Supported platforms enabling death tests include Linux, macOS (not iOS), Windows Desktop, BSDs, Solaris, AIX, and others.

<Warning>
Attempting to run death tests on unsupported platforms or configurations may fail or cause unexpected behavior.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Regular Expression Engines

GoogleTest uses one of several regex implementations depending on platform capabilities:

- When built with Abseil, RE2 regex engine is used for efficiency and correctness.
- If Abseil is not used and POSIX regex is available (`GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`), POSIX extended regex is employed.
- Otherwise, a simple internal regex engine is used.

---

## 7. Building on Various Platforms

### Using CMake

- GoogleTest provides a cross-platform CMake build system that detects platform features automatically.
- To build on your platform:

  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ```

- You can disable building GoogleMock with `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.

- CMake handles linking with pthread and other platform-specific dependencies.

### Windows Considerations

- When building with MSVC, pay attention to runtime library settings to avoid linker errors due to mismatched static vs dynamic CRT.
- Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to switch between static/dynamic runtimes.

---

## 8. Common Portability Pitfalls & Recommendations

- **C++ Standard:** Ensure your project uses at least C++17, or builds will fail.
- **Threading:** If multi-threading support is needed, verify that pthread or Windows threading is correctly linked and available.
- **Exceptions:** GoogleTest expects exceptions by default; disable with care, as this may limit features.
- **RTTI:** If RTTI is disabled in your build environment, some GoogleTest dynamic_cast and typeid usages may fail.

<Tip>
Consult `gtest-port.h` macros if you encounter platform detection or build issues; defining them manually in build flags can resolve ambiguous scenarios.
</Tip>

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Platform Compatibility

If you experience build or runtime problems related to platform support:

1. **Verify Compiler and Standard:** Check compiler version and ensure C++17 is enabled.
2. **Inspect Macros:** Search for GoogleTest macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` or `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` to confirm correct environment detection.
3. **Adjust Build Flags:** Override platform macros if necessary via `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` or similar.
4. **Linking Issues:** Ensure proper linkage to threading libraries, especially on Linux and BSD where pthread is external.
5. **Check for Known Platform Gaps:** Some embedded or obscure OSes might have limited or no support.

If unresolved, consider reporting issues or contributing patches to improve support.

## 11. Summary

This documentation clarifies that GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of platforms primarily focused on the major OSes Linux, Windows, and macOS, with many POSIX-compliant Unix-like systems also supported. Thread safety, exception handling, RTTI, and file system presence are important feature requirements. Users should ensure C++17 compliance and validate platform-specific macros if encountering portability issues. Comprehensive build instructions via CMake are provided to assist in setting up on all major platforms.

<Tip>
Keeping your compiler and build system updated and aligning them with Google’s supported platform matrix ensures smoother integration and fewer compatibility challenges.

### Code and Configuration Snippet: Checking Platform Support Macros
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "gtest/internal/gtest-port.h"

int main() {
#if GTEST_OS_LINUX
  std::cout << "Running on Linux platform.\n";
#elif GTEST_OS_WINDOWS
  std::cout << "Running on Windows platform.\n";
#elif GTEST_OS_MAC
  std::cout << "Running on macOS platform.\n";
#else
  std::cout << "Unknown or unsupported platform.\n";
#endif
  return 0;
}
```

### Build Command with C++17 and pthread enabled (Linux/macOS)

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17
