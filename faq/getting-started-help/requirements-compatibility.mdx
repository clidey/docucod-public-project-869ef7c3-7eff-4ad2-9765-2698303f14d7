# Supported Platforms and Compilers

This page provides a clear overview of the operating systems, compilers, C++ standards, and environment requirements supported by GoogleTest. It helps users quickly verify if their development environment is compatible with GoogleTest and explains key considerations for building and running tests reliably.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms, following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). The major supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (various distributions, including Android variants)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions including Visual Studio environments)
- **macOS** (including derivatives like iOS for limited support cases)
- **Unix-like systems** such as BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly), Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and others
- **Embedded and specialized platforms** with limited support including Native Client (NaCl), Haiku, QNX, Fuchsia, ESP8266, ESP32, XTENSA, NXP QN9090, NRF52

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform being built on through preprocessor macros to adapt features appropriately.


## Supported Compilers and Toolchains

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler with support for the C++17 standard or newer. The supported compilers are:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection), version 7.0 or later recommended
- **Clang**, including Apple Clang with full C++17 support
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++), VS 2017 Update 3 or later (version 19.11+)
- **Intel C++ Compiler** compatible with GCC or Clang frontends
- **SunPro**, **IBM VisualAge**, **HP aCC**, and others with partial or legacy support requiring manual validation

For best results, ensure that your compiler is configured to use C++17 and that necessary runtime libraries are consistent (for example, static vs dynamic runtimes on Windows).


## C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest mandates using **C++17** or a later C++ standard to build successfully. This requirement ensures access to language features and standard library improvements foundational for GoogleTest functionality.

To specify this in your build environment, for example with CMake, use:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Otherwise, it can be passed as a compiler flag:

```bash
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17"
```


## Threading and Multi-thread Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where the pthread library is available, including most Unix-like systems. This allows safe concurrent usage of assertions and test execution.

If pthread support is not automatically detected or you wish to override it, define the following compiler flags:

```
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1   // Enable pthread support
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0   // Disable pthread support
```

On Windows, GoogleTest uses native Windows threading primitives instead of pthreads.


## Building GoogleTest - Platform Considerations

### CMake Support (Cross-Platform)

GoogleTest provides comprehensive CMake scripts (`CMakeLists.txt`) to build on all supported platforms. CMake generates platform-specific build files:

- On **Linux/Unix**: generates Makefiles; build with `make`
- On **Windows**: generates Visual Studio solution and project files
- On **macOS**: generates Xcode project files

This enables straightforward integration and building in your native environment.

### Visual Studio Runtime Compatibility

By default, Visual Studio projects link the C runtime dynamically while GoogleTest links it statically, which causes linker errors. To resolve this, GoogleTest offers the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` which switches GoogleTest to use the dynamic runtime to match Visual Studio projects:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```


### Shared Library (DLL) Usage on Windows

GoogleTest is typically built as a static library for simplicity and speed. If you need a shared library:

- Add `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to compile GoogleTest as a DLL.
- Add `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when compiling your tests using this shared library.

Proper linker flags to produce shared DLLs must also be specified.


## Dealing with Macro Name Clashes

Since GoogleTest uses macros extensively (e.g., `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`), naming conflicts can arise if other libraries define the same macros.

To avoid clashes, GoogleTest supports renaming such macros by defining flags that disable the original macros, e.g.,

```bash
-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
```

This causes GoogleTest to rename the macro from `TEST` to `GTEST_TEST`, requiring you to use the new name explicitly.


## Ongoing Platform Deprecations and Support Policy

GoogleTest aligns with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) which evolves over time. Some older platforms and compilers may become deprecated or receive limited support as C++ standards and tooling evolve.

Users are encouraged to consult the official policy and regularly update their toolchains to maintain compatibility.

<Tip>
To verify your compiler and platform compatibility quickly, check whether your environment meets the C++17 support requirement and that your OS is among the supported platforms. Use CMake integration to generate native build files suitable for your system.
</Tip>

<Note>
Building GoogleTest on unsupported or highly customized platforms may require manual adjustments to platform macros or custom configurations. Review `gtest-port-arch.h` and related headers for low-level platform detection details.
</Note>

<Warning>
Do not ignore runtime library mismatches on Windows (static vs dynamic CRT). These often cause subtle runtime errors and linker failures.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Questions">
<Accordion title="What if my compiler does not support C++17?">
GoogleTest requires at least C++17. If your compiler version does not support this, you must update your compiler or toolchain. Attempts to build with earlier C++ standards will result in errors during compilation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I build GoogleTest on Windows without Visual Studio?">
Yes, but Visual Studio is the officially supported Windows compiler. Alternative compilers like MinGW can work but may require additional setup and manual fixes related to pthreads emulation and runtime integration.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I check if pthread is enabled?">
Include `<gtest/gtest.h>` and verify that the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` is defined to 1. Alternatively, enable or disable explicitly with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are embedded or mobile platforms fully supported?">
Embedded platforms and mobile variants may have limited support. Some features such as death tests or stream redirection may be disabled due to platform constraints.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example CMake Configuration for GoogleTest

Here is a minimal example integrating GoogleTest into your project using CMake, ensuring compatibility with supported platforms and compilers:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTestProject CXX)

# Enable C++17 standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Fetch GoogleTest source during configuration
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.17.0.zip
)
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE) # Fix for Visual Studio runtime
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

# Add your test executable
add_executable(my_tests test/my_tests.cpp)

target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)

# Enable testing
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

This example handles platform and compiler compatibility automatically.
