- **Expected vs Actual Behavior:** Clearly state what you expected and what actually happened.
- **Environment Details:** Include OS, compiler version, platform, GoogleTest version, and build system.
- **Logs and Error Messages:** Copy any relevant output verbatim.

### Feature Request Guidelines

- **Use Case Description:** Explain why you need the feature.
- **Proposed Behavior:** Describe how you envision the feature working.
- **Impact:** Indicate the benefits for users or projects.

### Reporting Etiquette
