# Resolving Common Test Failures & Errors

GoogleTest helps you write reliable C++ tests, but like any testing framework, users may encounter test failures, assertion errors, environment issues, or unexpected test runner behavior. This guide walks you through identifying the typical causes of these problems and provides clear, actionable steps to diagnose and fix them. It emphasizes understanding failure messages, interpreting test output, debug workflows, and points to resources for complex troubleshooting.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Failures

When a GoogleTest test fails, it usually prints detailed diagnostic information including:

- The file and line number where the failure occurred
- The failed assertion and its expected vs actual values
- An optional stack trace of the failure location
- Additional messages (if streamed to the assertion)

### Common Types of Failures

- **Assertion Failures**: Mismatches detected by `EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*` macros.
- **Fatal Failures**: Failures with macros starting with `ASSERT_` or `FAIL()`, cause test function to abort.
- **Non-Fatal Failures**: Failures with `EXPECT_*` macros that allow the test function to continue.
- **Setup/Teardown Failures**: Failures in `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, `SetUpTestSuite()`, or `TearDownTestSuite()`.
- **Test Environment Failures**: Failures during global environment setup or teardown.

### How to Read a Failure Message

Here's an example:

```none
/path/to/test_file.cc:42: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  foo.size()
  bar.size()
    Which is: 3 vs 4
Stack trace:
  ...
```

- The file and line identify where the assertion failed.
- The assertion type (here equality) and values help pinpoint the mismatch.
- The stack trace can help trace the call path that led to the failure.

### Using Failure Messages Effectively

- Check exact values that differ to find logic errors.
- Use stack traces to identify problematic code paths.
- Look for user-supplied messages (`<<` stream content) that give additional context.

## 2. Common Issues and Their Solutions

### 2.1 Assertion Failures

**Problem:** Your test fails assertions such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, or string comparisons.

**Steps to Resolve:**

- Review the expected and actual values reported.
- Ensure test inputs and preconditions match your test case.
- Use richer assertions or [`EXPECT_THAT`](reference/assertions.md#EXPECT_THAT) with matchers for better diagnostics.
- Add [SCOPED_TRACE](guides/advanced.md#Adding-Traces-to-Assertions) to trace calls leading to failure in subroutines.

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Checked input value at iteration " << i);
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
```

### 2.2 Fatal Failures in Setup or Teardown

**Problem:** The test fails before entering your test body, for example in `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, or static `SetUpTestSuite()`.

**Steps to Resolve:**

- Check the file and line for the failure shown in failure message or test output.
- Avoid fatal assertions like `ASSERT_*` in constructors/destructors; place them in `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` instead.
- Review fixture initialization logic.
- If the entire test suite is skipped or fails to run, ensure `SetUpTestSuite()` completes successfully.

### 2.3 Mixing TEST and TEST_F in the Same Test Suite

**Problem:** GoogleTest prints an error like "All tests in the same test suite must use the same test fixture class".

**Cause:** You have defined some tests in a test suite using `TEST()` and others using `TEST_F()`, or used different fixture classes with the same test suite name.

**Solution:**

- Use a consistent approach: all tests in a suite should use the same fixture class.
- Rename test suites or fixtures to avoid name clashes across namespaces or files.

### 2.4 Unexpected Test Output or No Tests Run

**Problem:** Tests do not execute, or no output is shown.

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

- Ensure you called `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS();`.
- Verify your `main()` returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Check that your test names and test suite names do not begin with `DISABLED_` unless intended.
- When using test filters (`--gtest_filter`), verify your filter matches existing test names.
- If using shards, ensure environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` are set correctly and match valid ranges.
- If you get a warning about "No tests selected", check your filter or shard configuration.

### 2.5 Multiple Failures in the Same Test

GoogleTest shows multiple assertion failures in the same test due to use of non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`).

**Tip:** Use fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) when earlier failures invalidate the rest of the test, to avoid cascading errors.

### 2.6 Failure in Death Tests

If your death tests are not behaving as expected:

- Name death test suites with a `*DeathTest` suffix.
- Be aware of the differences between "fast" and "threadsafe" death test styles.
- Ensure mocks leak permission using `Mock::AllowLeak` when required.

## 3. Debugging & Diagnostic Workflows

### Step-by-Step Debugging

<Steps>
<Step title="Reproduce the Failure">
Verify you can run the failing test in isolation using `--gtest_filter=TestSuite.TestName`.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Failure Output">
Carefully read the file, line number, and assertion failure message.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Scoped Tracing">
If failures occur in helper functions, add `SCOPED_TRACE` in calling code to clarify.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Test Environment">
Check for failures in setup or environment using the test output.
</Step>
<Step title="Check for Mixing TEST/TEST_F or Fixture Conflicts">
Fix any errors about inconsistent fixture usage.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Verbose Flags">
Enable verbose flags (e.g., `--gtest_break_on_failure`) to aid with debugger attachment.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Debugger"
>
Run test under debugger, break on failure location.
</Step>
<Step title="Consult Logs and Stack Traces">
Analyze stack traces and logs included with failure messages.
</Step>
<Step title="Consult Documentation & Community">
Use GoogleTest docs, guides, and GitHub issues or forums if stuck.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tips & Best Practices

- Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()`.
- Use `ASSERT_*` for checks that must stop a test immediately.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` where multiple assertion failures should be recorded.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context.
- Keep test fixtures and test registrations consistent.
- Check test filters carefully if tests don't run.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Errors

### Compilation Errors

- Fatal assertion macros like `ASSERT_*` cannot be used in non-void-returning contexts such as constructors or functions returning non-void types.

  **Solution:** Use `SetUp()` functions for fatal assertions and avoid placing assertions in constructors or destructors.

### Setup Failures

Failures in `SetUpTestSuite()` or global environments cause all tests in suite to be skipped.

**Solution:** Fix the assertions or errors in those methods to allow tests to run.

### Mixing Test Macros

Errors like "mixing TEST and TEST_F..." mean you used incompatible macros in the same test suite.

**Solution:** Avoid mixing or split tests into different suites.

### Test Does Not Run When Expected

**Causes:** Filters do not match, test disabled, or sharding environment variables misconfigured.

**Solution:** Review filter syntax, confirm `DISABLED_` prefixes, check environment variables.

### Exception Handling

Exceptions thrown in your test are logged as failures if enabled.

**Solution:** Use `--gtest_catch_exceptions=0` to avoid catching exceptions if desired.

## 5. Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Using Failure Simulation

For testing GoogleTest failures themselves or expected failure conditions, use macros from `gtest-spi.h`:

- `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` verifies `statement` causes a fatal failure with given message.
- `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` verifies a non-fatal failure.

These are useful for testing custom assertion macros or test utilities.

### Using Event Listeners for Custom Output and Debugging

You can implement a `TestEventListener` to customize test logging or perform actions on test failures and events.

### Exception to Failure Conversion

Use listeners like `ThrowListener` to convert assertion failures into exceptions if you want fatal failures to act like exceptions.

## 7. Practical Tips for Resolution

<Tip>
If encountering an error about mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`, ensure all tests within a suite use the same fixture or just plain `TEST()`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For failing tests without clear cause, isolate them using `--gtest_filter=SuiteName.TestName`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If tests are skipped or not run, verify filtering flags, environment variables for shards, and check for `DISABLED_` prefixes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `ASSERT_*` only when immediate test termination upon failure is logical. Otherwise, prefer `EXPECT_*`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Enable `--gtest_break_on_failure` when running tests inside a debugger to catch failures as they happen.
</Tip>

<Tip>
When using death tests with mocks, use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to prevent false positive failures.
</Tip>
