## Community Forums and Q&A

Active community participation accelerates problem-solving and knowledge sharing. Consider these platforms when you need advice or wish to contribute:

- **Stack Overflow:** Use tags like [`#googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`#gmock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gmock) to ask questions, browse existing issues, and find answers. The community and contributors frequently monitor these channels.

- **GitHub Discussions:** The [GoogleTest GitHub repository's Discussions page](https://github.com/google/googletest/discussions) is a place to exchange ideas, report issues, and propose feature requests.

- **Mailing Lists / Chat Rooms:** Though unofficial and not maintained by the core team, some GoogleTest user groups and chat rooms exist; check README files or community links for up-to-date participation options.

## How to File Bugs or Feature Requests

When you identify a bug or have a feature suggestion, follow established protocols to ensure efficient resolution:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before filing, verify whether your issue or idea has already been reported or addressed.
