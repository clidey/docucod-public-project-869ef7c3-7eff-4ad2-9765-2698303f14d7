# FAQ: What Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

This FAQ page clarifies the supported operating systems, compiler versions, and minimum C++ standard requirements necessary to successfully build and use the latest releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including practical advice on verifying compatibility early in your development cycle.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest targets a wide range of modern desktop and server platforms. It fully supports:

- **Linux** (including popular distributions)
- **Windows** (desktop versions and variants like MinGW)
- **Mac OS X** (including iOS for specific use cases)

In addition, GoogleTest has varying degrees of support for other Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and others as indicated by the platform-specific macros within the source.

> For a complete, detailed list of currently supported platforms and compilers, refer to [Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the
[platform matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Compilers and Language Standard Requirements

### C++ Standard Support

GoogleTest requires **at least C++17** to build and operate correctly starting from release 1.17.0. This requirement ensures access to modern language features used internally for correctness, performance, and maintainability.

Make sure your compiler is configured to use the appropriate language standard. For example:

- For **GCC/Clang**: use the flag `-std=c++17` or higher.
- For **MSVC**: target MSVC 2017 Update 3 or newer, enabling C++17 features.

### Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest is tested and known to work well with:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**, versions supporting C++17
- **Clang**, modern releases with C++17 support
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++), version 2017 Update 3 or later

Older or less common compilers may not fully support the necessary C++17 features, and GoogleTest may not build correctly or behave as expected.

### Build Tools

- **CMake** is the primary recommended build system.
- GoogleTest’s build scripts enforce C++17 and recognize most platform/compiler combinations.

Refer to the [GoogleTest README](googletest/README.md) for comprehensive build instructions and examples.

## Checking Compatibility Early

To avoid build and runtime issues, we recommend the following steps before integrating GoogleTest:

1. **Verify your compiler supports C++17.**
   Run a simple program with `-std=c++17` and confirm successful compilation.

2. **Confirm platform macros and capabilities.**
   GoogleTest detects OS and features via predefined macros. Customize build flags if necessary.

3. **Use the supplied CMake build configurations**, which include appropriate flags and compiler checks.

4. **Check GoogleTest’s supported platforms matrix** against your environment to affirm compatibility.

5. **Run a minimal test executable** (using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`) as outlined in the [GoogleTest Primer](docs/primer.md) and [Getting Started guides](getting-started/).

## Practical Tips

- Always ensure your build environment enforces at least C++17.
- Use GoogleTest’s CMake integration for smooth experience across platforms.
- Check for platform-specific flags or known issues in related documentation sections.
- When in doubt, run the `verifying-setup` guide’s sample tests to catch compatibility problems early.

---

## Summary

Supported platforms include modern Linux distributions, Windows desktop, and macOS, with GoogleTest enforcing a C++17 minimum standard starting with version 1.17.0. Compatible compilers include recent versions of GCC, Clang, and MSVC. Early verification via compiler flags and test runs ensures smooth installation and usage.

---

Happy testing with confidence that your environment aligns with GoogleTest’s requirements!
