# Minimum Requirements and Supported Platforms

This guide details the essential requirements for successfully using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, focusing on C++ standard support, compiler compatibility, and platform support. It also provides guidance on where to find updated information about platform support and addresses common setup issues due to platform or compiler mismatches.

---

## 1. Required C++ Standard

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a C++17 compliant compiler environment to build and run correctly. This standard provides essential language features that the frameworks depend on.

- Ensure your build system enforces **C++17** support, typically by setting:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If you are using a build system or workflow that does not support setting the standard conventionally, pass appropriate compiler flags like `-std=c++17` to enforce this requirement.

- Without C++17 support, the build and runtime behavior may be unpredictable or fail outright.

---

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest supports a wide range of popular compilers. Below are commonly supported compilers known to work well with GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- **GCC**
- **Clang**
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler)**
- **Intel C++ Compiler**
- **SunPro Compiler**
- **VisualAge / XL Compiler**
- **HP aCC Compiler**

### Important Notes on Compiler Versions

- Recent versions of these compilers are recommended for full C++17 compliance.
- Compiler versions without C++17 support or incomplete standard library support may lead to build errors or malfunctioning tests.
- On MSVC, to avoid runtime library conflicts, the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option is available to align GoogleTest’s runtime with that of your project.

---

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and supports many operating systems and environments:

- Microsoft Windows (Desktop, MinGW)
- Linux distributions
- macOS
- FreeBSD
- Solaris
- Other UNIX-like systems as per support listed in Google’s foundational C++ support policy

### Platform Detection

GoogleTest automatically detects platform environment macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC` to enable platform-specific implementations.

### Threading and POSIX Compliance

- On most UNIX-like platforms, GoogleTest uses **pthreads** for thread support.
- On Windows, native thread primitives are used instead of pthreads.
- If your environment does not support pthreads, threading support will be disabled.

### Exceptions and RTTI

- GoogleTest detects compiler flags to enable exception and RTTI support. Both are optional but recommended to unlock full framework features.

## 4. Where to Find Up-To-Date Platform Support

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). To view the most current list of supported platforms, compilers, and tools, consult the official matrix at:

- [Open Source Policies - Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

Additionally, a summary of currently supported platforms is maintained in the documentation:

- [GoogleTest Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md)

These resources reflect the evolving compatibility and may help identify support for exotic or newly released platforms and compilers.

## 5. Common Setup Issues and Solutions

### 5.1 Compiler Standard Mismatch

- **Problem:** Older compilers or build systems that default to a C++ version below C++17.
- **Solution:** Explicitly set the compiler standard to C++17 in your build system.

### 5.2 Runtime Library Conflicts on Windows

- **Problem:** MSDN runtime mismatch errors such as LNK2038 errors occur when GoogleTest runtime settings conflict with your project.
- **Solution:** Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
  ```

  This ensures GoogleTest links against the dynamic CRT, matching typical Visual Studio projects.

### 5.3 Thread Support Missing

- **Problem:** Test executions that require threading fail or behave unexpectedly on unsupported environments.
- **Solution:** Disable pthread support with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if pthreads are unavailable or unsupported in your environment.

### 5.4 Macro Name Conflicts

- **Problem:** GoogleTest macros clash with other libraries/macros in your project.
- **Solution:** Use the macro renaming feature by defining `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO_NAME>=1` to rename a macro, forcing you to use the prefix `GTEST_` instead.

## 6. Additional Recommendations

- Always verify your toolchain's compatibility with GoogleTest’s minimal requirements before integrating.
- Regularly consult the official platform matrix to track changes in official support.
- Use GoogleTest’s CMake options to align settings with your project and avoid common pitfalls.

## 8. Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a **C++17-compliant compiler** and support multiple widely-used compilers across UNIX-like and Windows platforms. Proper configuration of the compiler standard, runtime libraries, and threading options is essential for smooth integration. Official platform support is documented and updated regularly through Google’s foundational policies and project documentation.
