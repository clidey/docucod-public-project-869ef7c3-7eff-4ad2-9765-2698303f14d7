# Troubleshooting Test Discovery & Execution

When working with GoogleTest to create and run your first tests, it's common to encounter issues related to test discovery, execution, or test runner configuration. This guide helps you identify and resolve common problems, ensuring your tests run smoothly and deliver the expected results.

---

## 1. Common Problems in Test Discovery

GoogleTest discovers tests by registering them when the test binary is loaded. If your tests are not being executed, consider these possible causes and solutions.

### a. Test Functions Not Being Registered

GoogleTest relies on macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and others to register test cases during static initialization. If your tests do not run, check:

- **Macro Usage:** Ensure you are using the proper macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc.) to define tests.
- **Linkage:** All object files containing tests must be linked into the test executable. If your test source files are not compiled or linked, no tests will be registered.
- **Static Initialization Order:** Rarely, if your tests are defined in libraries loaded dynamically or in static libraries not linked directly by the test executable, tests may not register.

**Tip:** Add a simple `printf` or logging statement inside your test body to verify the code is actually reachable.

### b. Test Suites and Test Names Must Be Valid C++ Identifiers

GoogleTest requires test suite and test names in `TEST()` macros to be valid C++ identifiers (no spaces, punctuation). Invalid names will cause tests to be ignored or fail to compile.

### c. Using `TEST_F()` Without Defining Fixture Class

If using `TEST_F()`, ensure the test fixture class is declared and accessible in the test source file. Otherwise, compilation errors or test registration failures occur.

### d. Duplicate Test Names

If multiple tests share the same suite and test names, only one test will be registered, potentially shadowing others.

## 2. Issues Running Tests from `main()`

GoogleTest provides default implementations for `main()`, but in some cases, you may need to define your own. Problems here include:

### a. Missing or Incorrect Initialization

You **must** call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` or `testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv)` before running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Failure to initialize results in tests not running or flags not being processed properly.

### b. Overriding or Replacing `main()` Incorrectly

Avoid defining multiple `main()` functions or conflicting test entry points, especially when linking with libraries such as `gtest_main` which supply their own `main()`.

### c. Running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` Multiple Times

`RUN_ALL_TESTS()` must be called exactly once per test program execution. Calling it multiple times may lead to unexpected behavior.

### d. Embedded Platforms

If working on embedded systems without a main function or standard entry point (such as Arduino), ensure you use the special setup and loop hooks as required by GoogleTest.

---

## 3. Test Runner Configuration and Environment

### a. Command Line Flags Not Being Processed

Ensure you are passing the `argc` and `argv` pointers to `InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()`. Without this, GoogleTest cannot parse flags such as:

- `--gtest_filter`
- `--gtest_repeat`
- `--gtest_output`

Example:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### b. Tests Seem to Run But No Output

- Check the logging verbosity flags such as `--gtest_verbose`.
- Confirm your test code includes assertions; tests without assertions might not provide visible results.

### c. Tests Are Skipped or Filtered Out

If using filters (`--gtest_filter`), verify that the patterns correctly match your test suite and test names.

### d. Multi-threaded or Parallel Test Execution

Running tests in parallel can introduce race conditions if tests share resources. GoogleTest is thread-safe but ensure your tests are designed for parallel execution.

## 4. Practical Troubleshooting Workflow

Follow these steps to diagnose test discovery or execution issues:

<Steps>
<Step title="Confirm Test Definitions">
Verify that tests are defined using the proper macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`), and that test suites and test names are valid identifiers.
</Step>
<Step title="Build and Link Check">
Ensure all test source files are compiled and linked in the test executable.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Diagnostic Logs">
Insert print statements inside tests to confirm they are reached.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Main() Implementation">
Check that `testing::InitGoogleTest()` or `testing::InitGoogleMock()` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
</Step>
<Step title="Run with Verbose Flags">
Use flags like `--gtest_verbose=info` to get more detailed output and detect hidden errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Isolate Tests">
Try running a single test with `--gtest_filter=TestSuite.TestName` to isolate failure.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Examples of Common Mistakes

### Example 1: Missing Initialization in main()

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Missing initialization call
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

**Fix:** Add `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before running the tests.

### Example 2: Invalid Test Names

```cpp
// Invalid because of spaces ('Login Test')
TEST(Login Test, Basic) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

**Fix:** Replace with valid identifiers:

```cpp
TEST(LoginTest, Basic) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

### Example 3: Not Linking Test Source Files

If your test source files are not part of the build or link rule, no tests will be registered.

**Fix:** Add source files to your build configuration.
