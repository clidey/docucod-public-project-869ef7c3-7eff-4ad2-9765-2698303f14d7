# Troubleshooting Failed or Unexpected Mocks

When writing tests with GoogleMock, encountering failed or unexpected mock calls is common, especially as your test scenarios grow in complexity. This document provides clear guidance and solutions to diagnose and resolve common failure messages, helping you quickly identify the root causes and restore your tests’ reliability.

## Understanding Failure Messages

GoogleMock produces various failure messages depending on how mock expectations and calls mismatch. Recognizing the difference between warnings, errors, and explanations is key to efficient troubleshooting.

### Warning vs. Error
- **Warnings:** Usually arise from *uninteresting calls* — calls to mock methods without `EXPECT_CALL` defined. GoogleMock allows these but prints a warning as it might indicate a missing expectation.
- **Errors:** These correspond to *unexpected calls* or *expectation violations*. They represent calls that either do not match any `EXPECT_CALL` or violate cardinality (too many or too few calls, wrong order, etc.). Errors cause test failures.

<Tip>
Always pay close attention to error messages as they describe *why* a call failed — they include which expectations were tried and how arguments differed.
</Tip>

### Common Failure Types

| Failure Type        | What It Means | Typical Message Snippet | How GoogleMock Treats It                 |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Uninteresting Call  | No expectation set for called method | “Uninteresting mock function call” | Warning or error depending on mock strictness |
| Unexpected Call     | Called with arguments not matching any expectation | “Unexpected mock function call”  | Error                                   |
| Excessive Call      | Mock method called more times than allowed | “Mock function called more times than expected” | Error                                   |
| Unsatisfied Expectation | Expected call wasn’t made enough times | “Expected to be called at least ... but actual was less” | Error                                   |
| Unsatisfied Prerequisite | Call violates sequencing due to unmet prior calls | “Pre-requisite is not satisfied” | Error                                   |
| Mismatched Arguments | Call arguments don't match expectation | “Expected arg ..., Actual: ...” | Error                                   |

## Diagnosing Common Issues

GoogleMock failure diagnostics are designed to be detailed. Here is how to interpret and resolve the most common issues:

### 1. Mismatched Arguments
When arguments in the actual call don't match those expected, GoogleMock reports which arguments failed the matchers.

**How to resolve:**
- Check your `EXPECT_CALL` matchers for accuracy.
- Ensure bound objects (e.g., references via `Ref()`) are exactly the expected values.
- Use simpler matchers (`_`, `Ge()`, `Ne()`) as needed.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(Ref(expected_string), _, Ge(0)));
// Calling with mismatched string or negative number triggers failure.
```

### 2. Unexpected Mock Call
Occurs when a mock method is called with arguments that do not match any expectation.

**Typical message:**
```
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Bar(1, 2)
  Expected calls that didn't match:
  ...
```

**How to resolve:**
- Confirm the `EXPECT_CALL`s cover all expected cases.
- Add catch-all expectations if suitable:
  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
  ```
- Refactor to use `ON_CALL` for default behavior without expectations.

### 3. Excessive Calls
When a mock method is called more times than its expectation allows.

**Typical message:**
```
Mock function called more times than expected - returning default value.
    Function call: Bar(3, 4)
  Expected: to be called once
  Actual: called twice - over-saturated and active
```

**How to resolve:**
- Adjust `Times()` clause to allow more calls if relevant.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations when saturated.
- Add or modify expectations to reflect realistic call counts.

### 4. Unsatisfied Expectations
When an expected call wasn’t fulfilled sufficiently.

**Typical message:**
```
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(...).
Expected: to be called at least twice
Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active
```

**How to resolve:**
- Ensure the test actually exercises all expected calls.
- Review call ordering or more complex sequencing (see Partial Order below).

### 5. Unsatisfied Prerequisites
When calls violate preconditions expressed via `.After()` or `InSequence()` constraints.

**Example:**
```cpp
Sequence s;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Foo(1)).InSequence(s);
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Foo(2)).InSequence(s);

// Calling Foo(2) before Foo(1) triggers failure.
```

**How to resolve:**
- Call mock methods in the proper order as defined by sequences or After clauses.
- Check if sequencing constraints are correctly defined.

### 6. Retired Expectations
When a call matches an expectation that has been retired (i.e., no longer active).

**Typical message:**
```
Expected: the expectation is active
Actual: it is retired
```

**How to resolve:**
- Review `.RetiresOnSaturation()` usage.
- Verify mock lifetimes and whether repeated calls exceed expected usage.

## Diagnosing Uninteresting Calls

If a mock method without any `EXPECT_CALL` is called, GoogleMock treats it as uninteresting. This triggers warnings (or errors if using `StrictMock`).

### Controlling uninteresting calls:
- Use `NiceMock<MockType>` to suppress these warnings, allowing uninteresting calls silently.
- Use `StrictMock<MockType>` to treat these calls as errors.
- Define catch-all expectations with `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` if you expect calls but do not want to verify arguments strictly.

### Verbosity Levels
Set the flag `--gmock_verbose=LEVEL` to adjust GoogleMock output:
- `info`: Prints all informational messages, warnings, errors, and stack traces.
- `warning`: Prints warnings and errors; omits stack traces (default).
- `error`: Prints errors only.

<Tip>
Running with `--gmock_verbose=info` can provide richer output to help trace which expectations were matched or missed.
</Tip>

## How to Verify and Clear Expectations in Tests

Sometimes you want to verify mock expectations *before* the mock is destructed.

Use:
```cpp
bool success = Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

- Returns `true` if all expectations are satisfied.
- Generates failure reports if not.
- Do **not** set new expectations after this call.

To remove both default actions and expectations, use:
```cpp
bool success = Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock_object);
```

This helps when mock ownership is tied to application code rather than the test.

---

## Handling Leaked Mocks

Failures may arise if mocks are leaked (never destructed). GoogleMock can detect this and report errors at program exit.

Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_object)` to suppress such leaks if intentional.

<Tip>
Always prefer proper mock destruction for best test hygiene.
</Tip>

---

## Best Practices for Avoiding and Troubleshooting Failures

- **Be explicit with expectations:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you want to verify; use `ON_CALL` to define behavior without strict expectations.
- **Avoid over-specification:** Don't add unnecessary expectations that cause brittle tests.
- **Use sequence and ordering features wisely:** Use `InSequence`, `After()`, or `Sequence` objects to specify call order.
- **Use appropriate mock strictness:** `NiceMock` reduces noise, `StrictMock` enforces strict correctness.
- **Run with `--gmock_verbose=info`:** For detailed diagnostics when failures occur.
- **Check argument matching carefully:** Use simple matchers during debugging.
- **RetiresOnSaturation:** Use this to retire expectations once saturated, reducing unexpected call failures.
- **Suppress uninteresting calls smartly:** Use nice mocks or `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.

## Troubleshooting Workflow Example

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify Failure Message">
  Read the failure message carefully, noting which expectation failed and its location.
</Step>
<Step title="Examine Mock Expectations">
  Confirm the `EXPECT_CALL` statements cover the method and argument cases for the failing call.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Argument Matchers">
  Are the matchers too strict or mismatching? Relax or correct them if necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Call Count and Order Constraints">
  Verify cardinalities (`Times`), sequences (`InSequence`), and prerequisites (`After`).
</Step>
<Step title="Adjust Uninteresting Call Settings">
  If warnings arise from uninteresting calls, consider using `NiceMock` or a catch-all expectation.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Verbose Logging">
  Run test with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see matched expectations and call traces.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify and Clear Expectations (Optional)">
  Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to confirm expectations are met.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Debugging Tips

- Verify your mock classes have **virtual destructors** to avoid lifetime issues.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` with `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations expected to be used once.
- For overloaded methods, use disambiguators like `Const()` or explicit casting to select correct overload.
- When debugging argument mismatch, simplify matchers first then enhance.

## FAQs Related to Mock Failures

<AccordionGroup title="Common Failure Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Why does GoogleMock warn about uninteresting calls even if I use ON_CALL?">
GoogleMock treats uninteresting calls as potential test gaps. Even if `ON_CALL` defines behavior, the lack of `EXPECT_CALL` means no explicit expectation was set, so a warning is printed. Use `NiceMock` or add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress warnings if the calls are expected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I verify call order for multiple mock methods?">
Use `InSequence` to enforce all `EXPECT_CALL`s within a scope to be called in order. For partial orderings, use the `.After()` clause or multiple sequences with `.InSequence()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What causes “Too many actions specified in EXPECT_CALL” warnings?">
This warning indicates the number of `WillOnce()` actions exceeds the expected call count or conflicts with the cardinality. Review your `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.WillRepeatedly()` to ensure consistency.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is my mock method call reported twice as failing?">
Multiple failure messages may appear when GoogleMock detects a failure at different points in test execution. Though similar, they represent state at distinct moments, providing richer debugging info.
</Accordion>

## Example of Handling an Unexpected Call Failure

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x, int y));
};

TEST(FooTest, HandlesUnexpectedCall) {
  MockFoo foo;

  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(0, _));

  foo.Bar(0, 1);   // Matches expectation.

  EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(foo.Bar(1, 1), "Unexpected mock function call");
}
```

In this example, the second call to `Bar(1, 1)` doesn't match any expectation and generates a failure message indicating an unexpected call.

---

## Example of Excessive Call Failure

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, HandlesExcessiveCalls) {
  MockFoo foo;

  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(0, _)).Times(1);

  foo.Bar(0, 1);  // Expected call.

  EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(foo.Bar(0, 1),
                          "Mock function called more times than expected");
}
```

The second call violates the `.Times(1)` limit and triggers an error.

---

## Example of Using `RetiresOnSaturation()` to Avoid Excessive Call Errors

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, UsesRetiresOnSaturation) {
  MockFoo foo;

  {
    InSequence seq;
    EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(1)).WillOnce(Return(10)).RetiresOnSaturation();
    EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(2)).WillOnce(Return(20));
  }

  EXPECT_EQ(10, foo.Bar(1));

  EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(foo.Bar(1), "Unexpected mock function call");  // Bar(1) retired
  EXPECT_EQ(20, foo.Bar(2));
}
```

Using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` enables expectations to be retired automatically, which helps avoid “too many calls” errors for that expectation.
