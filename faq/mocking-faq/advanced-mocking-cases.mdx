# Advanced and Edge-Case Mocking Questions

This FAQ page addresses the more advanced and rare questions users encounter when customizing mock classes in GoogleMock (`gMock`). It covers topics like precise control of call ordering, managing call cardinalities, constructing complex matchers, defining custom actions, and strategies for integrating mocks with legacy or complex code bases.

---

## 1. Customizing Mock Call Ordering and Cardinalities

### How can I specify that certain mock method calls must occur in a particular order?

By default, mock expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) can match calls in any order. To enforce ordering, gMock provides:

- **InSequence:** Group expectations inside an `InSequence` object to require calls happen sequentially:

```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(2));
}
// Calls to mock.Foo(1), then mock.Bar(2) must occur in this order.
```

- **After Clause:** To specify an expectation must occur after one or more other expectations:

```cpp
Expectation foo_called = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(1));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(2)).After(foo_called);
```

This allows expressing partial ordering and even DAGs of call dependencies.

### What should I do if I want to allow multiple sequences or partial order on calls?

Create multiple `Sequence` objects and attach them with `.InSequence(s1, s2)` to expectations. Calls must then respect the partial order induced by these sequences.

Example:

```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, A()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, B()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, C()).InSequence(s2);
```

This enforces A before B and A before C but does not constrain the order between B and C.

### How do I control how many times an expectation should be matched?

Use the `.Times()` clause with cardinalities like `Exactly(n)`, `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)`, `AnyNumber()`, or `Between(m, n)`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(1)).Times(2);  // Exactly twice.
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(_)).Times(AnyNumber()); // Any number of times.
```

If `.Times()` is omitted, it is inferred based on the presence of `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()` clauses.

### What if I want an expectation to *retire* after saturation?

Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on the expectation. This means after the expected calls have occurred, the expectation becomes inactive and won't match further calls.

This is useful for expectations that should match only a fixed number of times and then let other expectations match subsequent calls.

## 2. Crafting and Using Complex Matchers

### How do I specify that an argument to a mock method matches a complex condition?

Use gMock's rich set of built-in matchers (e.g., `_`, `Ge()`, `NotNull()`, `HasSubstr()`, `ElementsAre()`, etc.) to express argument constraints. 

You can combine matchers using `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, or negate with `Not()`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(AllOf(Ge(5), Lt(10))));
```

### How can I write a matcher to check a member or property of an argument object?

Use `Field()` and `Property()` matchers:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Field(&Object::id, Eq(42))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Property(&Object::GetName, HasSubstr("Test"))));
```

These allow matching on specific members or method results within complex argument objects.

### What if I need to match arguments using tuples or multiple arguments?

Use `.With()` in an `EXPECT_CALL` to specify a matcher on the entire argument tuple:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // first arg less than second arg
```

You can also use `Args<N1, N2, ...>(matcher)` or `AllArgs(matcher)` inside `.With()`.

### How do I create a custom matcher for advanced or domain-specific criteria?

Use the `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, or implement the matcher interface directly.

Example:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsMultipleOf, n, "is multiple of " + ::testing::PrintToString(n)) {
  return (arg % n) == 0;
}
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsMultipleOf(3)));
```


## 3. Defining Custom Actions and Behavior

### How can I define what a mock method does when called?

You can specify actions in `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` using:

- **Built-in actions**, e.g. `Return()`, `ReturnRef()`, `ReturnPointee()`, `SetArgPointee<N>()`, `Invoke()`, etc.
- **Custom actions** using lambdas or functors.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_))
    .WillOnce(Return(42));

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(_))
    .WillOnce([](int x) { return x * 2; });
```

### How do I combine multiple actions in a single call?

Use `DoAll()` to chain actions executed sequentially, where the return value of the last action is returned:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<0>(5), Return(true)));
```

### Can I invoke the real method or a method of a parent class inside a mock method?

Yes. To avoid recursion, explicitly scope the parent method:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, ConcreteMethod)
    .WillByDefault([&mock](Args...) {
      return mock.ParentClass::ConcreteMethod(Args...);
    });
```

### How do I handle complex default behaviors or delegate to a real or fake instance?

Use `ON_CALL()` to set default behaviors with `WillByDefault()`. You can delegate calls to a real or fake object by forwarding from the mock’s methods:

```cpp
ON_CALL(*this, Method(_)).WillByDefault(
    [this](Args... args) { return real_.Method(args...); });
```

### How do I delete arguments or invoke callback arguments?

- To delete a pointer argument:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_))
    .WillOnce(DeleteArg<0>());
```

- To invoke a callback argument:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_, _))
    .WillOnce(InvokeArgument<1>(val));
```

### What if my mock method needs to handle move-only types (e.g. std::unique_ptr)?

Mock them normally using `MOCK_METHOD` but be cautious with actions:

- Use lambdas or callables to create or handle move-only return or argument types.
- Avoid `Return(std::move(...))` in `WillRepeatedly()`, as it will move only once.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, MakeBuzz(_))
    .WillRepeatedly([](StringPiece sp) {
       return std::make_unique<Buzz>();
    });
```

## 4. Handling Uninteresting Calls

### What are uninteresting calls and how does GoogleMock treat them?

An *uninteresting call* is a call to a mock method that has no `EXPECT_CALL` expectation.

- By default, GoogleMock treats uninteresting calls as **naggy**: it allows them but prints warnings.
- You can control this behavior per mock object by using:
  - `NiceMock<MockClass>`: suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
  - `NaggyMock<MockClass>`: prints warnings (default).
  - `StrictMock<MockClass>`: treats uninteresting calls as errors.

Example:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
nice_foo.SomeMethod();  // no warning
```

### How do I disable warnings for specific methods without using NiceMock?

Write an explicit catch-all expectation:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

But avoid overusing this as it can make your tests harder to maintain.

## 5. Working with Multiple Expectations and Shadowing

### How does gMock match a call if there are multiple expectations?

gMock searches expectations in the **reverse order** they are defined and picks the last matching active expectation. This lets you write general expectations first, and more specific ones later. It enables overriding default behaviors easily.

### What is the effect of sticky expectations?

Expectations remain active even after reaching their upper call count, unless explicitly retired with `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or are in a sequence and superseded. This prevents subtle matching errors but requires care when writing multiple expectations to avoid unintended shadowing.

### How do I test that a function is never called?

Explicitly disallow calls using:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_)).Times(0);
```

## 6. Integration with Legacy or Complex Code Bases

### Can I mock non-virtual methods?

Yes, but this requires use of template-based dependency injection rather than inheritance. Define your mock class unrelated to the original class but with matching methods. Use template parameters in production and test code to swap implementations.

Consult the [MockingNonVirtualMethods](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#MockingNonVirtualMethods) recipe for details.

### How can I mock static or global functions?

Direct mocking is not possible. Instead, introduce an interface wrapping those functions and mock the interface using gMock. This promotes decoupling and testability.

See the Google Testing Blog post on defeating static dependencies: [Defeat Static Cling](https://testing.googleblog.com/2008/06/defeat-static-cling.html).

### How can I combine mocks with existing fake implementations?

You can delegate default implementations of some methods to a fake inside your mock using `ON_CALL` with lambdas forwarding calls. This is useful when existing fake behavior is complex and you want partial interaction verification.

Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Foo).WillByDefault([this](Args... args) {
  return fake_.Foo(args...);
});
```

### How do I mock destructors or verify timing of destruction?

Mock destructors indirectly by adding a mock method (e.g. `Die()`) that the destructor calls. You can then set expectations on `Die()` to check destruction order.

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Die, ());
  ~MockFoo() override { Die(); }
};
```

## 7. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Why does gMock sometimes print multiple failure messages for the same expectation?

Each failure corresponds to a different point in time (e.g., first violation, later repeated calls violating counts). Though descriptions may look similar, they reflect distinct errors.

### What to do when MSVC warns about `const` parameters in mocks?

Remove top-level `const` qualifiers in function parameters in both base and mock class declarations, as MSVC has a known bug producing false warnings.

### How to debug why gMock says expectations aren't satisfied?

Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces of mock calls and matching expectations. Study the trace to find mismatches.

### How to avoid slow compilation of large mock classes?

Move mock class constructors and destructors definitions into `.cc` files to prevent repeated instantiations in multiple translation units.

### How to suppress uninteresting call warnings in tests?

Use `NiceMock<>` wrapper for your mock objects or add catch-all expectations with `.Times(AnyNumber())`. Avoid blindly adding expectations just to suppress warnings.

### Tips and Recommendations

- Use `ON_CALL()` to define defaults, and `EXPECT_CALL()` selectively for calls you want to verify.
- Place more general expectations before more specific expectations, remembering the last matching rule.
- When specifying call orders, use `InSequence` or `After` clauses for clear constraints.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky expectation side effects when needed.
- Use `NiceMock<>` for less noisy tests, `StrictMock<>` to enforce strict behavior.
- Leverage `Invoke()` and custom actions for complex behavior needs.
- Always ensure your mock class methods are virtual and destructors are virtual to avoid leaks and undefined behavior.

This collection of answers should empower you to take full advantage of gMock's flexible, precise, and powerful mocking capabilities, even in sophisticated or legacy code scenarios.
