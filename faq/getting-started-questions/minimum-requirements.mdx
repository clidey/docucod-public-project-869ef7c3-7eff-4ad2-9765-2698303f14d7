# What Are the Minimum Requirements to Use GoogleTest?

Ensuring your development environment meets GoogleTest's minimum requirements is essential for a smooth setup and trouble-free use. This document covers the necessary compiler versions, language standards, and platform support to help you avoid early build problems and understand dependent prerequisites.

---

## Supported Compilers and Versions

GoogleTest requires modern C++ compilers with adequate support for C++17 features. The following compilers and versions are supported:

- **GCC**: Version 7.1 or newer
- **Clang**: Version 5.0 or newer
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: 2017 or newer

Older compilers or those with incomplete C++17 support will not compile or correctly run GoogleTest and GoogleMock components.

## Required Language Standard

GoogleTest mandates **C++17** as the minimum language standard. This means:

- Your build system must be configured to compile with at least the C++17 standard flag (for example, `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or setting the appropriate MSVC flag).
- Features and language constructs introduced in C++17 are used internally, so compatibility with this standard is non-negotiable.

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest officially supports a broad range of operating systems, including:

- **Windows**
- **Linux**
- **macOS**

The framework is tested thoroughly on these platforms, ensuring reliable behavior and compatibility.

If you are using embedded platforms or less common operating systems, support might be limited, and additional configuration or adaptation could be required.

## Build Tool and Environment Considerations

- **Build tools**: GoogleTest integrates well with popular build systems like CMake, Bazel, and manual Makefile setups. Make sure your build configuration adheres to the compiler and language standards above.
- **Linkage**: Proper library linkage is crucial. C++17 support affects linkage decisions, so use the guidelines from the [Configuration and Project Setup](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-introduction/configuration-basics.mdx) documentation.

## Practical Tips to Avoid Common Issues

- **Verify compiler version and language standard** before attempting to build GoogleTest. You can usually check this by running:

  ```bash
  g++ --version
  clang++ --version
  cl.exe (Visual Studio compiler) version
  ```

- **Ensure your compiler command includes C++17 support**, e.g.:

  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 ...
  clang++ -std=c++17 ...
  cl.exe /std:c++17 ...
  ```

- If you encounter **build errors related to language features**, it usually indicates insufficient C++17 support.

- Use the [Installation (CMake, Bazel, Manual) guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation-options.mdx) for detailed, platform-specific setup instructions.


## Summary
GoogleTest requires modern compilers supporting the C++17 language standard and officially supports Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. Ensuring these baseline requirements will enable effective use of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, avoiding common compilation or runtime issues.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you see unexpected compiler errors related to C++ features, double check your compiler version and C++ standard configuration.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Attempting to use compilers or platforms without C++17 support may lead to undefined behaviors.
</Warning>

<Check>
Ensure your build tools and continuous integration environment use compatible compilers and configurations.
