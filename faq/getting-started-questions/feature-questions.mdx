# Frequently Asked Questions: Understanding Key Features of GoogleTest and GoogleMock

This FAQ page clarifies the main features and core capabilities of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It explains how the framework structures tests, discovers test and mock cases, supports parameterized and typed tests, and manages assertion types to empower you to write effective and maintainable C++ tests.

---

## 1. What is the overall structure of tests in GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is based on the xUnit testing framework architecture, organizing tests into `Test Suites` and `Test Cases`:

- **Test Suites:** Group related tests logically, often by the feature or class under test.
- **Test Cases:** Individual tests that verify specific behaviors or conditions within the suite.

This structure helps you logically arrange tests and enables selective execution and reporting.

### Example
```cpp
TEST(MathUtils, HandlesPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);
}

TEST(MathUtils, HandlesNegativeNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(-1, -2), -3);
}
```

Here, `MathUtils` is the test suite, and each `TEST` is a test case.

## 2. How does GoogleTest discover and run tests?

GoogleTest uses static registration via macros such as `TEST` and `TEST_F` to register each test case at compile time. When you run your test executable, GoogleTest:

- Iterates over all registered tests
- Runs each test in isolation
- Reports results clearly indicating success or failure with details

This means you only need to write tests; no extra discovery steps are required.

## 3. What is the difference between parameterized and typed tests?

GoogleTest supports advanced testing styles to cover various input scenarios efficiently:

- **Parameterized Tests:** Allow you to run the same test logic with different data values. Useful when behavior depends on different inputs.

  ```cpp
  class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};
  TEST_P(FactorialTest, Computes) {
    int n = GetParam();
    EXPECT_GE(Factorial(n), 1);
  }
  INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveNumbers, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 4));
  ```

- **Typed Tests:** Let you run the same set of tests for multiple types, ideal for generic or templated code.

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  class MyContainerTest : public ::testing::Test {};
  TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyContainerTest, MyTypes);
  TYPED_TEST(MyContainerTest, CanAddElements) {
    TypeParam obj;
    obj.Add(...);
    EXPECT_TRUE(obj.HasElements());
  }
  ```

These features reduce duplication and improve test coverage.

## 4. What types of assertions does GoogleTest provide?

GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertions to verify program correctness:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: Abort the current test immediately if the condition fails. Use when continuing makes no sense.

- **Non-fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: Report the failure but continue running the test, useful to gather multiple failures in one run.

- **Death Assertions (`EXPECT_DEATH`, `ASSERT_DEATH`)**: Verify that code terminates as expected (e.g., crashes on invalid inputs).

- **Predicate Assertions (`ASSERT_PRED*`, `EXPECT_PRED*`)**: Test arbitrary Boolean predicates.

- **Matcher-based Assertions (`EXPECT_THAT`)**: Use matchers for expressive validation of values and collections.

### Example
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(result.size(), 3);
EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(result));
EXPECT_THAT(names, ::testing::Contains("Alice"));
```

## 5. How do GoogleMock's core features enhance testing?

GoogleMock provides powerful mocking capabilities integrated tightly with GoogleTest, enabling:

- **Declarative Mock Class Creation:** Using macros like `MOCK_METHOD` to easily mock interfaces.

- **Setting Expectations:** Specify which mock methods must be called, how many times, with what arguments, and in which order using `EXPECT_CALL`.

- **Controlling Behavior:** Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior for mocked methods without setting strict expectations.

- **Using Matchers and Actions:** Match arguments and specify return values, side effects, and conditional behaviors.

- **Mock Strictness Options:** Choose between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control how uninteresting calls are handled.

### Usage Overview
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetBar, (), (override));
};

TEST(TestSuite, UsesMock) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetBar())
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(Return(42));

  int val = SomeFunctionUsingFoo(&mock);
  EXPECT_EQ(val, 42);
}
```

## 6. How do GoogleTest and GoogleMock features interoperate?

GoogleMock's mocking features complement GoogleTest's assertions and test discovery by ensuring:

- Test code can isolate dependencies with mocks.
- Mocks verify their expectations automatically during test lifecycle.
- Assertions validate mock outcomes and behaviors.
- Parameterized and typed tests can include mocks seamlessly.

This design results in robust, maintainable, and fast unit tests allowing intricate verification of interactions and state.

## 7. What are best practices when using these core features?

- **Set Expectations Before Use:** Always call `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising the code that uses the mock.
- **Avoid Over-specification:** Only specify argument matchers and call counts as strictly as necessary.
- **Use Parameterized Tests for Variations:** When multiple inputs are to be tested, prefer parameterized tests.
- **Use Appropriate Assertion Type:** Use fatal assertions for critical checks that should block progress; non-fatal for logging multiple test failures.
- **Suppress Uninteresting Calls Wisely:** Utilize `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls when they are expected by design.

## 8. What to do if I encounter understanding or applying core features?

- Refer to the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) and [Mocking for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) guides for step-by-step tutorials.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` during test runs to gain insights on expectation matching and mock call flow.
- Review the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for practical recipes and patterns.
- Consult the [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md) and [Actions Reference](reference/actions.md) to customize mocks effectively.

## Additional Tips
- Keep mock definitions close to interfaces you own to avoid brittle tests.
- When testing sequences, use `InSequence` to enforce call order.
- Employ `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for expressive argument checking.

<Tip>
Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock together to gain maximum power in writing tests that are both readable and maintainable. Start with simple tests and progressively utilize parameterization and mocking to cover complex behaviors.
