# Upgrading and Compatibility Questions

This guide provides clear, practical guidance to help users transition smoothly between different versions of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It outlines key compatibility considerations such as the requirement for C++17 in recent releases, compiler and platform support updates, and common pitfalls to avoid when upgrading or integrating with legacy codebases. This documentation is designed to empower you to upgrade confidently while maintaining your existing test infrastructure.

---

## 1. Overview of Version Compatibility

Upgrading GoogleTest and GoogleMock requires understanding the minimum requirements and breaking changes introduced in newer versions. Recent major releases have standardized on C++17, which impacts compiler versions and build environments.

- **Minimum C++ Standard:** GoogleTest 1.17.x and later require C++17. Attempting to build with older standards will result in compilation failures.
- **Compiler Support:** Ensure your compiler version fully supports C++17 features. Commonly supported compilers include GCC 7+, Clang 5+, and MSVC 2017 Update 3+.
- **Build Tools:** Verify your build tools (CMake, Bazel) are compatible with the required C++ standard and GoogleTest requirements.

<Tip>
Before upgrading, verify your toolchain against the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) document.
</Tip>

## 2. Major Breaking Changes and Migration Notes

### C++17 Standard Enforcement

GoogleTest now requires compiling with C++17 or newer. Because of this:

- Legacy projects using older C++ standards must upgrade their project settings first.
- Some compiler-specific flags or macros related to older standards may need removal.

### Test Macros and API Changes

While most test macros and APIs remain stable, check for:

- Any deprecated macros/features used in your tests that may have been removed.
- Changes in default behavior for test discovery or test filtering that may subtly impact your workflows.

### Fixture and Typed Test Suites

Ensure:

- Test suites using type-parameterized and value-parameterized tests comply with API expectations as defined in recent releases.
- Deprecated usage patterns (such as mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same suite) are updated to avoid test failures.

### GoogleMock Integration

- If using GoogleMock, confirm that your mock classes and expectations conform to any updated patterns â€” especially around mock strictness and expectation verification.
- Integration projects may need to adapt linkage or initialization calls, aligning with changes in `InitGoogleTest()` and `InitGoogleMock()` routines.

<Warning>
Do not mix binary artifacts built with different versions of GoogleTest or GoogleMock, as ABI incompatibilities can cause runtime failures or crashes.
</Warning>

## 3. Upgrading Workflow

Follow this structured approach to ensure a smooth upgrade:

<Steps>
<Step title="Assess Current Environment">
Review your existing compiler versions, build flags, and dependencies to confirm C++17 readiness.
</Step>
<Step title="Update Build Configuration">
Modify your build system (CMakeLists.txt, Bazel BUILD files) to enforce the C++17 standard and update linking against the latest GoogleTest libraries.
</Step>
<Step title="Sync Test Sources">
Adjust test fixtures, parameterized tests, and mock classes to address any new API requirements or deprecations.
</Step>
<Step title="Replace Deprecated Patterns">
Audit test suites for improper use of mixed test macros or namespaces, and revise as necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Rebuild and Validate">
Compile your test binaries fully and run all tests to identify and fix failures related to upgrade.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Golden Outputs or Baseline Comparisons">
If available, compare test outputs against known good baselines to confirm test results are consistent post-upgrade.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use the [googletest-output-test-golden-lin.txt](./googletest/test/googletest-output-test-golden-lin.txt) as a reference example of expected test output structure and possible failure messages.
</Tip>

## 4. Common Issues and How to Resolve Them

### Compilation Failures Due to C++ Standard

Verify that your compiler and build system use `-std=c++17` or equivalent. In CMake, set:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

### Linker Errors

- Ensure all GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries linked use the same version.
- Confirm that `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` libraries are linked correctly if your test executables rely on them.

### Test Failures Related to Fixture Mismatch

GoogleTest enforces test fixtures strictly. Avoid:

- Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros in the same test suite.
- Using different fixtures with the same suite name.

Resolve by renaming or reorganizing tests appropriately.

### Deprecated or Changed APIs

Refer to the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) and [Mocking Framework Docs](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/docs/README.md) for any API changes.

## 5. Best Practices for Upgrading

- **Incremental Upgrade:** Upgrade dependencies and build flags incrementally. First, move to C++17 standard without changing GoogleTest version, then upgrade GoogleTest.

- **Continuous Integration:** Use automated test runners like `gtest-parallel` or CI pipelines to catch regressions early.

- **Backup Baselines:** Keep previous test outputs and build snapshots to compare and identify unexpected changes.

- **Consult Change Logs:** Review release notes and [breaking changes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed upgrade guidance.

- **Community Support:** When upgrading complex projects, leverage community forums and GitHub issues to resolve tricky compatibility problems.

If you encounter any upgrade-specific challenges not resolved by this guide, consider consulting detailed troubleshooting guides or reaching out on the GoogleTest community forums.


<Check>
Verify all tests compile and run successfully after upgrading.
Confirm that test failures are actual regressions, not caused by setup or build mismatches.
Keep your dependencies and toolchains consistent to avoid ABI conflicts.
