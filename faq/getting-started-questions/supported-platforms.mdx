# Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

This page provides detailed information about the officially supported operating systems, compilers, and versions aligned with Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. It explains the platforms and compiler environments where GoogleTest and GoogleMock are fully supported, highlights notable limitations, and points users to the current canonical support matrix.

## Overview of Supported Platforms

GoogleTest adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to ensure consistent support and maintenance across a wide range of environments. The policy mandates support for specific compiler versions and platform releases to guarantee conformance with modern C++ standards and robust runtime behavior.

The set of supported platforms includes major desktop and server operating systems where GoogleTest is actively tested and used. This includes:

- **Linux distributions** — modern, actively maintained versions
- **Windows** — including desktop, MinGW, and Windows Store apps
- **macOS and iOS** — supported Apple system versions
- **BSD variants** — like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFlyBSD

For the precise, up-to-date list of supported OS versions and compilers, please consult the official [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

<Tip>
The support matrix is continuously updated to reflect newly validated versions and deprecations. Always refer to the matrix when planning new integrations or troubleshooting platform-specific issues.

## Compiler Support and Requirements

### Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires a compilation environment with full support for **C++17 or later**. Attempts to build with older standards will fail due to the use of modern language features.

This requirement ensures:

- Safe usage of language constructs and standard library features.
- Compatibility with current and future compiler advancements.

### Supported Compiler Families and Versions

GoogleTest and GoogleMock officially support a range of compilers on supported platforms, including:

- **GCC:** Versions that fully support C++17 (generally GCC 7.0 and above)
- **Clang:** Versions supporting C++17 features and associated extensions
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++):** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
- **Intel LLVM:** Supported with appropriate C++17 capabilities
- **Other compilers:** IBM VisualAge, SunPro C++, HP aCC, and others, following the policy

The CMake build system provided with GoogleTest sets flags and configurations that assume the compiler meets these requirements. Building with unsupported compiler versions will result in compilation errors during the C++17 language checks and macro definitions.

<Tip>
To enforce C++17 support, GoogleTest includes a static check:

```cpp
#if defined(_MSVC_LANG)
#define GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG _MSVC_LANG
#elif defined(__cplusplus)
#define GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG __cplusplus
#endif

#if !defined(GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG) || \
    GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG < 201703L
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
#endif
```

Ensure your compiler is configured correctly with the `-std=c++17` (or equivalent) flag before building.
</Tip>

### Special Compiler Notes

- **MSVC:** Minimum supported version is Visual Studio 2017 Update 3. For dynamic runtime linkage compatibility, the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` can be enabled.
- **MinGW:** Pthreads support is not present; GoogleTest uses Windows threading primitives.
- **Cross-compilation:** When cross-compiling, careful configuration is needed for pkg-config and sysroot paths (see `docs/pkgconfig.md`).

## Platform Feature Detection and Adaptation

GoogleTest includes extensive platform detection code that configures feature flags at compile time. This automatic detection flags availability for threading, exceptions, RTTI, file system presence, and stream redirection capabilities based on platform and compiler macros.

Key platform macros include:

- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and specific variants like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP` or `GTEST_OS_LINUX_ANDROID`.
- Feature flags such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`, and `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`.

This intelligent configuration enables GoogleTest to support multi-threading, death tests, console output capture, and other features in supported environments while gracefully disabling incompatible features.

<Note>
If your platform or compiler isn't recognized correctly or lacks required features, you can manually override these macros during compilation, e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.
</Note>

## Build System Integration Tips

- **CMake:** GoogleTest provides comprehensive CMake scripts to manage compiler flags, platform-dependent settings, and linking behaviors. The CMake module automatically detects pthread support and sets appropriate compile flags.
- **Pkg-config:** For non-CMake build systems, pkg-config files assist in acquiring the correct include paths, defines, and libraries.

See [Using GoogleTest from various build systems](docs/pkgconfig.md) for detailed examples and guidance on environment variables and cross-compilation.

## Platform Limitations and Compatibility Advice

While GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms, some environments exhibit limitations:

- Mobile and embedded platforms (e.g., Windows Phone, ESP8266, Xtensa) might not support stream redirection or file system features fully.
- Limited or no support for exceptions or RTTI may require tailored build configurations.
- MinGW does not support pthreads; threading support uses native Windows APIs.
- Certain legacy or non-mainstream operating systems may have community-level support only.

Consult the platform-specific sections in [Platform-Specific Test Guidance](guides/integration-solutions/platform-guides) and [System Requirements](getting-started/installation-prerequisites/system-requirements) for detailed advice.

<Tip>
GoogleTest is actively maintained and tested primarily on mainstream desktop and server platforms. If you encounter issues on less common platforms, you are encouraged to report them or contribute fixes upstream.
