# What platforms and compilers are supported?

This page clarifies which platforms and compilers GoogleTest supports, highlights known platform-specific nuances, and links to support policies to help you understand compatibility and limitations clearly. Ensuring your development environment matches supported configurations will enable smooth integration and usage of GoogleTest.

---

## Supported Platforms and Environments

GoogleTest is designed to work across a wide variety of platforms and compilers, adhering to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). It is guaranteed to work on major desktop operating systems and many others, with specific support details as follows.

### Supported Operating Systems

- **Windows**
  - Desktop editions
  - MinGW environments
  - Windows Store Apps (WinRT)
  - Partial support on Windows Mobile and Phone
- **macOS and iOS**
  - macOS desktop
  - iOS devices
- **Linux and Linux-based systems**
  - Standard Linux distributions
  - Android support included with API-level considerations
- **BSD Variants**
  - FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD
- **Others**
  - Sun Solaris
  - AIX
  - Fuchsia
  - GNU Hurd and kFreeBSD
  - QNX
  - Haiku
  - z/OS

GoogleTest detects the platform automatically using predefined macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`), enabling platform-specific features and configurations where supported.

### Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a C++17 compatible compiler. Supported compilers include:

- **GCC:** Version 5.0 or later
- **Clang:** Version 3.4.1 or later
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC):** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later, minimum VS 2015 required for Google Mock
- **Intel C++ Compiler (ICC)** supporting C++17
- **Sun Pro C++ Compiler**
- **IBM VisualAge C++** (limited support)

### Compiler Language and Feature Requirements

- **C++ Standard:** C++17 or newer is required to build and use GoogleTest. The build scripts and `gtest-port.h` enforce this minimum.
- **Exception Handling:** GoogleTest supports both exception-enabled and exception-disabled builds, with automatic detection and macro control (e.g., `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`).
- **RTTI:** Runtime Type Information (RTTI) support is detected automatically. GoogleTest uses RTTI when available but can disable it gracefully when not present.
- **Threading:** GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms supporting threading APIs such as pthreads on UNIX-like systems and native Windows threading primitives.

### Build System Integration

Typical usage occurs in environments using CMake or Bazel, with GoogleTest providing build scripts that detect and adapt to platform/compiler specifics. For users integrating GoogleTest into their projects, leveraging these build systems simplifies platform management.

## Known Platform-Specific Quirks and Notes

### Windows Notes

- When building with MSVC, `gtest_force_shared_crt` can be defined to align runtime libraries dynamically with your project, avoiding linker mismatches.
- The macro `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` should be defined when linking against a shared GoogleTest DLL.
- GoogleTest disables certain deprecated MSVC warnings internally but additional project-specific tweaking may be required.

### Linux and Android Notes

- On Android, support depends on API level, particularly for features like clone(2) system call and POSIX regex support.
- Multithreaded tests require optionally specifying pthread linking if your build system or environment does not detect it automatically.

### macOS and iOS Notes

- GoogleTest supports macOS and iOS, but death tests and certain stream redirections may behave differently on iOS due to platform sandboxing.

### Other Platforms

- Support for less common platforms (e.g., Haiku, z/OS, QNX) is included but may be less complete or subject to platform-specific limitations.
- Embedded platforms such as ESP8266 or Xtensa have limited feature availability, reflected in restricted filesystem or threading support.

### Feature Macros You Can Check

GoogleTest exposes macros that indicate platform and feature availability. These are defined after including `<gtest/gtest.h>` or internally in the porting headers.

Some key macros you can use in your test code:

| Macro                        | Description                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`            | Compiled on Windows                             |
| `GTEST_OS_LINUX`              | Compiled on Linux                               |
| `GTEST_OS_MAC`                | Compiled on macOS                               |
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`           | POSIX pthreads available                         |
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`        | Exceptions enabled                              |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`              | RTTI available                                  |
| `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`        | Death test support enabled                       |
| `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`       | `std::wstring` supported                         |
| `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`| Stream redirection supported for output capture|

Use these macros to write portable tests that adapt to platform capabilities.

## How to Verify Platform and Compiler Support

After including the `<gtest/gtest.h>` header, you can write simple static asserts or checks using the macros described above:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  #if GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE
    std::cout << "GoogleTest is thread-safe on this platform." << std::endl;
  #else
    std::cout << "GoogleTest is NOT thread-safe on this platform." << std::endl;
  #endif

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This clarifies at compile or runtime key feature availability.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always build with a C++17-compliant compiler to ensure compatibility.
- When using shared libraries, define the appropriate GoogleTest macros for shared linking.
- Leverage CMake or Bazel integration to minimize manual configuration and enable automatic detection of platform features.
- Use platform feature macros to make your tests portable and robust.
- Consult known issues for your platform in the project's issue tracker and FAQ.

## Troubleshooting Common Support-Related Issues

- **Build Failures due to Incompatible Compiler Versions:** Upgrade to a compiler version supporting C++17.

- **Threading or Exception Handling Errors:** Confirm that pthreads is enabled where expected and that exception macros align with compiler settings.

- **Linker Errors on Windows:** Check that runtime libraries match between your project and GoogleTest (e.g., static vs shared CRT).

- **Missing Features on Embedded or Niche Platforms:** Some advanced GoogleTest features, like death tests or wide string support, may not be available.
