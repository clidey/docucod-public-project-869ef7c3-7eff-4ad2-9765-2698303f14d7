# What platforms, compilers, and language versions are supported?

This FAQ page addresses common questions about the compatibility of GoogleTest and GoogleMock with various operating systems, compilers, and C++ language versions. It clarifies supported environments, minimum requirements, how to verify compatibility, and common scenarios encountered during porting.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms, following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Its core support is most stable and thoroughly tested on major desktop and server platforms:

- **Linux (including Android)**
- **Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Visual Studio)**
- **macOS and iOS**

Additional platforms supported, sometimes with varying levels of stability:

- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- AIX
- HP-UX
- Solaris
- Cygwin
- Fuchsia
- Native Client (NaCl)
- Others (QNX, DragonFlyBSD, GNU/Hurd, Haiku, and embedded systems such as ESP32 and ESP8266)

GoogleTest automatically detects the current platform through predefined macros, and adjusts feature availability accordingly.


## Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require modern C++ compilers that support the C++17 standard ([ISO/IEC 14882:2017](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17)). Minimum supported compiler versions include:

- GCC 7.0 or later
- Clang 5.0 or later
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or later

Other compilers meeting the C++17 standard can also be compatible, but support for some advanced language and platform features may differ.

### Key Compatibility Points

- GoogleTest enforces a minimum of **C++17**.
- Attempts to compile with older C++ standards will fail with an error like:

  ```
  #error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
  ```

- MSVC requires at least version 1911 (VS 2017 Update 3) for GoogleMock.

- Exceptions are optionally supported; GoogleTest detects and adapts to whether your build enables C++ exceptions.

- RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) is detected automatically, with GoogleTest adjusting functionality accordingly.


## How to Check Support for Your Environment

GoogleTest uses platform-specific macros internally to enable or disable features depending on your OS, compiler, and system capabilities. You can verify your environment as follows:

- **Check C++ Standard Version:** Ensure your project or build environment specifies the C++17 standard or later.

- **Identify Platform Macros:** GoogleTest defines macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, et al., that indicate detected platforms.

- **Compiler Version:** Use your compiler's version command:
  - GCC: `g++ --version`
  - Clang: `clang++ --version`
  - MSVC: Check Visual Studio version or run `cl.exe` with `/?

- **Exceptions and RTTI:** GoogleTest internally detects these features, but your build system should explicitly enable exceptions and RTTI if your tests require them.

- **Threading Support:** Platforms with POSIX threads or Windows threading APIs enable thread-safe GoogleTest features automatically.

- **File System & Stream Redirection:** Most platforms with file system support enable all GoogleTest features including death tests and output capture.


## Common Porting Scenarios

### Porting to a New Platform

- Verify your compiler supports C++17.
- Confirm platform macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_*`) are defined properly or consider defining them in a custom porting header.
- Check feature macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` to verify system capabilities.

### Embedded or Limited Environments

- Some embedded platforms or limited OSes may not support exceptions, RTTI, or file systems.
- GoogleTest disables unsupported features automatically but may limit test coverage (e.g., death tests won't work).

### Compiler Flags

- Ensure the compilation flags enable C++17 with:
  - GCC/Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - MSVC: `/std:c++17`
- Enable exceptions (`-fexceptions` or equivalent) if your tests expect exception support.

### Linking & ABI Compatibility

- Use consistent standard library and ABI versions between your code and GoogleTest libraries.
- For example, don't mix GoogleTest built with an older standard library ABI with your application compiled with a newer ABI.


## Summary Table: Key Requirements

| Component                | Requirement                                    |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **C++ Standard**         | Minimum C++17                                  |
| **GCC**                  | 7.0+                                          |
| **Clang**                | 5.0+                                          |
| **MSVC**                 | Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (1911) or greater |
| **Supported OSes**       | Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, BSD variants, and more   |
| **Exceptions Support**   | Optional; detected automatically               |
| **RTTI Support**         | Required for some GoogleTest features; detected automatically |
| **Threading**            | POSIX threads or Windows thread API required for thread-safe features |
| **File System**          | Required for death tests and output capture    |


## Practical Tips

- Always update your compiler to a supported version before integrating GoogleTest.
- Verify C++17 standard compliance explicitly in your build system.
- If your platform is new or non-standard, consider contributing patches or custom porting headers.
- Check GoogleTest macros via preprocessor output or debugger to confirm detected environment.


## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Compatibility Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Compilation fails with C++ version errors">
If you encounter errors about missing C++17 support, verify your compiler and build flags enforce C++17 or newer. On GCC and Clang, use `-std=c++17`. On MSVC, use `/std:c++17`.

If the compiler does not support C++17, upgrade it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported platform or missing macros">
GoogleTest defines platform macros automatically. If you build on an uncommon platform, GoogleTest may not recognize it fully. You may need to create a custom port header to define platform macros appropriately.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime failures related to threading or files">
Ensure your OS and compiler support required threading APIs and filesystem calls for thread safety and death test features. On embedded or mobile platforms, some features may be disabled.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker errors with GoogleMock on MSVC">
Ensure your MSVC version is at least 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11). Older MSVC compilers are not supported for GoogleMock.
</Accordion>

### Example: Checking Compiler Version on Linux

```bash
$ g++ --version
g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0

$ g++ -std=c++17 -c my_test.cpp
```

If the compiler supports C++17 and compiles without errors, you meet the minimum language requirement.

---

### Example: Minimal CMakeLists.txt for Required C++ Version

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyTestProject LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(runTests test.cpp)
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(runTests GTest::gtest_main)
```

This ensures the compiler uses C++17 when building your tests with GoogleTest.

### Conclusion

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of platforms and compilers, but to use them effectively, your environment must meet the baseline C++17 standard and be based on supported compiler versions and operating systems. Understanding and verifying these requirements upfront ensures a smooth integration and testing experience with GoogleTest.
