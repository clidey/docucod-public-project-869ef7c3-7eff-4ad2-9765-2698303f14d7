# Support & Bug Reporting

This page offers clear, actionable guidance on where and how to obtain technical assistance, report issues, and connect with the GoogleTest and GoogleMock community. If you encounter bugs, need help troubleshooting, or want to understand the official policies on issue reporting, this is your starting point.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where Can I Find Official Support?
- **Issue Tracker:** The primary channel to report bugs or feature requests is the [GoogleTest GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues). Use it to create detailed reports so maintainers can respond quickly.
- **Community Forums:** For questions, troubleshooting tips, and advice, leverage community forums such as Stack Overflow with the `googletest` or `googlemock` tags.
- **Documentation:** Extensive official documentation, including guides and references, resides within the GoogleTest repository and website.

### How Do I Report a Bug Effectively?
1. **Verify it’s Not Already Reported:** Search the issue tracker for existing similar issues.
2. **Provide a Minimal Reproducible Example:** Include the smallest code snippet that reproduces the issue.
3. **Include Environment Details:** Specify platform, compiler version, GoogleTest version, and relevant build systems.
4. **Detail Expected vs. Actual Behavior:** Clearly describe what you expect to happen, and what actually happens.
5. **Attach Error Messages and Logs:** Provide any failure outputs or stack traces.

### What Are Community Standards for Reporting?
- Be respectful and professional when interacting with maintainers and other community members.
- Provide precise and complete information to facilitate swift resolution.
- Avoid duplicate reports or vague issues; clarity benefits all.

### Where Can I Get Timely Help?
- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/googletest/discussions) for broader community conversations.
- Join relevant developer groups or chat rooms that focus on C++ testing and mocking.
- Refer to the [Getting Started: Where to Find Help](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting-faq/where-to-find-help.mdx) guide for specific links and resources.

## Common Issues & Gotchas

### Installation and Setup Issues
- Ensure your compiler meets the minimum requirements outlined in the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/prep-requirements-installation/prerequisites-requirements.mdx).
- Follow guidelines on integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock with your build system ([Bazel](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/guides/integration-and-best-practices/build-system-integration.mdx), [CMake](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/guides/integration-and-best-practices/build-system-integration.mdx)).

### Bug Reporting Pitfalls
- Avoid submitting reports without reproducible test code.
- Never include sensitive or proprietary code.
- Keep issue titles concise but descriptive.

### Support Availability
- The project team responds primarily through GitHub Issues.
- Priority is often given to well-documented and reproducible problems.

## Error Messages & Debugging

### Understanding Error Reports
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock produce detailed failure messages including file locations and call stacks.
- Read the error messages carefully to identify expectation mismatches, mock failures, or test assertions.

### Debugging Tips
- Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to see a trace of mock calls and expectations.
- Utilize verbose logging and GoogleTest’s stack trace controls to gain deeper insight.
- When mocks fail, verify both argument matching and call counts.

---

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Systematic Approach
- Start by isolating the problem with minimal test cases.
- Review related expectations, matches, and mocks for correctness.
- Incrementally refine or relax mocks to identify the failure source.

### Verification
- Rerun tests after any fix or workaround.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to force verification before object destruction.

### Prevention Tips
- Design mocks and expectations conservatively to reduce brittleness.
- Use the `ON_CALL` macro to set default mock behaviors instead of overusing `EXPECT_CALL`.
