## How to Report Issues Effectively

When reporting a bug or issue, providing complete, clear, and reproducible information is critical to speed up resolution and get the best assistance:

- **Describe the problem:** Clearly specify the unexpected behavior and how it diverges from expected results.
- **Provide minimal reproducible example:** Share concise code snippets or test cases demonstrating the issue.
- **Include environment details:** Mention compiler, platform, GoogleTest/GoogleMock versions.
- **Error messages and logs:** Attach exact error outputs and stack traces.
- **Steps to reproduce:** Outline how to recreate the problem step by step.

Following this structure saves time for both you and the maintainers and improves the quality of feedback.
