# How to Get Support

This page guides you swiftly to the best resources where you can find help with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you're troubleshooting tricky issues, seeking community advice, or looking to file bug reports, this page points you to documentation, forums, issue trackers, and describes what you can expect in terms of response.

## Where to Find Help

### Official Documentation
The primary source of answers for common questions and detailed guidance is the **official documentation**. Before posting on forums or filing issues, please consult these resources:

- [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) â€“ Get started with writing simple tests.
- [gMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md) â€“ Learn how to create and use mock objects in C++.
- [Mocking Reference](docs/reference/mocking.md) â€“ Detailed API for mocking.
- [Matchers Reference](api-reference/matchers-and-actions/argument-matching.mdx) â€“ Understand argument matching techniques.
- [Actions Reference](api-reference/matchers-and-actions/actions-for-mocks.mdx) â€“ Control mock behaviors.
- [GoogleMock FAQ](docs/gmock_faq.md) â€“ Answers to common mocking pitfalls and questions.
- [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) â€“ Practical recipes and best practices.

Referencing these resources first saves time and helps ensure you understand foundational concepts.

### Community Forums and Q&A
For personalized help, discussion, and advice:

- **Google Test GitHub Discussions**: Engage with developers and users to ask questions and share experiences.
- **Stack Overflow**: Use the tags `googletest` and `gmock` to search past questions or post new ones. When posting, provide minimal reproducible examples.

Engaging in community forums can quickly clarify your issues or highlight known workarounds.

### Issue Tracker and Bug Reports
If you suspect a bug or missing feature in GoogleTest or GoogleMock, use the **GitHub issue tracker** at:

ðŸ”— [GitHub Repository Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

Before submitting an issue:

1. Search the existing issues carefully to avoid duplicates.
2. Include detailed information:
   - Environment and platform details (OS, compiler, versions).
   - Minimal reproducible test case.
   - Exact commands or code triggering the issue.
3. Clearly describe the expected behavior and the actual observed behavior.

Timely and clear reporting helps maintainers prioritize and resolve problems effectively.

## Response Expectations

While GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open-source projects, please keep the following in mind for support and interactions:

- **Community-driven Support**: Much of the support comes from volunteers and contributors. Response times vary.
- **Respect and Clarity**: Clear, respectful communication accelerates help from maintainers and community members.
- **Self-help Encouraged**: Effort to use and understand documentation before seeking help leads to faster resolutions.

## Troubleshooting Workflow

When you encounter issues:

1. **Consult Documentation and FAQs**: Most common issues and guidance are covered in the official docs.
2. **Run Tests with verbose output**: Use flags like `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs about mock interactions.
3. **Search Community Forums**: Others may have experienced the same problem.
4. **Prepare a Minimal Example**: Isolate the problem to the smallest code snippet.
5. **Report Issues or Ask Questions**: Use the issue tracker or forums with all gathered details.

<Tip>
Prepare your problem clearly before seeking support to get the fastest and most accurate assistance.

## Appendix: Initializing Google Mock in Your Tests

If you decide to write your own `main()` for testing, initialize GoogleMock as follows before running tests:

```cpp
#include "gmock/gmock.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This ensures the framework and mocking support are properly set up.

## Troubleshooting Common Access Points

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting and Support Scenarios">
<Accordion title="I have a question about mocking behavior; where should I look first?">
Start with the [gMock FAQ](docs/gmock_faq.md) and the [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md).
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces that can clarify unexpected mock behavior.
If still unclear, prepare a minimal example and ask on GitHub Discussions or Stack Overflow.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="My test is failing with unexpected calls; how can I diagnose?">
Run your tests with the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see which expectations were matched or missed.
Review the exact error message for clues and check the matchers and call orders.
Consult the Mock Object Behaviors documentation to understand "uninteresting" vs "unexpected" calls.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I report a bug in GoogleTest or GoogleMock?">
Before reporting:
- Search existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- Prepare a minimal reproducible test case.
- Include environment, platform, toolchain versions, and precise logs.
Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to file your bug report.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
