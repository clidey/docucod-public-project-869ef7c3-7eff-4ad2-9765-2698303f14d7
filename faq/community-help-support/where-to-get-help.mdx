## When and How to Report Bugs

GoogleTest is a mature and widely used framework, but issues may arise during integration or advanced usage. To ensure your bug report leads to timely resolution:

1. **Verify with Latest Version:** Check against the latest stable or main branch to see if the issue persists.
2. **Check Existing Issues:** Search the GitHub issues list to avoid duplicates.
3. **Provide Minimal Reproducible Example:** Isolate the smallest possible code snippet that triggers the problem.
4. **Include Relevant Environment Details:** OS, compiler, GoogleTest version, build and runtime flags.
