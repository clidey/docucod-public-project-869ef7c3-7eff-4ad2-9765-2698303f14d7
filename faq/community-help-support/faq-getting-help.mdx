# Getting Help and Reporting Problems

This page guides you on how to engage effectively with the GoogleTest and GoogleMock maintainers, report bugs, and access community resources where your questions and issues are addressed. Whether you are facing setup challenges, unexpected test behaviors, or want to contribute, these instructions will help you get the assistance you need efficiently.

## 1. How to Engage with Maintainers

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open source projects actively maintained by Google engineers and contributors worldwide. To interact constructively:

- **Report issues** clearly and concisely via the official GitHub issue tracker.
- **Follow contribution guidelines** when submitting bug reports or pull requests.
- **Provide reproducible examples** to help maintainers understand and fix issues quickly.

Maintainers appreciate detailed feedback and well-structured reports but avoid informal or vague requests in issue comments.

## 2. Reporting Bugs Efficiently

To report bugs that get resolved faster, follow this approach:

### Step-by-step Bug Report Checklist:

1. **Verify your environment:** Confirm your setup is supported by reviewing the [Prerequisites & Supported Platforms](../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/prerequisites-supported-platforms) page.
2. **Reproduce the bug with a minimal test case:** Create a small, self-contained test that demonstrates the problem without extra dependencies.
3. **Check existing issues:** Search the [GoogleTest GitHub issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to avoid duplicates.
4. **Gather diagnostic information:** Include error messages, output logs, and compiler versions.
5. **Write a detailed description:** State what you expected and what actually happened.
6. **Attach code snippets:** Provide relevant snippets or links to repositories showing the problem.

### Example bug report template:

```
### Steps to reproduce
1. Describe the actions that trigger the bug.
2. Provide the minimal code snippet and command lines.

### Expected behavior
What you expected to happen.

### Actual behavior
What actually happened, including error messages.

### Environment
- OS: (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 20.04)
- Compiler and version: (e.g., gcc 9.3.0)
- GoogleTest version: (e.g., main branch or release version)

### Additional context
Any relevant information such as flags, dependencies, or code structure.

<Tip>
When reporting issues or asking questions, including a concise yet complete minimal reproducible example and environment details accelerates diagnosis and resolution.
</Tip>

<Note>
Be mindful that feature requests or broad questions might not receive direct responses. For those, consider community forums or mailing lists.
</Note>

<Warning>
Avoid filing issues without prior research; duplicates waste maintainers' time and delay help.
