# Contributing and Providing Feedback

This page answers common questions about how to contribute fixes, improvements, or new features to GoogleTest, and how to provide feedback to the project maintainers effectively.

## How Can I Contribute to GoogleTest?

GoogleTest welcomes contributions from the community to improve the framework. You can contribute in several ways:

- **Bug Fixes:** Identify issues and submit patches that fix bugs.
- **New Features:** Propose and implement new features enhancing GoogleTestâ€™s capabilities.
- **Documentation Improvements:** Help improve user guides, references, and FAQs to make GoogleTest easier to use.
- **Tests:** Contribute tests that improve coverage and reliability.

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub at https://github.com/google/googletest.
2. **Clone your fork** locally and create a new branch for your change.
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages following the project style.
4. **Run all tests** to ensure your changes did not introduce regressions.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** with a detailed description that explains the purpose of the change.

Maintainers will review your PR, may ask for clarifications or improvements, and then merge it if it meets quality and compatibility standards.

<Tip>
Be sure your contributions adhere to the Google C++ Style Guide and ensure your code compiles cleanly under supported platforms and compilers.

## How Do I Suggest Improvements or Report Issues?

If you have ideas for improvements or encounter issues:

- Use the **GitHub Issues** page of the GoogleTest repository for bug reports or feature requests.
- Provide a **clear description** of the problem or suggestion.
- Include relevant **details**, such as:
  - Platform and compiler used.
  - GoogleTest version.
  - Minimal reproducible example if reporting a bug.

## How Can I Provide Feedback on Documentation?

Documentation feedback is crucial to help make GoogleTest more user-friendly.

- You can submit documentation improvements through PRs as you would for code contributions.

- When submitting PRs for documentation, please ensure:
  - Clear, concise, and grammatically correct language.
  - Accurate examples and up-to-date content.
  - Adherence to the existing style and formatting.

## What Are The Expectations for Code Contributions?

- **Code Quality:** Contributions should be clean, readable, and maintainable.
- **Compatibility:** Changes must maintain compatibility with officially supported platforms and compiler versions.
- **Tests:** New features and bug fixes must include tests demonstrating correctness.
- **No Breaking Changes:** Major disruptive changes require a design discussion first.

## How Is the Feedback Process Managed?

- Maintainers actively review contributions and issues.
- Community members are encouraged to participate in discussions constructively.
- Feedback, whether via a PR review or issue comment, will be addressed in a timely manner.
- For critical bugs or security issues, there might be a separate reporting process.
