# Contributing & Reporting Issues

Welcome to the Contributing & Reporting Issues guide for GoogleMock. This page walks you through the processes and best practices for submitting bug reports, feature requests, and contributing code to the project. It also outlines the code of conduct and helpful resources to make your contributions smooth and effective.

## 1. Submitting Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Whether you encounter a bug or have a new feature idea, submitting clear and actionable reports helps maintainers address issues quickly and prioritize work effectively.

### How to Submit a Bug Report

- **Provide a clear description**: Summarize the issue concisely and state what you expected versus what happened.
- **Include steps to reproduce**: Offer a minimal code example or sequence that reliably triggers the problem.
- **Specify environment details**: Such as compiler version, platform, GoogleMock version, and any relevant flags or configurations.
- **Attach logs or error messages**: Copy-paste exact error outputs or logs. If failing tests produce output, include them.

### How to Submit a Feature Request

- **Describe the feature clearly**: Explain the problem it solves and typical use cases.
- **Suggest API or usage**: Propose how the feature might look or be used.
- **Mention possible alternatives**: If relevant, describe existing workarounds or related features.

### Platform for Reporting

Use the [GoogleTest GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to submit both bug reports and feature requests.

<Tip>
Good bug and feature reports accelerate resolution and help the community. Including minimal reproducible examples encourages faster fixes.
</Tip>

### Code of Conduct

- **Be respectful and collaborative**: Follow the community’s code of conduct fostering constructive communication.
- **Follow style guidelines**: Align your contributions with the existing style and architecture to maintain consistency.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
2. **Set up your environment** according to the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/prerequisites-requirements.md).
3. **Create a feature branch** on your fork.
4. **Make changes** and ensure you add tests where applicable.
5. **Run tests** including GoogleMock’s own test suite (`RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is used in main).
6. **Submit a pull request (PR)** following the contribution guidelines.

### Writing Tests for Your Contributions

- Use GoogleMock’s existing style for mock classes and expectations.
- Include unit tests, showing the feature or bug fix in action.
- Ensure tests run and pass reliably across supported platforms.

### Review and Merge Process

- Monitor CI systems associated with your PR.
- Respond to review comments constructively.
- Only merge after approvals and successful checks.

<Note>
GoogleMock’s design encourages gradual contributions; start small — even documentation improvements count!
