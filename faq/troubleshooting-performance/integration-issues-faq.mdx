# Integration Troubleshooting

A comprehensive reference to resolving common issues encountered when adopting and integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your C++ projects. This page focuses exclusively on problems related to build systems (such as CMake and Bazel), linker errors, header conflicts, and test discovery challenges.

---

## 1. Common Integration Issues

### 1.1 Build Tool Problems

**Symptom:** Failure when incorporating GoogleTest into your build with CMake or Bazel.

**Causes & Solutions:**

- **Incorrect Linking:** Ensure you link your test target against the correct GoogleTest libraries (`gtest` or `gtest_main`). For simple cases, linking with `gtest_main` provides an entry point and eliminates the need to write a main function.

- **Missing Dependencies:** Verify that the GoogleTest source or precompiled libraries are properly included and your build files reference them correctly.

- **Use of Macros:** When mocking classes or writing tests, use the macros exactly as documented, avoiding manual declarations that may cause linker problems.

- **C++ Standards:** Confirm your build environment uses at least C++17, the minimum standard supported by GoogleTest.

<Tip>
Always consult the [Configuring Your Project](https://docs/getting-started/installation-configuration/project-setup) guide for detailed steps on incorporating GoogleTest with CMake or Bazel.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Linker Errors

**Symptom:** Undefined references to GoogleTest or GoogleMock symbols during linking.

**Root Causes:**

- Library not linked: Add the necessary link targets `-lgtest` and/or `-lgmock`.
- Missing source files: Using the bundled GoogleTest means including source files (`.cc`) or linking against compiled libraries.

**Verification Steps:**

1. Check your build script links with GoogleTest libraries.
2. If compiling GoogleTest as part of your project, ensure source files like `gtest-all.cc` or `gmock-all.cc` are included.
3. Avoid mixing different versions of GoogleTest or GoogleMock binaries.

<Warning>
Do not mix header-only includes with precompiled GoogleTest libraries compiled with different compiler options.
</Warning>

### 1.3 Header Conflicts and Missing Includes

**Symptom:** Compiler errors related to missing headers or conflicting declarations.

**Analysis & Remedies:**

- Make sure to always include `<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files as appropriate.
- When mocking, `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` suffices, as it transitively includes GoogleTest.
- If encountering issues in templates or with `std` types, ensure you wrap complex template parameters in parentheses as per [`MOCK_METHOD` usage](https://docs/reference/mocking-framework/defining-mocks).

### 1.4 Test Discovery Problems

**Symptom:** Your tests don’t run or GoogleTest reports no tests found.

**Probable Causes:**

- You didn't call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.
- Tests defined with macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` are in source files not compiled or linked into the binary.
- Using incompatible macros/methods or incorrect test suite/test names.

<Tip>
Add logging or use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to confirm which tests GoogleTest finds.
</Tip>

## 2. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Build Linkage">
Ensure that your target links against the relevant GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries or includes their source files.

Check for lines such as:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE gtest gmock)
```

or equivalent Bazel dependencies.

</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Include Paths">
Verify that your compiler’s include paths can locate GoogleTest headers, and your test files include the necessary headers (`<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>`).
</Step>
<Step title="Check `main()` and Test Initialization">
Make sure you call:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Or link against `gtest_main` to avoid writing your own main.
</Step>
<Step title="Run with Debug Flags">
Use GoogleTest flags such as:

- `--gtest_list_tests` to list recognized tests.
- `--gtest_filter=*` to explicitly run all tests.

This helps to verify test discovery and execution flow.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Mock Class Definitions and Qualifiers">
Incorrect `MOCK_METHOD` usage can lead to compilation or linkage errors.

- Wrap argument types with commas in parentheses.
- Add qualifiers like `(const, override)` exactly when overriding const methods.

Refer to [Mocking Reference](https://docs/reference/mocking-framework/defining-mocks) for details.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Do not mix GoogleTest versions** in the same build; compile/link all parts from the same version.
- **Mock destructors and non-virtual methods:** Ensure interfaces have virtual destructors when mocking.
- **Avoid unchecked expectations:** Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` where calls must be verified.
- **Control uninteresting calls** using `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers to reduce noise or enforce strictness.

<Note>
See the [Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks](https://docs/api-reference/mocking-framework/nice-strict-mocks) documentation for adjusting mock strictness.
</Note>

- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations that shouldn't remain active after being hit, avoiding confusing upper bounds errors.
- When returning move-only types (like `std::unique_ptr`), prefer lambdas in `WillOnce()` or `WillRepeatedly()` for safety.

## 4. Troubleshooting Linker and Compile Errors

<AccordionGroup title="Linker Errors">
<Accordion title="Undefined reference to gtest symbols">
  Ensure linking with `gtest` and that compatible versions are used.

  Consider compiling `gtest-all.cc` into your project.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicting symbols or multiply defined symbols">
  Conflicts happen when GoogleTest sources are linked multiple times or mixed with precompiled versions.
  Avoid multiple definitions by proper CMake target usage.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup title="Compilation Issues">
<Accordion title="Template or Macro Usage Errors with MOCK_METHOD">
  Complex argument types require wrapping arguments containing commas in parentheses.

  Ensure proper specifiers like `const`, `override`, and `noexcept` are used.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Headers or Include Errors">
  Verify that include paths are correct and that the correct headers (`gtest/gtest.h` and `gmock/gmock.h`) are included in test files.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Test Discovery & Execution Issues

- Confirm test functions use the correct macros: `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` as appropriate.
- Make sure that source files defining tests are built and linked.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` run flag to see all discovered tests.
- Mismatched test names or missing fixture definitions result in no tests found.

<Tip>
If using parameterized tests (`TEST_P`), don't forget to instantiate the test cases with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
</Tip>

---

## 6. Advanced Tips for Integration

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` *before* exercising the code under test; setting expectations afterward leads to undefined behavior.
- For continuous integration workflows, generate test reports using GoogleTest flags like `--gtest_output=xml:report.xml`.
- Troubleshoot verbose output using `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock call matching.

## 7. Getting Help

- Consult [Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues](https://docs/getting-started/first-test-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) for installation barriers.
- Review [Setting Expectations and Actions in Mocks](https://docs/api-reference/mocking-framework/expectations-actions) to better understand mock setup.
- Engage with community forums and check the GoogleTest GitHub repository for issue tracking.
