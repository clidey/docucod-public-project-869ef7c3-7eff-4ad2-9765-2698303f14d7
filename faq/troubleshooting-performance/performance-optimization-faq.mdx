# Optimizing Test Performance

This page offers actionable advice to accelerate your test execution and optimize resource usage in GoogleTest. You'll learn how to run tests in parallel, reduce test dependencies, and leverage value/type parameterized tests effectively — all geared towards speeding up your test suite while maintaining reliability.

## 1. Running Tests in Parallel

One of the most effective ways to speed up test suites is to run tests in parallel. GoogleTest supports parallel test execution out of the box.

### How to run tests in parallel

Run your test binary with the `--jobs=N` flag, where `N` is the number of test processes to run concurrently. For example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --jobs=8
```

This command runs up to 8 test processes simultaneously, distributing test cases across them for faster overall completion.

### Best Practices

- **Match parallelism to your hardware:** Set `N` to the number of CPU cores or threads available.
- **Isolate tests:** Ensure tests are independent and do not share global state or filesystem resources that could cause contention or flaky results.
- **Use test sharding:** When using CI pipelines, shard tests into subsets that run in parallel across agents.

### Common pitfalls

- Tests that have hidden dependencies or state can cause intermittent failures in parallel runs.
- Resource-heavy tests might saturate system resources; in this case, reduce `N`.

<Tip>
Parallel test execution drastically reduces the wall-clock time for large test suites, but requires that tests be designed to run independently without subtle interference.
</Tip>

## 2. Minimizing Test Dependencies

Complex or tightly-coupled tests run slower and are harder to maintain. Optimizing test dependencies improves speed and reduces resource consumption.

### Strategies for minimizing dependencies

- **Focus on unit tests:** Prefer tests that exercise a small, focused unit of code without dependence on databases, file systems, or networks.
- **Use mocks and fakes:** Replace expensive dependencies with mocks or fake implementations (see the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)).
- **Avoid global initialization:** Keep test setup lightweight and local to each test case.
- **Run setup/teardown only when necessary:** Share fixtures only among tests that truly require the same expensive setup.

### Real-world example

If you have a test suite that queries a database, mock the database access layer. This allows your test to focus on logic without waiting on network calls, significantly speeding up test runs.

<Note>
Tests that depend on external resources tend to be slower and more brittle, reducing the overall efficiency of test execution.
</Note>

## 3. Using Value-Parameterized and Typed Tests Effectively

Parametrized tests let you run the same test logic with various inputs efficiently, saving code and enabling comprehensive coverage.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

Value-parameterized tests let you define a test once and supply a set of values it runs against.

#### Example:

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ReturnsExpected) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), ExpectedFactorial(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveNumbers, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 10));
```

This runs the same `FactorialTest` with each parameter value, avoiding duplicate test code.

### Typed Tests

Typed tests allow a single test template to run with multiple types, enhancing test reuse for templated code.

#### Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericLimitsTest : public ::testing::Test {};

typedef ::testing::Types<int, float, double> NumericTypes;

TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericLimitsTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericLimitsTest, IsSigned) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(std::numeric_limits<TypeParam>::is_signed);
}
```

### Optimize parameterized tests

- **Limit input sets:** Use thoughtfully chosen parameter values to cover critical cases rather than exhaustive permutations.
- **Avoid expensive test setup:** Keep setup lightweight to prevent amplifying overhead across parameters.
- **Combine with parallelism:** Run parameterized tests in parallel to maximize speed gains.

### Why use parameterized tests?

Using value or typed parameterized tests eliminates redundant test code, reduces maintenance effort, and enables efficient, broad test coverage.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

Even when using best practices, you might encounter slow tests. Here’s how to diagnose and fix common issues.

### Identify bottlenecks

- Profile test execution times to find slow tests.
- Check if tests perform unnecessary work or heavy initialization.

### Reduce test time

- Split slow integrations tests from fast unit tests.
- Disable or limit tests that stress external resources.

### Avoid flakiness in parallel runs

- Inspect if tests share state or resources unsafely.
- Fix or isolate such tests to ensure reliable parallel execution.

## 5. Additional Tips

- Use GoogleTest flags such as `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test order and detect order-dependency issues.
- Apply `ON_CALL` defaults wisely to reduce redundant expectation setup which can slow down tests.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress unimportant warnings, keeping test output clean.
- Set expectations carefully to avoid brittle tests that hinder refactoring and performance optimization.

## Summary

Optimizing your GoogleTest suite’s performance involves parallelizing test runs, reducing dependencies via mocks/fakes, and making smart use of value- and type-parameterized tests to maximize efficiency and test coverage. Always design tests to be isolated, lightweight, and maintainable to unlock the greatest speed gains.
