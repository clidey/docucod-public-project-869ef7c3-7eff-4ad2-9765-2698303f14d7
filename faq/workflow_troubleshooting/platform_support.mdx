# Platform and Compiler Support

This FAQ page addresses common questions regarding the platforms and compilers supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It guides you through verifying your environment, understanding minimum requirements, and troubleshooting compatibility issues to ensure smooth integration and usage.

---

## 1. What platforms does GoogleTest support?

GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms, with the most stable support for Cygwin, Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows desktop environments.

- **Supported Platforms Include:** IBM AIX, Cygwin, DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD, Fuchsia, GNU/Hurd, GNU/kFreeBSD, Haiku, HP-UX, Linux (including Android), Mac OS X (including iOS), NetBSD, OpenBSD, OS/2, QNX, Solaris, Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants), and z/OS.

- **Platform Detection:** GoogleTest automatically detects the platform during compilation using macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`). This detection helps ensure environment-specific features are enabled or disabled appropriately.

- **Note:** Some platforms like Fuchsia are supported but considered less stable due to limited access by maintainers.

> For the latest detailed platform support list, refer to the [Supported Platforms table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## 2. What compilers are supported?

GoogleTest requires a compiler with support for at least the C++17 standard.

- **Minimum C++ Standard:** C++17 or later is mandatory for building GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

- **Compiler Compatibility:** GoogleTest works with many modern compilers such as GCC (version 7+ recommended), Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later), IntelLLVM, SunPro CC, IBM VisualAge, and HP aCC.

- **Special Notes for MSVC:** Visual Studio projects by default link against dynamic runtime libraries, whereas GoogleTest links statically to CRT. To resolve conflicts, configure the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option.

- **Compiler Feature Checks:** Internally, GoogleTest verifies the compiler’s feature set, including exception support, RTTI, and thread safety, and adapts accordingly.

---

## 3. How do I check if my platform and compiler are compatible?

Here is a streamlined user workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Minimum C++ Standard">
Make sure your build environment enforces at least C++17 compilation, for example, by setting `-std=c++17` in GCC or Clang, or `/std:c++17` in MSVC.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Platform Macro Detection">
Review compile-time logs or verbose output to ensure GoogleTest platform macros are correctly detected (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX=1`).
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Compiler Version">
Ensure your compiler version is supported, e.g., MSVC 2017 Update 3 or later. Older versions will fail with clear error messages.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Library Linking & Flags">
If building on Windows, consider enabling `gtest_force_shared_crt` when using CMake to align runtime linkage.
</Step>
</Steps>

> Tip: GoogleTest automatically defines configuration macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` and `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, but you can override these by providing build flags (e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`).

---

## 4. What should I do if my environment is not fully supported?

- **Custom Overrides:** You can override internal feature detection by defining macros on the compiler command line. For example, `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` disables exception usage if your compiler does not support them.

- **Fallbacks:** GoogleTest offers fallbacks for some features, like using a simple regex engine when POSIX regex is unavailable.

- **Open an Issue or Patch:** If you encounter a platform-specific problem, consider reporting it to the GoogleTest maintainers or contributing a fix.

## 5. How to build GoogleTest and GoogleMock with my setup?

Steps to ensure correct build configuration:

<Steps>
<Step title="Using CMake">

- Clone the repository and create a build directory:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
  cd googletest
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```

- Generate build files: Plain GoogleTest with GoogleMock included by default

  ```bash
  cmake ..
  ```

- To build GoogleTest only, disable GoogleMock:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
  ```

- Build and install:

  ```bash
  make
  sudo make install
  ```

</Step>
<Step title="Set Compiler Flags">

Ensure your compiler flags include:

- **C++ Standard:** `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
- **Thread Support:** `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if using pthreads manually.
- **Shared Library Macros:** `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to build GoogleTest as a DLL, and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` for tests using the DLL.
</Step>
</Steps>

For comprehensive build and integration instructions, consult the [googletest/README.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md).

## 6. What common platform or compilation issues should I watch out for?

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform and Compiler Issues">
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows due to Runtime Mismatch">

If you see errors like `mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'`, ensure:

- You use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align runtime linkage.
- Your project and GoogleTest use the same CRT linkage (static or dynamic).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unsupported Platform Macros Not Defined">

If none of the `GTEST_OS_*` macros are set, GoogleTest won't enable platform-specific features and may not build correctly. Define or correct your platform environment or manually define the relevant macro.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Exception or RTTI Feature Detection Fails">

Some compilers or configurations might silently disable exceptions or RTTI. You can force-enable or disable them by defining `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` or `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` to `1` or `0` in your build flags.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Thread Safety Not Enabled on Multi-threaded Platforms">

GoogleTest auto-detects pthread support, but you may need to explicitly enable it with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` and link with pthreads (`-lpthread`) if GoogleTest’s detection fails.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
