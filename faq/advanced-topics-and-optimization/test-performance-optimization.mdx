# How Can I Speed Up My Test Runs?

Optimizing test execution time is crucial for efficient development workflows and continuous integration pipelines. This page provides actionable tips and best practices specifically geared towards speeding up your GoogleTest and GoogleMock test suites, helping you achieve faster feedback without sacrificing test quality.

## 1. Run Tests in Parallel

GoogleTest supports parallel test execution, allowing multiple tests or test cases to run simultaneously to fully utilize your CPU cores.

### Why Parallelize?
Running tests sequentially underutilizes modern multi-core processors. Parallel execution reduces the overall test runtime substantially, especially for large test suites.

### How to Enable
- Use the `--jobs` or `-j` flag in your test runner or your CI configuration to specify how many parallel jobs to spawn.
- Consider separate test binaries or split tests logically by component to maximize concurrency.

### Best Practices
- Ensure your tests are independent and do not share global state or mutable static data.
- Avoid relying on shared resources like files or databases unless properly isolated.
- Use thread-safe initialization and cleanup to prevent race conditions.

<Tip>
Parallel execution is a powerful tool but requires well-isolated tests. Use GoogleTest’s test fixtures carefully to encapsulate setup and teardown.
</Tip>

## 2. Minimize Setup and Teardown Overhead

Expensive setup and teardown in fixtures can severely slow down your tests.

### Strategies
- **Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for once-per-suite setup/teardown:** Move costly operations that do not need to run before every test case to the test suite level.
- **Lazy Initialization:** Initialize resources only when needed rather than upfront.
- **Reuse Shared Resources:** Cache and reuse heavy resources across tests when safe.

### Example
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Establish database connection once for all tests
    db_connection = ConnectToDatabase();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    DisconnectDatabase(db_connection);
  }

  static DatabaseConnection* db_connection;
};
```

## 3. Tune Your Test Suite for Large Codebases

When your project grows, test runs can become bottlenecks if tests aren’t organized for scalability.

### Recommendations
- **Split Tests into Multiple Binaries:** Dividing tests into smaller groups can reduce compilation time and enable parallel execution.
- **Use Test Filtering:** Run subsets of tests targeting changed code areas using GoogleTest’s `--gtest_filter` option.
- **Incremental Builds and Tests:** Integrate test runs with your build system to run only affected tests after code changes.

### Integration Tips
- Leverage popular build systems like CMake or Bazel which have built-in support for test splitting and parallel invocation.
- Use test sharding in your CI pipeline to distribute test runs over multiple machines.

---

## 4. Reference External Tools

### Parallel Test Runners
- **CTest with CMake:** Supports test parallelization and filtering.
- **Bazil Test Runner:** Provides native support for parallel testing and fine-grained dependency management.

### Code Coverage and Profiling
- Employ tools like **gcov**, **lcov**, or **llvm-cov** to identify slow or rarely executed tests.
- Prioritize optimizing or disabling slowest tests or ones with overlapping coverage.

### Test Caching
- Use caching mechanisms in CI to reuse test results when inputs have not changed, such as **Bazel’s** cache or **ccache** for compilation.

---

## 5. Summary of Best Practices

- Write isolated, independent tests to leverage parallel execution safely.
- Move heavy setup and teardown to suite-level where possible.
- Organize tests into logical groups and binaries to facilitate selective runs.
- Integrate test execution with your build system for incremental testing.
- Use tools and flags (`--gtest_filter`, `--gtest_repeat`, `--jobs`) to customize and optimize execution.

<Check>
Ensure your tests are designed for parallelism: no shared state and thread-safe.
</Check>

<Check>
Use suite-level setup to reduce repeated initialization costs.

<Check>
Break large test suites into smaller units and execute selectively by filters.

<Note>
Avoid blindly parallelizing if you have legacy tests dependent on shared state or resources without proper isolation.
