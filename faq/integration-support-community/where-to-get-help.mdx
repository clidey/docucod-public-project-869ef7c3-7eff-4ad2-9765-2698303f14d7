## Official Documentation

Whenever you need help with GoogleTest or GoogleMock, start by consulting the comprehensive and authoritative documentation available online:

- **GoogleTest Primer and Guides:** The conceptual foundations, getting started guides, and detailed walkthroughs for writing and running tests with `gtest` and `gmock`.
- **Mocking Reference:** Detailed API references describing mock class creation, method mocking (including `MOCK_METHOD` syntax), setting expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`), and controlling behavior with various clauses.
- **Assertions and Matchers API:** Comprehensive guides on how to write expressive assertions and effective matchers to validate test conditions.
- **Configuration and Runtime Flags Reference:** Learn about command-line flags like `--gmock_verbose`, and other runtime options affecting behavior and output.

You can find these and more in the [GoogleTest documentation navigation](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs) or through the structured docs available at:

- [Official GoogleTest GitHub](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [GoogleMock Mocking Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/mocking.md)
- [gMock Cookbook](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md)
- [gMock for Dummies](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md)


## Community and Discussion Forums

If your questions are not answered by the official docs, or you want to discuss use cases, patterns, or issues with other users and contributors, consider these community-driven resources:

- **GitHub Discussions:** Engage with GoogleTest developers and the user community in the GitHub Discussions section for asking questions, sharing experiences, and offering help. This is the most active and recommended place for collaboration.
- **Stack Overflow:** Use the [googletest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) and [google-mock](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-mock) tags for general questions and troubleshooting help. When posting, provide minimal reproducible examples and error output for quick and accurate responses.
- **GoogleTest Mailing Lists:** Some projects maintain mailing lists for announcements and support; check the project homepage.


## Issue Reporting and Feature Requests

For bugs, unexpected behaviors, or feature requests:

- **GitHub Issue Tracker:** Report verified bugs or request new features through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) in the official repository.
- **Before Reporting:** Thoroughly search existing issues to avoid duplicates. Check the documentation and recent releases to confirm the issue persists.
- **Bug Reports:** Provide clear reproduction steps, environment details (OS, compiler, versions), and test code snippets to enable maintainers to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently.


## Tips for Effective Support Requests

- Clearly describe the problem and your goal.
- Include exact error messages, minimal code samples, and relevant configuration or build commands.
- Specify your platform, compiler, and GoogleTest/GoogleMock versions.
- Mention any customizations, flags, or unusual build systems involved.

<Tip>
If you are new to GoogleTest or GoogleMock, start with the getting started guides and try simple tests to validate your setup before escalating to community forums or issue trackers.
