## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues and Suggesting Improvements

- **Identify Problems:** If you find bugs, inconsistencies, or have ideas for improvements, opening an issue on the project’s GitHub repository is the best way to get the maintainers’ attention.
- **Be Detailed:** Provide clear descriptions, steps to reproduce, environment details, and, if possible, a minimal example. This helps maintainers diagnose and address the problem rapidly.
- **Suggest Features:** For feature requests, outline the use case, benefit, and potential impact on the user experience.

### 2. Contributing Code Changes

- **Fork and Clone:** Begin by forking the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) and cloning it locally.
- **Development Workflow:** Implement your changes on a feature branch. Follow the existing coding style and guidelines to keep your changes consistent.
- **Testing Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your contributions using GoogleTest itself to maintain project quality.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** When ready, open a PR with a clear description of what your change does and why. Reference any issues your PR addresses.
- **Review and Iterate:** Engage with maintainers during the review process to refine your submission.

### 3. Improving Documentation

- Enhancing or correcting documentation is especially valuable.
- Submit PRs that improve clarity, add examples, fix errors, or update outdated content.
