# How Can I Contribute or Find Related Projects?

This page outlines how you can contribute to GoogleTest and GoogleMock, the collaborative C++ unit testing frameworks, and also introduces recommended third-party tools and extensions that enhance your testing workflow.

## Contributing to GoogleTest

GoogleTest and GoogleMock welcome contributions from the community. Whether you want to fix bugs, improve documentation, add new features, or enhance tests, your involvement is valuable.

### Getting Started with Contributions

1. **Read the Contributing Guidelines**

   Before submitting any changes, familiarize yourself with the project's standards by reading the official [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). This document covers:

   - How to set up your development environment.
   - Coding style and best practices specific to GoogleTest.
   - Process for submitting pull requests.
   - Guidelines on writing tests and documentation.

2. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   Start by forking the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) and then cloning your fork locally.

3. **Build and Test Your Changes**

   Use the provided CMake build system to compile the project and run all tests to ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**

   Follow the instructions in the contributing guide to submit your changes. A clear description of your changes and their purpose will help maintainers review your work efficiently.

### Best Practices for Contributions

- **Run all existing tests**: Verify your contribution doesn't introduce regressions.
- **Add new tests**: When adding features or fixing bugs, include tests to cover the changes.
- **Maintain clear commit messages**: Use descriptive and concise messages.
- **Engage in discussions**: Respond to review feedback promptly.

<Tip>
Contributing documentation improvements or tutorials is an excellent way to start if you are unfamiliar with the codebase.

## Recommended Third-Party Tools and Extensions

Several external tools and extensions can improve your testing productivity and reporting when working with GoogleTest.

### Helpful External Projects

- **GTest Runner**: A Qt5-based GUI test runner that allows easy test execution and visualization for Windows and Linux.
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner)

- **GoogleTest UI**: A C# test runner that tracks test progress visually with a progress bar and lists failures for easy navigation.
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar)

- **GTest TAP Listener**: An event listener implementing the [Test Anything Protocol (TAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol), useful if your test infrastructure supports TAP.
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener](https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener)

- **gtest-parallel**: Runs your test binaries in parallel to significantly speed up large test suites.
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel)

### IDE Extensions

- **GoogleTest Adapter (VS Code)**: Integrates GoogleTest with VS Code, enabling test discovery, running, and debugging directly from the editor.
  - Marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter)

- **C++ TestMate (VS Code)**: Supports GoogleTest along with other C++ test frameworks, providing UI integration for running and debugging tests.
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter)

### Test Code Generation

- **Cornichon**: A Gherkin DSL parser that generates GoogleTest stub code from feature files, bridging behavior-driven development with C++ tests.
  - PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/cornichon/](https://pypi.org/project/cornichon/)

<Tip>
Integrating these tools into your workflow can dramatically improve your testing efficiency, readability of results, and collaboration with your team.
