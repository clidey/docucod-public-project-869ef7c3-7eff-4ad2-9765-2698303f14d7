## 2. How to Report a Bug or Request a Feature

### Preparing Your Report

- **Provide Reproducible Steps:**
  - Include a clear description of the problem.
  - Share sample code snippets or tests that reproduce the issue.

- **Environment Details:**
  - Mention your compiler, OS, GoogleTest and gMock versions.
  - Note any special build or runtime flags used.

- **Error Messages and Logs:**
  - Attach detailed error messages, stack traces, or output logs.

- **Search Existing Issues:**
  - Confirm the issue has not been reported or fixed in a newer release.

### Filing the Issue

- Open a new issue in the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- Use descriptive titles.
- Tag issues appropriately (bug, feature request, question).

### Feature Requests

- Clearly state your use case and benefits.
- Suggest how the feature could be integrated or its potential API.

---

## 3. Contributing to GoogleTest and gMock

- Review the repository's **CONTRIBUTING.md** or equivalent guidelines.
- Follow coding, testing, and documentation standards.
- Write tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- Use the provided build and test environment for validation.
- Submit your changes via Pull Requests on GitHub.

---

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Help Requests

### Getting More Debug Information

- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces of mock calls.
- Adjust verbosity level (`error`, `warning`, `info`) to reduce or increase output noise.

### Handling Uninteresting or Unexpected Calls

- Use `NiceMock<>` to suppress warnings on uninteresting mock calls.
- Use `StrictMock<>` to treat uninteresting calls as errors.
- Add catch-all expectations if certain calls should be allowed but not actively tracked.

### Verifying Your Setup

- Run sample tests to confirm build and installation correctness.
- Check linking with both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries.
