# Organizing and Structuring Tests

This guide provides practical advice on structuring your test code for clarity and maintainability. It covers how to organize your tests, leverage test fixtures effectively, and use parameterized tests within GoogleTest and GoogleMock to achieve robust and scalable test coverage.

---

## 1. Designing Clear and Maintainable Test Code

When writing tests, your primary goal is to ensure your code is tested thoroughly without sacrificing readability or future maintainability. Well-organized tests help you quickly understand the intent, simplify debugging, and ease long-term upkeep.

### Why Organize Your Tests?

- **Readability:** New team members and your future self can quickly grasp what each test covers.
- **Reusability:** Common setup or utilities can be shared to reduce duplication.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in production code lead to fewer breaks and easier fixes.

### Structure Your Tests Like Your Code
Organize tests to mirror the structure of your main codebase:

- Group tests by feature or module.
- Within each group, separate tests for different classes or components.
- Name tests clearly to reflect what is being tested.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MathUtilsTest, ComputesFactorialOfZero) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(MathUtilsTest, ComputesFactorialOfPositive) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Here, all factorial-related tests belong to `MathUtilsTest`.

## 2. Using Test Fixtures to Share Setup and Teardown

Test fixtures are the cornerstone for organizing related tests by sharing common setup and cleanup routines.

### What is a Test Fixture?
A test fixture is a class derived from `::testing::Test` that:

- Sets up objects or state used by multiple tests.
- Handles any cleanup necessary after tests run.

### Benefits of Test Fixtures
- Avoid code duplication for common initialization.
- Provide a clean environment for each test, improving test reliability.

### How to Define and Use a Fixture
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
    db.InitializeSchema();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanInsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Insert("record"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanRetrieveRecord) {
  db.Insert("record");
  EXPECT_EQ("record", db.GetLatest());
}
```

Here, `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` prepare a consistent test environment for each test.

## 3. Leveraging Parameterized Tests for Robust Coverage

Parameterized tests let you run the same test logic with different inputs, reducing duplication and enhancing coverage.

### Why Parameterize?
- Test multiple input scenarios with a single test.
- Clearly separate test logic from test data.
- Catch edge cases more systematically.

### Using Value-Parameterized Tests
Use GoogleTest's `TEST_P` along with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to create tests with varying inputs.

Example:
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, DetectsEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

### Using Type-Parameterized Tests
Type-parameterized tests allow you to write tests that work with different types.

Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericLimitsTest : public ::testing::Test {};

typedef ::testing::Types<int, float, double> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericLimitsTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericLimitsTest, HasPositiveMin) {
  EXPECT_GT(std::numeric_limits<TypeParam>::min(), 0);
}
```

### Best Practices for Parameterized Tests
- Use descriptive test and parameter names.
- Limit the number of parameters per test to maintain clarity.
- Combine with test fixtures when setup is complex.

## 4. Organizing Mock Objects and Expectations

GoogleMock helps you create mock objects that simulate real dependencies. Properly structuring mocks and their expectations is key to understandable and maintainable tests.

### Define Mocks Clearly
- Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro inside `public` sections of your mock classes.
- Use qualifiers (`const`, `override`, etc.) consistently.

### Setting Expectations
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to define expected calls, arguments, and behaviors.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set behaviors without expectations.
- Prefer setting common default behavior with `ON_CALL` in fixtures to reduce noise.

### Managing Call Ordering
- Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to specify order constraints.
- Use `.After()` to express relative order dependencies.

### Avoid Over-Specification
- Use argument matchers (_wildcards_) to ignore unimportant parameters.
- Limit `EXPECT_CALL`s to actual behaviors you want to verify.

### Example:
```cpp
class MockLogger {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Log, (const std::string& message), (override));
};

TEST_F(MyTest, LogsError) {
  MockLogger mock_logger;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_logger, Log("Error occurred"));

  MyComponent comp(&mock_logger);
  comp.DoSomethingThatCausesError();
}
```

## 5. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Set Expectations Before Usage:** Always call `EXPECT_CALL` before running code that calls the mock methods.
- **Avoid Sticky Expectations Without Reason:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to prevent expectations from remaining active beyond their intended use.
- **Control Mock Strictness:** Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers to control how uninteresting calls are handled.
- **Use Parameterized Tests to Reduce Duplication:** Repeated test patterns indicate the opportunity for parameterized tests.
- **Balance Test Precision and Flexibility:** Too precise tests can be fragile; too loose can miss bugs.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Test Organization

### Common Issues
- **Tests too long or complex:** Break tests into smaller, focused cases.
- **Duplicate setup in multiple tests:** Refactor into test fixtures.
- **Excessive EXPECT_CALL warnings:** Use `ON_CALL` or wrap mocks with `NiceMock`.
- **Unexpected mock calls:** Ensure expectations cover all expected calls or explicitly forbid some calls with `.Times(0)`.

### Verification Tips
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to verify mocks before test teardown when necessary.
- Regularly clean up and delete mock objects to trigger automatic verification.

## 8. Summary
Organizing and structuring your tests using fixtures and parameterized tests significantly improves test clarity, reusability, and robustness. Leveraging GoogleMock's expectations and mock objects properly yields tests that accurately reflect and verify code behavior without becoming brittle or overly verbose.

<Tip>
Start simple: use fixtures to share setup, and add parameterized tests to cover varied input with minimal duplication. Use mocks wisely: set expectations where behavior matters and defaults otherwise.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid setting expectations after executing the code under test to prevent undefined behavior. Always verify mocks are properly destroyed or verified to catch expectation violations.
