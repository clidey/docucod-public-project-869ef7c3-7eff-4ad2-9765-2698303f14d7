# Working with Assertions and Matchers

GoogleTest provides a powerful and expressive system for verifying program behavior through assertions and matchers. This guide helps you understand how to use GoogleTest’s assertion macros and matchers to write clear, robust tests that validate the correctness of your code effectively.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions

Assertions are statements in your test code that verify whether conditions hold true. GoogleTest distinguishes between **fatal** and **non-fatal** assertions:

- **Fatal assertions** (`ASSERT_`) abort the current function immediately upon failure.
- **Non-fatal assertions** (`EXPECT_`) record the failure but allow the test to continue running.

This distinction lets you balance between strict enforcement and comprehensive failure reporting.

### Common Assertion Macros

- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` and `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` : Verify a boolean condition is true.
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` and `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` : Verify a boolean condition is false.
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` : Check equality using `==`.
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)` : Check inequality.
- Relational assertions like `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE`.
- String equality assertions `EXPECT_STREQ` and `EXPECT_STRNE` for C strings.
- Floating-point comparisons with `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, and `EXPECT_NEAR` that consider precision issues.
- Exception assertions such as `EXPECT_THROW` and `EXPECT_NO_THROW` for validating exception handling.

### Rich Assertion Messages

Assertions support streaming custom messages to provide additional context upon failure:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_ready) << "Initialization failed: state not ready";
```

This improves debug turnaround by making errors self-explanatory.

## 2. Leveraging Matchers

Matchers allow more expressive and flexible value comparisons beyond simple boolean checks. They are especially powerful when verifying mock function arguments but also usable with the `EXPECT_THAT` macros.

### Using Matchers in Assertions

- `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` and `ASSERT_THAT(value, matcher)`: Check whether `value` matches the criteria expressed by `matcher`.

### Common Matchers

- **Wildcard:** `_` matches any value.
- **Value-based:** `Eq(val)`, `Ne(val)`, `Lt(val)`, `Le(val)`, `Gt(val)`, `Ge(val)`.
- **Containers:** `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `Contains()`, useful for container argument matching.
- **Pointers:** `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`, and `Pointee(matcher)` for matching values pointed to.
- **Composite:** `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()` allow complex logical conditions.
- **Field and Property:** `Field(&Type::field_name, matcher)` matches objects with member fields that satisfy `matcher`. Similarly, `Property` matches member functions.

### Custom Matchers

GoogleTest makes it simple to write your own custom matchers for domain-specific validation using:

- `MATCHER` macros for quick matchers.
- Implementing matcher classes with `MatchAndExplain`, `DescribeTo`, and `DescribeNegationTo` for fine control and error messaging.

### Example: Using Matchers

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Return;

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(Gt(5)))
    .WillOnce(Return(true));

EXPECT_THAT(actual_value, AllOf(Gt(3), Lt(10)));
```

## 3. Writing Clear Mock Expectations

When using GoogleMock, you write expectations matching function calls on mocks using `EXPECT_CALL()`. Each expectation describes:

- **Which method** is expected to be called.
- **Expected argument matchers** specifying what arguments the call should have.
- **Call cardinality** via `.Times()`, specifying how many calls are expected.
- **Behavior** using `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()`, describing return values or actions.
- **Ordering constraints** with `.InSequence()`, `.After()`, and `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.

### Best Practices for Expectations

- Use `ON_CALL()` to set default behaviors without enforcing how many times a method is called.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL()` sparingly, only when you need to verify that a method call occurs.
- Avoid over-specifying argument matching; prefer more general matchers or omit unimportant arguments.
- Prefer sequences or `.After()` clauses to enforce the order where necessary.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations inactive once their invocation limits are reached.

### Example: Defining Expectations with Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(_, Ge(0)))  // expects second arg >= 0
    .Times(AtLeast(1))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));
```

## 4. Troubleshooting Assertions and Matchers

### Common Issues

- **Mismatch between expected and actual arguments:** Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed call matching logs.
- **Accidental over-specification of expectations:** Leads to brittle tests that break on minor changes. Relax argument matchers.
- **Uninteresting calls warnings:** Calls to mocked methods without associated `EXPECT_CALL()` show warnings unless using `NiceMock`.
- **Ambiguous mocked method overloads:** Use `Const()` or explicit matcher casts to resolve.
- **Missing actions or default values:** Functions with non-default-constructible return types require you to specify actions or default values explicitly.

### Debugging Strategy

- Enable verbose mode with `--gmock_verbose=info` to observe how calls match expectations.
- Check the ordering clauses; incorrect sequences or after clauses can cause unexpected failures.
- Verify that your matchers and expectations cover the necessary cases but avoid redundant constraints.

## 5. Practical Tips and Recommended Patterns

### Using `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`

`ON_CALL()` sets default behavior but does not require the call. Use it to define common fallback behaviors. Use `EXPECT_CALL()` only when the test must verify that the call is made.

### Managing Expectations Order

Use the `InSequence` helper or `.InSequence()` clause to impose an order on expectations.

Example:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2());
}
```

### Wide Argument Matching

If matching complex or multi-argument conditions, use the `.With()` clause which accepts a matcher on the tuple of all arguments.

### Retiring Expectations

If an expectation should become inactive after covering the expected call count, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid errors on extra calls.

### Avoid Expecting Too Many Tacit Calls

For mock methods that may be called unpredictably, use `NiceMock` or `.Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress unnecessary warnings.

`EXPECT_` assertions record failures but continue test execution, while `ASSERT_` assertions abort the current function immediately when they fail. Use `ASSERT_` when further execution depends on a condition.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="When should I use ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL for mock methods?">
