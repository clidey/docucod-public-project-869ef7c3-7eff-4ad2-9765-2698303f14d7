# Getting Support & Finding Help

When working with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, you will occasionally encounter issues or situations where additional help is needed to resolve problems or deepen your understanding. This page guides you through the official documentation, community resources, and support channels available for assistance.

## Official Documentation

The primary resource for understanding, using, and troubleshooting GoogleTest and GoogleMock is the comprehensive official documentation pages:

- **GoogleTest User’s Guide:** Covers all aspects of GoogleTest’s features, setup, and usage.
- **Mocking Reference:** A detailed look at GoogleMock's API for creating mocks and setting expectations.
- **gMock Cookbook:** Provides practical recipes and best practices for common mocking scenarios.
- **gMock for Dummies:** A beginner-friendly introduction to mocking concepts and usage.
- **gMock FAQ:** Answers frequently encountered questions specific to mocking behavior and issues.

You can access these documents online or within the project repository. Visiting these first can oftentimes provide immediate answers.

## Community Discussion Forums

Engage with other users and developers through community forums and mailing lists where you can ask questions, share insights, and learn from real-world experiences.

- **GitHub Issues:** The official repository's issue tracker is a good place to report bugs, request features, or discuss unexpected behavior.
- **Stack Overflow:** Tag your questions with `googletest` and `googlemock` to reach a broad audience of users.
- **Google Groups:** Some community mailing lists may be active with discussions on GoogleTest and GoogleMock topics.

Always check existing threads and issues before posting to avoid duplicates.

## Reporting Bugs

If you believe you have found a bug in GoogleTest or GoogleMock, follow these guidelines:

1. **Verify:** Try to reproduce the issue on the latest version to confirm it still exists.
2. **Isolate:** Create a minimal, self-contained example that reproduces the problem.
3. **Search:** Look for existing bug reports or discussions related to your issue.
4. **Report:** File a detailed bug on the official GitHub repository with your example and environment details.

Being thorough and clear helps maintainers diagnose and resolve the issue effectively.

## Accessing Help From Maintainers

While maintainers oversee the development of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, direct support might be limited due to community-driven development. However, they actively review:

- Bug reports
- Pull requests
- Critical security issues

You can contribute by:

- Submitting well-documented bug reports
- Creating reproducible test cases
- Offering patches or improvements

Maintainers encourage community involvement to improve and extend the project.
