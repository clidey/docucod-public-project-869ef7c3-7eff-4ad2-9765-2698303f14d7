# Resolving Common Error Messages

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide extensive diagnostics when tests fail, helping you quickly identify and fix issues. This guide addresses the most frequently encountered error messages, explains their causes from the user's perspective, and offers actionable solutions. Understanding these messages improves troubleshooting efficiency and enhances your test writing experience.

---

## 1. Assertion Failures

Assertion failures signal that the tested code did not behave as expected. GoogleTest distinguishes between **fatal** (`ASSERT_*`) and **nonfatal** (`EXPECT_*`) failures:

- **Fatal Failures** abort the current test function immediately.
- **Nonfatal Failures** allow the test to continue running.

### Common Assertion Failure Messages

#### Expected Equality

```none
Expected equality of these values:
  val1
    Which is: actual_value
  val2
    Which is: expected_value
```

- **Cause:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_EQ`, or similar assertions detected inequality.
- **Action:** Examine the printed actual and expected values. Validate your test setup or fix your code logic.

#### Boolean Condition Failed

```none
Value of: expression
  Actual: false
Expected: true
```

- **Cause:** `EXPECT_TRUE` or `ASSERT_TRUE` assertion failed.
- **Action:** Check the boolean condition, including side effects or inputs.

#### String Comparison Failed

For C strings:

```none
Expected: s1 == s2
  Actual: "string1"
           "string2"
```

- **Cause:** `EXPECT_STREQ` or `ASSERT_STREQ` found strings differ.
- **Action:** Verify string contents and encoding.

### Tips for Diagnosing Assertion Failures

- Use streaming messages with assertions to provide custom context:

  ```cpp
  EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Test failed with input " << input_data;
  ```

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add trace context within sub-functions:

  ```cpp
  void Helper(int x) {
    SCOPED_TRACE(testing::Message() << "Checking value=" << x);
    EXPECT_GT(x, 0);
  }
  ```

- Use predicate assertions (`EXPECT_PRED*`, `ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT*`) for complex conditions with clear failure messages.

## 2. Fatal Failure Macro Usage Errors

### Improper Use of `FAIL()` or `ASSERT_*`

- **Message:** Compilation or runtime errors when using `FAIL()` or `ASSERT_*` in non-void-returning functions.
- **Cause:** Fatal assertions abort the current function, which must be `void`. Using them in functions with return types causes compiler errors.
- **Solution:**
  - Use nonfatal assertions like `EXPECT_*` in non-void functions.
  - Refactor the function to return void.
  - If needed, rewrite the function to use out parameters rather than return values.

---

## 3. Test Fixture and Suite Errors

### Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the Same Test Suite

- **Message:**

  ```none
  All tests in the same test suite must use the same test fixture class.
  Mixing TEST and TEST_F in the same test suite is illegal.
  ```

- **Cause:** You defined tests with `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros sharing test suite names.
- **Solution:**
  - Use only `TEST` or only `TEST_F` for all tests in a given suite.
  - Rename test suites to separate tests requiring fixtures from those that don't.

### Duplicate Test Names

- **Message:** Test registration conflicts or failures when two tests share the same suite and test names.
- **Cause:** Defining two tests with identical full names (including suite and test names).
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure unique test names within a test suite.
  - Use namespaces or distinct test suites to separate similarly named tests.

---

## 4. Test Parameterization and Instantiation Warnings

### Uninstantiated Parameterized or Typed Tests

- **Message:**

  ```none
  Parameterized test suite XXX is defined via TEST_P but never instantiated.
  None of the test cases will run.
  ```

- **Cause:** Missing `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for a parameterized test suite.
- **Solution:**
  - Add `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` with appropriate parameter generators.
  - Alternatively, suppress warnings with `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(XXX);`.

---

## 5. Exception Assertion Failures

### EXPECT_THROW/ASSERT_THROW

- **Message:**

  ```none
  Expected: statement throws exception_type
  Actual: it throws a different type.
  ```

- **Cause:** Code under test throws an exception, but of a different type than expected.
- **Solution:**
  - Verify the exact exception type your code is expected to throw.
  - Adjust `EXPECT_THROW` or `ASSERT_THROW` accordingly.

- **Message:**

  ```none
  Expected: statement throws exception_type
  Actual: it throws nothing.
  ```

- **Cause:** Code under test did not throw any exception.
- **Solution:**
  - Verify that the statement indeed throws as expected.

### EXPECT_NO_THROW

- **Message:**

  ```none
  Expected: statement doesn't throw an exception.
  Actual: it throws.
  ```

- **Cause:** Code unexpectedly threw an exception.
- **Action:** Debug to understand what causes the exception.

---

## 6. Death Test Failures

### Common Death Test Errors

- **Message:** Death test failed because the statement did not cause process termination.
- **Cause:** The tested statement does not meet the required death condition.
- **Solution:**
  - Confirm the statement triggers process termination.
  - Verify the matching regex pattern in `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH`.
  - Check the death test style; sometimes switching between "fast" and "threadsafe" helps.

- **Warning:** Death tests require naming test suites ending with `DeathTest` to run first.

- **Note:** Death test code runs in a different process, meaning side effects are not visible.

### Best Practices

- Keep death tests in dedicated test suites.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to improve diagnosis within death tests.

---

## 7. Environment and Global Setup/TearDown Errors

- **Symptom:** Failures occurring during environment setup/tear down or in test suite setup.
- **Cause:** Failures or fatal assertions inside `Environment::SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, or test suite `SetUpTestSuite()`/`TearDownTestSuite()`.
- **Solution:**
  - Review setup and teardown code carefully.
  - Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests when preconditions are not met.
  - Ensure no assertions that abort tests are inside constructors or destructors (use `SetUp`/`TearDown` instead).

---

## 8. Property Recording Errors

- **Message:**

  ```none
  Reserved key used in RecordProperty(): key
  ('classname', 'name', 'status', 'time', 'type_param', 'value_param', 'file', and 'line' are reserved by GoogleTest)
  ```

- **Cause:** Attempting to record a test property using reserved XML attribute names.
- **Solution:**
  - Use custom keys not conflicting with reserved attribute names.
  - Avoid keys like `name`, `time`, `file`, etc.

---

## 9. Common Compilation and Linking Errors

- **Issue:** Missing GoogleTest headers or unresolved symbols.
- **Cause:** Incorrect include paths, missing linkage to GoogleTest libraries.
- **Solution:**
  - Verify include paths point to the correct `googletest/include` directory.
  - Link your tests with `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries appropriately.
  - For CMake users, use provided CMake targets for GoogleTest.

---

## 10. Unexpected Behavior with Assertion and Test Control Flow

### Assertion Propagation Pitfall

- **Issue:** Using `ASSERT_*` inside helper functions does not abort the calling test.
- **Explanation:** `ASSERT_*` aborts only the current function.
- **Solution:**
  - Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(helper_function());` to check for failures within helpers.
  - Alternatively, throw exceptions or check `HasFatalFailure()` after calling helpers.

### Using Fatal Assertions in Constructors or Destructors

- **Issue:** Fatal assertions in constructors or destructors do not abort tests as expected.
- **Explanation:** Can't use fatal assertions in constructors/destructors due to signature requirements.
- **Solution:**
  - Place fatal assertions in `SetUp()` or `TearDown()`.
  - For constructors, use `FAIL()` followed by program abort if appropriate.

---

## 11. Diagnosing Test Failures with SCOPED_TRACE

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual trace messages that appear in failure output.
- Helpful in loops or nested helper functions to identify which call failed.

```cpp
TEST(MyTest, Example) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    SCOPED_TRACE(testing::Message() << "Iteration " << i);
    EXPECT_TRUE(FuncUnderTest(i));
  }
}
```

---

## 12. Handling Flaky Tests

- Use `--gtest_repeat` flag to run flaky tests multiple times.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests conditionally.
- Enable `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop on first failure for quick diagnostics.

<Tip>
When an error message is unclear, enable verbose logging and debug flag options in GoogleTest to gain more insight.
</Tip>

<Info>
Remember, each `EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*` macro can be appended with a streaming message to add context, which is invaluable for diagnosing failures.
</Info>

<Warning>
Avoid placing fatal assertions in functions that return non-void types or in constructors/destructors; doing so leads to confusing compile-time errors or unintended partial execution.
</Warning>

<Callout>
If you encounter a failure during global environment setup or teardown, ensure that your `SetUp()` or `TearDown()` methods do not contain failing assertions unless intended, as these can cause cascaded failures.
</Callout>
