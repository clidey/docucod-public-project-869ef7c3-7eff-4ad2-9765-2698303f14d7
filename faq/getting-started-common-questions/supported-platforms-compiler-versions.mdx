# FAQ: What Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

---

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed for broad portability, ensuring you can write and run tests across a wide range of platforms and compiler environments. This FAQ page helps you verify that your development environment meets the necessary compatibility criteria, so you can integrate and upgrade these testing frameworks smoothly.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports most popular desktop and server operating systems, including:

- **Linux**: All major distributions.
- **Windows**: Desktop editions with support for MSVC, MinGW, and Cygwin.
- **macOS**: All recent versions supported by the latest Clang compiler.

Additionally, GoogleTest and GoogleMock also support a variety of other platforms for embedded and specialized development:

- Embedded systems like **ESP8266**, **ESP32**, and **NRF52** (with Arduino support).
- BSD variants such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.
- UNIX and UNIX-like systems including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX.

> GoogleTest detects your platform automatically and adjusts its behavior accordingly, but if your platform is unsupported, it may require additional customization or macro definitions.

---

## Supported Compilers and Minimum Versions

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17-capable compiler. Supported compilers include:

- **GCC**: Version 7.0 or higher.
- **Clang**: Version 5.0 or higher.
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: 2017 (version 15.0) or later.
- **Intel C++ Compiler** and other mainstream compilers that support C++17.

### Compiler Support Notes

- Older compiler versions may not fully support the required C++17 standard features, which will prevent successful compilation.
- MSVC must be version 2015 or newer to compile GoogleMock properly due to underlying required features.
- On Windows, Visual Studio projects linking against GoogleTest should consider `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to align runtime linkage.

---

## C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest mandates a **minimum of C++17** standard for compilation and usage. To ensure compatibility:

- Specify the C++ standard explicitly in your build system (e.g., in CMake use `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` and `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`).
- For projects integrating GoogleTest in C code, adding appropriate compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` is necessary.

Failure to meet the C++17 requirement will lead to compilation errors or unpredictable behavior.

---

## Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest detects and uses platform threading features to ensure thread-safe test execution:

- Utilizes **pthread** libraries when available for Unix-like systems.
- Uses Windows threading primitives on Windows environments.
- Threading detection and control occurs automatically, but can be overridden by manual macro definition, e.g., setting `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`.

In addition, synchronization primitives and thread-local storage are implemented to harmonize test runs in multi-threaded scenarios.

---

## Platform-Specific Policies

GoogleTest and GoogleMock include platform detection macros to handle compatibility:

- For Windows, special handling includes distinctions for desktop versus mobile editions, and specific compiler flags.
- For embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52, initialization and test execution is adapted for resource constraints and system integration.

These mechanisms ensure consistent test behavior regardless of platform by enabling/disabling features such as stream redirection, file system access, and exception handling.

## How To Verify Your Environment Compatibility

1. **Check your compiler version** to ensure it supports C++17 or higher.
2. **Confirm the operating system** is within the supported list or is compatible with POSIX/Windows threading.
3. **Ensure threading support (pthreads or Windows threads) is available** if running multi-threaded tests.
4. **Set necessary build flags** for shared libraries or static runtime linking as per your environment.
5. **Review `googletest/cmake/internal_utils.cmake`** in your build if using CMake to see how compiler flags are configured automatically.

<Tip>
By running `cmake ..` and building via CMake, your compiler and platform will be validated early with detailed diagnostics if unsupported configurations are detected.
</Tip>

## Common Installation and Upgrade Considerations

- Always use the **latest stable release** and consult system requirements documented in `/getting_started/requirements_installation/system_requirements`.
- When upgrading GoogleTest or GoogleMock, verify that your build environment still meets compiler and platform requirements, especially if your project environment updates compilers or OS versions.
- On Windows, use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to avoid runtime library conflicts during linking.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Issues">  
<Accordion title="Compiler Version Too Old">  
Ensure your compiler supports C++17. Upgrade GCC to 7+, Clang to 5+, or MSVC to 2017 or later.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Missing pthreads Support">  
On Linux/BSD platforms, missing pthreads can cause thread-related test failures. Confirm pthreads is installed and enabled, or manually define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatches on Windows">  
If you encounter linker errors related to runtime libraries, enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake, or align your project’s runtime with GoogleTest’s.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Embedded Platform Limitations">  
Embedded platforms like ESP32 have limited OS features. Use provided init and entrypoint APIs, and expect limited support for full GoogleTest features.
