# Test Performance & Scalability Tips

Maintaining fast, reliable, and scalable test suites is vital for efficient development, especially as your project and test volume grow. This guide addresses common questions and provides practical strategies for optimizing test performance and running tests in parallel effectively.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I reduce the overhead of large test suites?

- **Prioritize fast tests:** Organize tests so that the most critical or fastest tests run first, giving quicker feedback.
- **Avoid heavyweight setup:** Minimize expensive resource initialization in global or test fixture setups; prefer lightweight mocks or stubs instead.
- **Use test fixtures wisely:** Share common setup within fixtures to reduce redundancy but avoid holding expensive resources longer than necessary.
- **Limit resource usage:** For example, reduce usage of file I/O, network access, or heavy CPU operations in tests.
- **Employ test sharding:** Break the test suite into smaller, independent shards to run parts concurrently.

### What are effective strategies for parallel test execution?

- **Isolate tests:** Ensure tests do not depend on shared state or modify common resources to avoid flakiness.
- **Use build system features:** Leverage CMake or Bazel parallel test runners to execute multiple test binaries simultaneously.
- **Leverage test framework support:** GoogleTest supports running multiple tests in parallel as separate processes, which avoids contention.
- **Avoid global locks:** Tests that use global locks or singletons can block progress when running concurrently.
- **Run stress or load tests separately:** Isolate resource-heavy or flaky tests to dedicated jobs or times.

### How do I handle flaky tests affecting performance?

- **Detect and isolate:** Use test filtering and rerun strategies to identify flaky tests quickly.
- **Use retries sparingly:** Configure CI to retry failed tests a small number of times before declaring failure.
- **Fix root causes:** Address race conditions, shared state, or timing dependencies causing flakiness.
- **Mark unstable tests:** Temporarily disable or mark identified flaky tests to prevent affecting overall suite results.

### Are there tools or flags in GoogleTest/GoogleMock to help improve performance?

- **Test filters:** Use `--gtest_filter` to run subsets of tests that matter for your current changes.
- **Output controls:** Limiting verbose output with `--gtest_brief=1` can reduce test log clutter and speed up reporting.
- **Disable catch-leaked-mocks:** For very large mocks, disabling automatic memory leak detection can reduce overhead (use with caution).
- **Control test repetition:** Avoid unnecessary `--gtest_repeat` runs except during stress testing.

### How should I structure tests to support scalability?

- **Modularize tests:** Group related tests logically, keeping each test focused on one piece of functionality.
- **Use parameterized tests:** Reduce duplicated test code and enhance coverage efficiently.
- **Manage dependencies:** Minimize external dependencies and side effects to allow independent and parallel execution.

### How does GoogleMock work with multi-threaded tests?

- GoogleMock is thread-safe for mock *method calls*. You can use mocks concurrently across multiple threads safely.
- Set up expectations (`EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL`) *before* running multithreaded code. Setting up expectations concurrently can cause undefined behavior.
- Synchronize your test logic as needed; GoogleMock does not impose call ordering across threads.

## Best Practices

- **Write tests so they are independent and repeatable.** Avoid shared mutable state.
- **Prefer composition over inheritance** in tests to reduce complex fixture hierarchies and setup time.
- **Use mocks and stubs to isolate external dependencies**, accelerating test execution and reducing nondeterminism.
- **Cache heavy resources** where practical but ensure safe teardown.
- **Run slow tests in separate suites or jobs** to keep the main feedback loop fast.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Performance Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Test Suite Slow to Start">
Often caused by heavy global setup or static initializations. Try deferring setup to first use or per-test basis.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flaky or Intermittent Test Failures in Parallel Runs">
Check for shared state or insufficient synchronization. Use GoogleMock’s thread-safety guarantees properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Excess Memory Usage During Tests">
Look for unintended object retention, especially in mocks or test fixtures holding large data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Timeout on CI Systems">
Split tests into smaller units, increase timeouts, or isolate particularly long-running tests.

## Practical Tips for Running Tests Efficiently

<Steps>
<Step title="Run Tests in Parallel Where Possible">
Leverage your build tool and test runner’s parallel capabilities. Run multiple test binaries concurrently instead of serially.
</Step>
<Step title="Focus on Critical Tests">
Use `--gtest_filter` to execute only tests relevant to your recent changes for faster iteration.
</Step>
<Step title="Isolate Integration and System Tests from Unit Tests">
Integration tests often require more resources and should be run less frequently or in separate jobs.
</Step>
<Step title="Monitor Test Duration and Failures">
Periodically profile tests to identify and optimize slow or flaky tests.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Mock Objects to Minimize External Dependencies">
Mocks help keep tests quick and focused by simulating expensive or unpredictable resources.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Summary

Ensuring your test suite remains performant and scalable requires a combination of thoughtful test design, leveraging parallel execution capabilities, and isolating slow or flaky tests. GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide strong support for parallel test execution and thread-safe mocking, but effective use depends on careful test independence and resource management.
