# Support Channels and Further Help

This page consolidates the key avenues available for obtaining support and resolving issues related to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Beyond the information found in the FAQ, users will find paths to official documentation, community forums, issue trackers, and contribution guidelines. The goal is to provide clear, actionable directions on where and how to get help and contribute back.

## 1. Official Documentation

GoogleTest and GoogleMock come with a rich set of official documentation that covers all aspects of installation, usage, mocking, assertions, matchers, and advanced features. It is your first and most authoritative source for answers:

- **GoogleMock for Dummies** — A beginner-friendly guide that explains mock objects, their purpose, and how to use gMock effectively. It includes detailed examples and best practices.
- **Mocking Reference** — The complete API and macro reference for mock-related features including `MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`, and `ON_CALL`.
- **gMock Cookbook** — Recipes and patterns for commonly encountered mocking scenarios, advanced usage, and tips to overcome challenges.
- **gMock Cheat Sheet** — A compact quick-reference for defining mocks, setting expectations, and controlling behaviors.
- **Matchers Reference** — A full listing of argument matchers, how to write custom matchers, and combine matchers to express complex expectations.
- **Actions Reference** — Details on specifying behaviors and side effects for mocked methods through built-in and custom actions.
- **Cardinalities Reference** — Explanation of call frequency expectations and alternatives.
- **Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks** — Guidance on controlling warnings and strictness around unexpected or uninteresting calls.

These documents are regularly updated and accessible at the official GoogleTest GitHub repository site:

## 5. Practical Tips for Effective Support

- Always include your GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions when seeking help.
- Provide minimal reproducible examples to illustrate your problem.
- Read the documentation fully before opening new issues to avoid duplication.
- Enable verbose logging (e.g., `--gmock_verbose=info`) and share output when troubleshooting mock failures.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` judiciously to control the strictness of your mocks and detect unexpected interactions.

### Example: How to File an Effective Issue

```markdown
Title: Unexpected failure verifying EXPECT_CALL with lambda custom action

Description:
When writing an EXPECT_CALL with a lambda as an action on method `Foo()`, the test fails with an 'unexpected call' error although the method is called with expected arguments.

Setup:
- GoogleTest version: main branch as of 2024-06
- Compiler: GCC 12
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04

Steps to reproduce:
1. Define a mock class with MOCK_METHOD for `Foo()`.
2. Create a test with EXPECT_CALL that uses a lambda in WillOnce().
3. Run the test.

Expected behavior:
The test should pass as the arguments match the expectation.

Actual behavior:
Test fails with:

```
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
Function call: Foo(42)
Expected: to be called once
  Actual: never called
```

Additional info:
- The lambda action does not capture by reference or raw pointers.
- Reducing to a simple Return() action works fine.

Can provide minimal repro if needed.
```

This level of detail helps maintainers diagnose and address your issue quickly.
