# How Do I Troubleshoot Common Test Failures and Linking Problems?

GoogleTest is a comprehensive testing framework, but sometimes you may encounter errors during build, link, or runtime that prevent your tests from running correctly. This guide focuses on diagnosing and resolving *common test failures and linking problems* specifically related to executing GoogleTest-based test suites.

Whether you are facing linker errors, segmentation faults, symbol lookup failures, or unexpected runtime crashes during test execution, this page provides clear, actionable troubleshooting flows and best practices to help you get your tests running reliably.

## 1. Frequent Build and Linking Errors

### Q: Why do I get linker errors like "undefined reference to gtest_main" or "multiple definitions"?

**Cause & Solution:**

- **Missing GoogleTest main:**
  - If you use GoogleTest library (`gtest`) but do not link to `gtest_main` or provide your own `main()`, the linker will complain that `main` is undefined.
  - **Fix:** Link against `gtest_main` target or define your own `main()` that calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- **Multiple definition errors:**
  - Can occur if `gtest` sources are included multiple times or conflicting static/shared libraries are linked.
  - **Fix:** Ensure GoogleTest is linked only once, avoid mixing static and shared libraries, and avoid including source files in multiple targets.

- **Incorrect linkage order:**
  - Some linkers require GoogleTest libraries appear after your test object files.
  - **Fix:** Place `-lgtest` after your test objects in linker command.

### Q: How do I properly link GoogleMock and GoogleTest together?

**Answer:** GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest. Link `gmock` and `gtest` in proper order, typically `-lgmock -lgtest -pthread`. Build their static or shared libraries according to your build system (see the [Integration Build Systems FAQ](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/faq/usage-integration-faq/integration-buildsystems.md) for details).


## 2. Runtime Failures and Test Crashes

### Q: My test crashes with a segmentation fault during execution. What should I check?

**Step-by-step guide:**

- **Check test fixture and mocks:**
  - Verify test fixtures initialize members properly before use.
  - Check that mock objects are set up correctly with valid expectations and actions.

- **Validate dependencies:**
  - Ensure any external dependencies your code needs during tests are available (files, environment variables, network, etc).

- **Use Address Sanitizer or Valgrind:**
  - Run your tests under memory error detectors to catch invalid accesses or leaks.

- **Isolate failing tests:**
  - Run the failing test individually (use `--gtest_filter=TestSuite.TestName`) to minimize noise and isolate cause.


### Q: Why does my test fail with symbol lookup errors (`undefined symbol`) or similar?

**Cause & Fix:**

- This indicates runtime linker failures:
  - Your test executable may be missing linkage against some shared libraries.
  - Binary incompatibilities (ABI mismatches) can also cause this.

- **Resolution:**
  - Confirm that all required dynamic libraries are accessible in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or system path.
  - Match compiler versions and flags across your test and all linked components.


## 3. Handling Death Tests and Unexpected Behavior

### Q: My death test fails unexpectedly or crashes. How do I troubleshoot death tests?

Death tests monitor code that should terminate abnormally (e.g., assertions triggering abort). They run the test code in a subprocess and verify exit codes and stderr output.

**Key Tips:**

- Use the recommended test naming pattern: test suites with `*DeathTest` suffix to ensure they run first and isolated.

- Understand death test styles ("fast" vs "threadsafe"):
  - "fast" runs the death statement immediately after fork.
  - "threadsafe" fully re-executes the test binary with flags to isolate the death test.

- Confirm the death test statement *actually* causes termination.

- Check your death test matcher regex syntax against GoogleTest supported subset.

- Avoid complex setup in death tests that involves multiple threads or forks.

- If death tests leak memory (commonly mocks), consider allowing leaks with `Mock::AllowLeak`.

- Use `ASSERT_DEATH` and `EXPECT_DEATH` macros with careâ€”avoid assertions or returns inside the death test statement that can cause divergence.


### Example of a Death Test:

```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, AbortsOnInvalidInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({ MyFunction(nullptr); }, "null pointer passed");
}
```


## 4. Symbolic Debugging Tips

- Use `gdb` or your debugger to run tests step-by-step.
- Use GoogleTest flags:
  - `--gtest_break_on_failure` to break on assertion failure for debugging.
  - `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests.

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Multiple `main()` symbols:** Avoid including GoogleTest source files in your project as normal code.
- **Mixing static/shared libs:** Stick to either static or shared builds consistently.
- **Using death test macros improperly:** Avoid returns or throwing exceptions inside death test statements.
- **Threading issues in death tests:** Death tests expect single-threaded environments.


## 6. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Checklist

<Steps>
<Step title="Build and Link">
Ensure correct linking against `gtest` and `gtest_main` libraries, verify linker input order, and confirm no symbol conflicts.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Isolated Tests">
Use `--gtest_filter` to run failing or crashing tests individually.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Debugging Tools">
Run failing tests under `gdb`, AddressSanitizer, or Valgrind to identify memory or logic errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Death Test Usage">
Verify death test macros are used correctly, with proper regex matcher syntax and naming conventions.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate Environment">
Confirm runtime dependencies like environment variables or auxiliary files exist and are accessible.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 7. Additional Diagnostics and Reporting

- Enable verbose GoogleTest output flags for detailed test logs.
- Generate XML or JSON test reports using `--gtest_output=xml:<file>` or `--gtest_output=json:<file>`.


## 8. Where to Get Further Help

- Consult the [Integration Build Systems FAQ](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/faq/usage-integration-faq/integration-buildsystems.md) for linking and build questions.
- Review the [Death Tests API Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/api-reference/core-testing-api/death-tests.md) for in-depth death test info.
- Check platform-specific building and runtime considerations at [Supported Platforms FAQ](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/faq/getting-started-faq/supported-platforms.md).
- Visit [GoogleTest GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) for community reported problems.

## Appendix: Common Error Examples

### Example Linker Error
```
undefined reference to `main`
```
**Fix:** Link `gtest_main` or define `main()`.

### Example Runtime Segfault
- Occurs in test `FooTest.Bar`
- Typically due to uninitialized pointers or invalid memory access

**Fix:** Check the test code and all fixture setup/teardown.

### Death Test Failure Message
```
FAILED TEST: The process did not die as expected.
Expected stderr matching: "invalid argument"
```

Verify the death statement causes termination and regex matches stderr.
