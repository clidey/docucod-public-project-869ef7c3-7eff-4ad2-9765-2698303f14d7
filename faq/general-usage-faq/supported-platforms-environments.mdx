# Supported Platforms and Environments

Understanding the platforms and environments where GoogleTest can be effectively used is essential for a smooth setup and reliable testing experience. This page clarifies which operating systems, compilers, and build tools are supported, how you can troubleshoot platform-specific issues, and where to find up-to-date compatibility information.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide array of operating systems with stable support primarily on the most common platforms. These are automatically detected during compilation through predefined macros. Key supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (including Android variants)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, Windows RT)
- **Mac OS X and iOS**
- **Other UNIX-like platforms:** FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, DragonFlyBSD, GNU/Hurd, QNX, Haiku, and others

<Info>
If your target platform is less common or embedded (e.g., ESP8266, Xtensa), GoogleTest tries to detect support but these may have limited functionality or require manual tweaks.
</Info>

### How GoogleTest Detects Platforms

During compilation, platform-specific macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`) are defined automatically, enabling GoogleTest to adapt its implementation accordingly. However, in rare cases, you may need to define or override these macros manually in your build environment.

---

## 2. Compiler and Build Tool Requirements

### C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires an environment supporting **C++17** or newer. During compilation, a check enforces this minimum standard:

```cpp
#if !defined(GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG) || GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG < 201703L
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
#endif
```

Ensure your compiler flags a minimum of `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

### Supported Compilers

GoogleTest has been tested and supports major compilers including:

- GCC (generally 7.0 and above for best compatibility)
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC 2017 Update 3 or later)
- Intel LLVM
- Sun Pro, IBM Visual Age, HP aCC, and others

Compiler-specific flags can be configured, for example, to enable exception handling, RTTI, or disable strict warnings. GoogleTest's CMake build scripts come with built-in optimizations for different compilers.

### Build Tools

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with common build tools such as:

- **CMake**: The recommended cross-platform build system. GoogleTest includes CMake scripts and instructions for standalone or integrated builds.
- **Make**: Supported on Unix-like systems when building standalone via CMake-generated Makefiles.
- **Visual Studio**: Generates `.sln` and `.vcproj` files for Windows development.

<Note>
You must ensure that your build setup links against threading libraries (e.g., pthreads on Linux/macOS) if your platform supports multi-threading.
</Note>

---

## 3. Threading and Multi-threaded Tests

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with `pthreads` or Windows native threading, controlled via the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.

- On Unix-like systems with `pthread.h`, threading support is automatically enabled.
- On Windows desktop and MinGW, native threading primitives are used.

If GoogleTest fails to detect pthread support in your environment, you can force it by adding compiler flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1   # Enable pthread explicitly
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0   # Disable pthread explicitly, thread-unsafe mode
```

Ensure linker settings include pthreads (`-pthread`) if using pthreads.

---

## 4. Key Platform and Feature-related Macros

GoogleTest uses the following macros to reflect platform capabilities. These are automatically set or overridden at build time.

| Macro Name                       | Description                                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`           | Whether C++ exceptions are enabled               |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`                 | Whether RTTI is enabled                           |
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`              | Availability of `<pthread.h>` and threading     |
| `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`             | POSIX extended regex support                      |
| `GTEST_HAS_CLONE`                | Availability of `clone(2)` system call           |
| `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`          | Support for `std::wstring`                        |
| `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`          | Whether a file system is accessible               |
| `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`  | Capability to redirect stdout/stderr for capture |
| `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`           | Support for death tests (requires FS)             |

These macros influence features such as death tests, file handling, regular expression support, and exception safety. For example, death tests require file system access and may not run on constrained environments.

## 5. Troubleshooting Platform-Specific Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Platform-Specific Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Missing pthreads">
If your build fails linking pthreads on Linux or Unix, ensure your build commands include `-pthread` both at compile and link time. If using CMake, this is handled automatically when pthreads are detected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unicode and Wide String Issues on Windows">
The presence or absence of `std::wstring` support might cause issues on older Windows or Cygwin platforms. GoogleTest uses `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING` internally to detect this. If you encounter errors related to wide strings, check your compiler and platform support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Not Detecting C++17 Standard">
Check that your compiler's C++ standard version flag is set appropriately. For GCC and Clang, add `-std=c++17`. For MSVC, ensure using Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Running GoogleTest on Embedded or Constrained Systems">
Certain embedded platforms (for example, ESP8266, Xtensa) might not fully support GoogleTest features due to lack of file system, threading, or exceptions. You may need to customize GoogleTest or disable certain features.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Proactive Tips

- Regularly consult the [Supported Platforms](docs/platforms.md) resource for canonical compatibility info.
- Use the `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro to control threading explicitly.
- Use GoogleTest's CMake integration, which automates many platform-specific configurations.
- For shared library builds on Windows, ensure appropriate definitions: `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building the library, and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when linking your tests.

##### Example: Checking Platform Macro in Your Test Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

#if GTEST_OS_LINUX
  std::cout << "Running on Linux" << std::endl;
#elif GTEST_OS_WINDOWS
  std::cout << "Running on Windows" << std::endl;
#elif GTEST_OS_MAC
  std::cout << "Running on Mac" << std::endl;
#else
  std::cout << "Running on an unsupported or unknown platform" << std::endl;
#endif

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This can confirm platforms detected by GoogleTest during compilation.

## Troubleshooting Quick Tips

- **Stream Redirection Not Working:** Happens on platforms lacking `dup()`/`dup2()`. Feature disabled automatically on embedded/mobile.
- **Death Tests Fail:** Are disabled when file system is not available or on unsupported platforms.
- **Incompatible Compiler Features:** Verify exception and RTTI settings; override with macros if needed.
