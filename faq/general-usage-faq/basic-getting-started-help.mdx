# Getting Started & Common Beginner Questions

Welcome to the essential FAQ designed specifically for new users starting their journey with GoogleTest. Here, you’ll find clear answers to fundamental questions about writing your first test, navigating core documentation, and discovering the best learning resources to get up and running quickly and effectively.

## 1. How do I write my first test?

Writing your first test in GoogleTest is straightforward and highly intuitive. Follow these steps to create a simple unit test:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up Your Test Function">
Use the `TEST` macro to define your test. It takes two parameters: the test suite name and the test name.

```cpp
TEST(MyFirstTestSuite, TestWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}
```

This defines a test named `TestWorks` in the suite `MyFirstTestSuite` that checks if `1 + 1` equals `2`.
</Step>
<Step title="Compile and Link with GoogleTest">
Make sure your code is compiled and linked with the GoogleTest library (usually `gtest` or `gtest_main` for convenience).

If you link with `gtest_main`, GoogleTest provides a default `main()` function, so you don't need to write one.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Your Tests">
Run the resulting executable. GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs all tests defined with `TEST()`.

The test runner will report success or failure for each test.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Minimal Test Program

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and run the above program to see your first test in action.

<Info>
Tip: To skip writing your own `main()` function, link your test executable with the `gtest_main` library instead of `gtest`.

## 2. Where can I find the core documentation for GoogleTest?

GoogleTest’s comprehensive documentation is thoughtfully organized into several key resources that guide you through the framework’s capabilities:

- **[GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html)** — Your foundational guide covering basic test writing, assertions, and setup.
- **[Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md)** — Detailed information on all assertion macros available.
- **[Testing Reference](reference/testing.md)** — Covers all test writing facilities including fixtures, parameterized tests, and test registration.
- **[Getting Started Guides](guides/getting-started/setup-and-first-test.md)** — Step-by-step instructions from setup through writing and running tests.

These guides provide both the conceptual background and practical examples to empower you with both beginner and advanced knowledge.

## 3. What are the best starting points for new users?

To make your learning curve much smoother, begin with the following progressive workflow:

1. **Read the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html)** to understand the framework’s purpose and structure.
2. **Follow the [Setup and First Test Guide](guides/getting-started/setup-and-first-test.md)** for environment setup and writing your first real tests.
3. **Explore the [Core Assertions & Best Practices](guides/getting-started/core-assertions-best-practices.md)** guide to master assertion usage and how to write clear tests.
4. **Learn to Run and Organize Tests** via the [Running, Organizing, and Interpreting Tests](guides/getting-started/running-and-organizing-tests.md) guide.

Each step builds upon the last, giving you the confidence and skills needed for efficient testing.

<Note>
If you encounter any setup issues or common beginner pitfalls, consult the [FAQ & Common Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting-help/faq-common-issues.md) documentation for quick fixes.
</Note>

## 4. How do I invoke and control running tests?

GoogleTest automatically registers your tests written with `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros. To execute all tests:

- Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` in your `main()` function to initialize.
- Call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to run every test and return an exit code indicating success or failure.

Example `main()`:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Useful command-line flags

- `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` — Run a subset of tests matching the pattern.
- `--gtest_list_tests` — List all test names without running.
- `--gtest_break_on_failure` — Drop into debugger on failure.
- `--gtest_repeat=N` — Repeat test runs N times for flaky tests.

Run your test binary with the `--help` flag to see the full list of supported options.

## 5. How can I get help if I’m stuck or encounter problems?

If you face hurdles during setup or test writing, the following resources will assist you:

- **[FAQ & Common Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting-help/faq-common-issues.md)** — Answers to frequent beginner problems.
- **[Installation & Setup FAQ](faq/general-usage-faq/installation-setup.md)** — Solve build and installation issues.
- **[Supported Platforms & Languages](faq/general-usage-faq/supported-platforms-languages.md)** — Ensure your environment meets requirements.
- **Community Forums and Issue Trackers** — Engage with other users and contributors for help.

You’re encouraged to first consult the FAQ documentation; it covers the majority of common questions and error scenarios.

## Quick Tips for Beginners

- Always name test suites and tests without underscores to follow GoogleTest conventions.
- Leverage `TEST_F` for tests needing shared setup or teardown.
- Use `EXPECT_` assertions when multiple checks per test are desired; use `ASSERT_` when failure must stop the test early.
- Take advantage of GoogleTest’s rich command-line options to filter and debug tests efficiently.
- Gradually explore advanced testing patterns like parameterized tests once comfortable with basics.
