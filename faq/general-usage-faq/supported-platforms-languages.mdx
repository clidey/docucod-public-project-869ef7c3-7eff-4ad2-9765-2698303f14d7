# Supported Platforms & Language Versions

This page provides essential information about the compilers, operating systems, and C++ language versions that GoogleTest officially supports. It helps you select compatible development environments to ensure seamless integration and best performance when using GoogleTest.

---

## Officially Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a broad range of platforms aligned with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This ensures reliability and consistency across supported environments.

Key supported platforms include:

- **Windows (Desktop and MinGW variants)**
- **Linux distributions**
- **macOS**
- Other Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris

For an up-to-date compatibility matrix listing supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build tools, refer to the table documented in the [Foundational C++ Support repository](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Platform Detection

GoogleTest internally detects the current platform during compilation via macros defined in its portability layer (e.g., `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`) to adapt its implementation accordingly, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.


## Supported Compilers and Toolchains

GoogleTest requires modern C++17 compilers to build and operate correctly. It supports a variety of compiler toolchains, including but not limited to:

- **GCC 7.0+**
- **Clang 5.0+**
- **MSVC 2017 Update 3 (v19.11) or newer**
- **Apple Clang shipped with modern Xcode versions supporting C++17**

Ensure your compiler meets or exceeds these version requirements for full compatibility.


## C++ Language Version Requirements

GoogleTest mandates **C++17** compliance. This is a strict requirement; compilers not supporting C++17 or newer standard features will not compile the framework successfully. This ensures GoogleTest can leverage modern language features for performance, safety, and maintainability.


## How to Verify Your Environment

Confirm your platform and compiler compatibility by:

1. Checking your platform against the [Foundational C++ Support Policy matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).
2. Validating your compiler version follows the minimum required version (e.g., `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or Visual Studio version).
3. Confirming your compiler invocation uses the C++17 standard flag (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).


## Additional Notes

- GoogleTest supports various other platforms with varying degrees of stability, but these are not officially guaranteed.
- Compile-time platform detection enables GoogleTest to behave appropriately according to each supported environment.
- For embedded or specialized platforms, confirm if your environment has the necessary filesystem and threading support, as GoogleTest depends on these features for several functionalities (e.g., death tests).

## Helpful Tips

- Always target supported compiler versions to avoid build and runtime issues.
- Use the provided CMake and Bazel integration guides for seamless build environment setup.
- If working in an unsupported or experimental environment, be prepared for custom maintenance and debugging.
