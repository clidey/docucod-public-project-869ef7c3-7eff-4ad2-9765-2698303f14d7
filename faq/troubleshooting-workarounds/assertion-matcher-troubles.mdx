# Assertions, Matchers & Test Failures FAQ

This page addresses the common reasons behind unexpected assertion failures and matcher behaviors in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It guides users on diagnosing issues, understanding matcher semantics, and applying best practices for writing clear, maintainable, and robust assertions.

---

## 1. Why is my test failing due to an unexpected assertion?

When a test fails unexpectedly due to assertions, it's often because the expected and actual values do not match according to the assertion's criteria. Common causes include:

- Overly strict argument matchers that don't allow flexibility.
- Misspecified expectations or cardinalities on mock methods.
- Default mock behaviors interfering due to missing `EXPECT_CALL`s.

### How to debug:
- Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed traces of mock calls, matched expectations, and reasons why expectations fail.
- Check the exact values printed in the failure messages—GoogleTest prints both expected and actual values.
- Verify that your mock method's `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` is properly set up with the right matchers and actions.

---

## 2. What is the difference between `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` and how does it affect failures?

- `EXPECT_CALL` not only sets what the mock method should do but also sets an expectation that the method **must** be called with matching arguments (and how many times).
- `ON_CALL` only specifies what the method should do **by default** but does not require the method to be called.

**Implications:**
- If a method is called without a matching `EXPECT_CALL`, GoogleMock considers it an *uninteresting* call, which generates a warning. If you want to suppress this warning, use `NiceMock` or add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `.Times(AnyNumber())`.
- If a method is called with arguments not matching any `EXPECT_CALL`, it is an *unexpected* call and results in a test failure.

---

## 3. Why do I get warnings about “Uninteresting mock function call” even though I set default behavior with `ON_CALL`?

GoogleMock prints warnings on uninteresting calls by default because it encourages explicit specification of expectations where calls matter.

### What you can do:
- Use `NiceMock<T>` instead of `T` to suppress uninteresting call warnings.
- Add an `EXPECT_CALL(mock.method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly state that calls are allowed without warning.
- Increase or decrease verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error`.

---

## 4. How do Matchers work and what should I watch out for?

Matchers provide a powerful way to specify conditions on function arguments. Key points:

- **Basic use:** Exact value matching by default; e.g., `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5))` matches calls with argument 5.
- **Wildcards:** Use `_` to accept any argument.
- **Composite and custom matchers:** Use `AllOf`, `AnyOf`, `Not`, or create your own matchers for complex conditions.
- **Type safety:** Matchers are statically typed; use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` when type conversions are necessary.

### Common pitfalls:
- Using overly restrictive matchers that don't match actual arguments.
- Matching argument types incorrectly causing compilation errors.
- Using stateful or side-effecting matchers, which are disallowed.

---

## 5. How to interpret “Too many” or “Too few actions specified” warnings in `EXPECT_CALL`?

Each `EXPECT_CALL` can specify actions with `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()`. These actions define the behavior when a matching call occurs.

- "Too many actions" warning means you have more `WillOnce()` clauses than allowed by the call count specified by `Times()` or inferred cardinality.
- "Too few actions" warning means you have fewer `WillOnce()` clauses than the minimum required and no `WillRepeatedly()` clause to cover the rest.

**Fixes:**
- Ensure the number of `WillOnce()` calls aligns with the expected call count.
- Use `WillRepeatedly()` to define behavior for subsequent calls after all `WillOnce()` actions are exhausted.
- Adjust or explicitly set `Times()` to match your intentions.

---

## 6. Why does the order of `EXPECT_CALL` statements matter?

GoogleMock processes expectations in **reverse order** (the last matching expectation overrides earlier ones). This design allows:

- Setting generic expectations first (e.g., catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(_)).Times(AnyNumber())`), then
- Overriding for more specific argument matches later.

If the order is reversed, specific expectations get shadowed by general ones.

### To avoid confusion:
- Place the more generic `EXPECT_CALL`s before the more specific ones.
- Consider using sequences or composing multiple actions instead of relying on order.

---

## 7. What does it mean when a call is "sticky" and how to properly sequence expectations?

Expectations in GoogleMock are *sticky* by default, meaning they remain active even when saturated. This can lead to unexpected failures if multiple expectations overlap.

### How to handle:
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations that should become inactive after matching the specified calls.
- Use `InSequence` blocks to impose an order and automatic retirement of expectations.

Example:
```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(1)).WillOnce(...).RetiresOnSaturation();
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(2)).WillOnce(...).RetiresOnSaturation();
}
```

---

## 8. Why does `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method())` without arguments sometimes fail to compile?

This shorthand syntax works only for **non-overloaded** methods. If the method is overloaded, the compiler cannot disambiguate which overload you mean.

### How to fix:
- Specify argument types and count exactly in the `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Use helper matchers like `An<T>()` or `Matcher<T>` to specify argument matchers explicitly.
- Provide a simplified mock interface with uniquely named methods for testing if the overloaded methods are cumbersome.

---

## 9. Why do unexpected calls return default values instead of causing immediate test failures?

When an *unexpected* call (one that doesn't match any `EXPECT_CALL`) occurs, GoogleMock:

- Runs the default action, if any (from `ON_CALL`), or returns the default value for the return type.
- Issues a failure but allows the test to continue, so you get a report with as many errors as possible.

This helps avoid early termination of complex tests and gives detailed insight on unmatched calls.

---

## 10. What should I do when I receive "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings frequently?

This indicates that your mock object is called on methods without expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`), leading to uninteresting calls.

### Remediation:
- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress these warnings when calls are legitimate but not of test interest.
- Add explicit `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to silence warnings for particular methods.
- Reconsider if the test should have `EXPECT_CALL`s for those calls to verify behavior.

---

## Additional Best Practices and Tips

- **Avoid overspecification:** Only specify what matters in your matchers and expectations to keep tests maintainable.
- **Use sequences for order-sensitive expectations:** `InSequence` is your friend when call order matters.
- **Leverage `--gmock_verbose=info` for debugging:** Provides clear tracing of mock calls and expectation matching.
- **Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky expectation pitfalls:** Makes your intentions explicit.
- **Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with matchers for expressive assertions:** It produces readable failure messages that help diagnose issues.
- **Recognize uninteresting vs unexpected calls:** The former is calls without expectations, the latter are calls violating an expectation.

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

### Compilation Errors on Mock Methods
- Wrap argument types containing commas in parentheses or use type aliases.
- Ensure virtual destructors exist for interfaces being mocked.

### Test Failures Due to Unsatisfied Expectations
- Verify that all expected calls are exercised.
- Run with detailed verbosity to locate missing or mismatched expectations.

### Runtime Warnings About Uninteresting Calls
- Add appropriate expectations or switch to `NiceMock` to suppress warnings.
