# Best Practices for Mocking in Complex Test Scenarios

This guide provides expert recommendations for creating maintainable and effective mocks when dealing with intricate or legacy codebases in GoogleMock. It emphasizes judicious selection of mock strictness levels and thoughtful use of combinations between actions and argument matchers to craft robust, readable, and reliable tests.

## Understanding Mock Strictness Levels

In complex testing scenarios, controlling uninteresting calls—those calls to mock methods without explicit expectations—is critical. Choosing the right level of strictness shapes your test’s feedback and maintainability.

### StrictMock
- Treats *all* uninteresting calls as test failures.
- Use when it is vital that *all* invocations on mocks are explicitly specified, ensuring no unexpected interactions slip by unnoticed.
- Ideal for legacy codebases where precise contract protection is mandatory.

### NaggyMock (Default Behavior)
- Prints warnings on uninteresting calls but does not fail the test.
- Helps you detect possibly missing expectations while not blocking test progress.
- Useful during development or debugging when tests or code may evolve rapidly.

### NiceMock
- Suppresses warnings about uninteresting calls, effectively ignoring unexpected ones.
- Recommended for making tests less brittle in large or legacy codebases where irrelevant calls shouldn't cause failures.
- Encouraged for production-quality tests aiming for long-term maintainability.

**Tip:** Prefer `NiceMock` for most cases to avoid brittle tests, use `NaggyMock` while debugging, and apply `StrictMock` sparingly for pinpoint testing.

## Selecting the Appropriate Strictness Level

Consider this user flow when choosing mock strictness:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with NiceMock">
Begin by wrapping mocks with `NiceMock` to minimize spurious warnings and failures.
</Step>
<Step title="Add EXPECT_CALLs for Important Interactions">
Specify explicit expectations only for interactions relevant to your test intent.
</Step>
<Step title="Use NaggyMock if Uninteresting Calls Need Attention">
Switch to `NaggyMock` if you want visibility of unexpected calls but don’t want tests to fail immediately.
</Step>
<Step title="Apply StrictMock to Enforce Exact Interactions">
Reserve `StrictMock` for scenarios where any extraneous calls must cause a test failure.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Combining Action and Matcher Clauses Effectively

In complex testing, crafting expectations with precise matchers and corresponding actions ensures clarity and robustness.

### Matchers — Specify Only What Matters

- Use `_` (wildcard matcher) for arguments where the value is irrelevant.
- Avoid over-specification to prevent brittle tests sensitive to irrelevant changes.
- Use built-in or custom matchers to describe argument constraints succinctly.

### Actions — Define Behavior Clearly

- Use `WillOnce()` to specify behavior for specific calls.
- Use `WillRepeatedly()` to define default behavior after exhausting `WillOnce()` clauses.
- Leverage built-in actions like `Return()`, `ReturnRef()`, `SetArgPointee()`, or custom lambdas for complex needs.

### Cardinailities — Control Call Frequency

- Specify `.Times()` explicitly only when necessary to express call count expectations.
- Remember that `.Times()` can be inferred by the count of `WillOnce` and presence of `WillRepeatedly`.
- Use flexible cardinalities like `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)`, or `AnyNumber()` to express fuzzier constraints.

### Chaining Clauses — Follow Proper Order

Clause chaining must follow this order for correct behavior and syntax:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(matchers))
  .With(multi_arg_matcher)  // Optional, must come first if used
  .Times(cardinality)      // Optional; used once
  .InSequence(sequences...) // Optional; can be multiple
  .After(expectations...)  // Optional; can be multiple
  .WillOnce(action)        // Optional; multiple allowed
  .WillRepeatedly(action)  // Optional; only once
  .RetiresOnSaturation();  // Optional; only once, must be last
```

### Best Practice Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_, ::testing::Return, ::testing::AtLeast, ::testing::InSequence;

{
  InSequence s;  // Enforces call order

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(Ge(10), _))  // First arg >= 10, second ignored
    .Times(AtLeast(2))                      // Called at least twice
    .WillOnce(Return(42))                   // Return 42 first time
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(50));            // Return 50 thereafter

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Bar(_, Eq("test")))
    .Times(AnyNumber())
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(true));          // Called any number, returns true
}
```

## Strategies for Legacy or Complex Codebases

- **Minimize Mock Surface Area:** Only mock interfaces and methods you own or have explicitly designed for mocking to reduce fragility.
- **Use Delegation to Fakes:** For complex behaviors, delegate to a fake implementation for default actions, and override only needed behaviors in tests.
- **Apply Strictness Judiciously:** Avoid `StrictMock` unless you know every call must be controlled; else, test maintenance becomes costly.
- **Leverage `RetiresOnSaturation()`:** When precise call counts matter but calls should not linger as active expectations, use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to automatically deactivate expectations on saturation; helps prevent upper-bound violated errors.
- **Use `InSequence` and `After` to Specify Call Order:** To manage expectations across multiple mocks or calls, use sequences and explicit ordering to avoid brittle tests and clarify test intent.

<Info>
**Practical tip:** In legacy scenarios where mocks receive frequent but irrelevant calls, start with `NiceMock` and add targeted `EXPECT_CALL` statements with matchers and actions to verify critical interactions without flooding logs with warnings or failures.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### Tests Fail Due to Uninterested Calls
- Check if you can replace regular mocks with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings and failures.
- If unexpected calls truly represent errors, add specific `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(0)` to disallow them explicitly.

### Over-Specified Matchers
- Avoid specifying argument values that are irrelevant to the test.
- Prefer using `_` matcher or matchers that express intent rather than exact values.

### Unexpected Ordering Failures
- Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects with `.InSequence()` to enforce call order only when needed.
- Avoid ordering constraints in every test unless call order is critical.

### Actions Running Out
- Ensure you have enough `WillOnce` actions or provide a `WillRepeatedly` action to avoid default action usage that might not be intended.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` where appropriate to retire expectations after they are met.

### Mixing Nice/Strict Modes Incorrectly
- Avoid nested `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockType>>`; strictness wrappers only work correctly when applied once.
- Ensure mock classes have virtual destructors to prevent undefined behavior with these wrappers.
