# FAQ: Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

This page provides detailed information on the officially supported platforms, compilers, and build tools for GoogleTest. Understanding this compatibility ensures your development environment is correctly configured to build and run tests reliably with GoogleTest.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed for broad cross-platform compatibility. It officially supports:

- **Linux** (including various distributions and Android)
- **Windows** (Desktop versions, including MinGW)
- **macOS** (including iOS but with some platform-specific notes)

Other operating systems such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and certain BSD variants are also supported, though with varying degrees of feature completeness.

<Info>
To check compiled platform information programmatically, GoogleTest defines platform macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC` which can be inspected or used in your own test code to adjust behavior.
</Info>

---

## Compiler Support

GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports **C++17** or later. The following compilers and versions are supported:

- **GCC**: Version 7.3.0 and above
- **Clang**: Version 5.0 and above
- **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)**: Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.7 and later
- **Intel C++ Compiler**: Compatible versions supporting C++17

### Key Requirements

- The compiler must support C++17 features.
- RTTI and exceptions support is recommended but can be adjusted via macros.
- On Windows, GoogleTest handles CRT linkage nuances, and matching the C runtime linkage between your project and GoogleTest is critical. For example, use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align dynamic/static CRT linkage.

<Warning>
Compilers that do not support C++17 will not be able to build or use GoogleTest. Attempting to build with unsupported compilers will result in build errors.
</Warning>

---

## Build Tools Compatibility

- **CMake** (recommended): GoogleTest provides CMake build scripts that support importing the library either as a standalone project or embedded into your own CMake build using `add_subdirectory` or `FetchContent`.

  - CMake 3.14 or newer is required for the `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()` command used to download and build GoogleTest during your project’s configure step.
  - You can build GoogleTest with CMake using commands like:

    ```bash
    cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
    make
    sudo make install  # optional
    ```

- **Bazel**: GoogleTest includes Bazel build configurations for easy integration in Bazel projects.

- **Manual/Custom Build Systems**: Users can manually compile GoogleTest source files and include headers, but CMake or Bazel is strongly recommended.

<Note>
Visual Studio solutions and project files are automatically generated by CMake on Windows platforms.
</Note>

## Platform Abstractions and Portability

GoogleTest has a robust platform abstraction layer that:

- Detects the underlying OS and compiler capabilities.
- Provides threading and synchronization primitives (like Mutex and ThreadLocal) according to available platform features.
- Supports POSIX or Windows threading APIs where applicable.
- Abstracts filesystem operations and regex engines for cross-platform support.

By default, GoogleTest uses pthreads on compatible Unix-like systems and Windows threading APIs on Windows. You can override pthread usage flags with compile-time macros like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` if necessary.

---

## How to Check Compatibility in Your Environment

### Before Building

1. **Verify your compiler supports C++17.** For example, test with `g++ -std=c++17 --version`.
2. **Confirm your build tool version.** For CMake, ensure it is 3.14 or above.
3. **Check OS and architecture compatibility.** GoogleTest is tested extensively on common platforms.

### Build-Time Indicators

- CMake configuration output indicates platform and compiler detection.
- Macros defined internally (like `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` and `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) reflect your environment’s threading support.

<Tip>
When using Visual Studio, use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to avoid runtime library conflicts.

## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Questions and Problems">
<Accordion title="My build fails with 'C++17 not supported' errors — what should I do?">
Make sure you are using a compiler version known to support C++17 and that your build system passes the correct flags (e.g., `-std=c++17`). Check `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` if using CMake.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I see runtime library linkage conflicts on Windows — how can I fix this?">
Enable the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align GoogleTest’s CRT linkage with your project, avoiding linker errors caused by mixing static and dynamic CRT libraries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I verify that pthread support is enabled?">
GoogleTest defines the macro `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` as 1 when pthreads are detected and usable on your system. If it is 0, you may need to adjust your compiler/linker flags (e.g., add `-pthread`) or disable pthread usage explicitly using `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use GoogleTest with other compilers or embedded platforms?">
GoogleTest may build and partially operate on other compilers or embedded systems, but these are not officially supported. Lack of features like exceptions, threads, or file systems may cause issues.

## Summary

Ensuring compatibility of your development environment with GoogleTest is crucial for a smooth build and testing experience. This includes running on supported OSes (Linux, Windows, macOS, and many BSD variants), using C++17-capable compilers (such as GCC 7.3+, Clang 5.0+, MSVC 2017+), and leveraging supported build tools like CMake 3.14+ or Bazel.

## Practical Tips

- Always confirm your compiler version and C++ standard support before building.
- Use the CMake `FetchContent` method to automatically download and keep GoogleTest up to date within your project build.
- On Windows, carefully manage your CRT linkage settings using provided CMake options.
- Use GoogleTest environment macros (like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) to conditionally enable features or provide fallbacks in your tests.
