# Supported Compilers & Platforms

GoogleTest officially supports a comprehensive set of operating systems, compilers, and platforms to ensure broad applicability and reliable test execution across diverse development environments. This documentation clarifies which environments GoogleTest supports, highlights platform-specific considerations, and provides practical guidance to resolve common issues encountered during cross-platform integration or legacy environment usage.

---

## 1. Overview of Supported Platforms

GoogleTest aligns its platform support closely with Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Supported platforms encompass major desktop and server operating systems, popular compiler toolchains, and recognized hardware architectures.

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows (Desktop, MinGW variants), macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX
- **Mobile and Embedded OS:** Limited support—iOS, Android for core features; embedded platforms such as ESP32, ESP8266 have limited capabilities
- **UNIX derivatives:** DragonFlyBSD, GNU/Hurd, Fuchsia (not officially supported)

### Important Notes:
- Some platforms (e.g., Fuchsia) are not officially supported but can be built and used with community effort.
- GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler environment.

For a comprehensive, up-to-date table of supported compilers, platforms, and toolchains, see the official [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires at least C++17 support and has been tested extensively with the following compiler families:

- **GCC:** 7.x and newer
- **Clang:** Compatible versions supporting C++17
- **MSVC:** Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 14.1) and later
- **Intel LLVM:** Supported on platforms that supply a compatible Clang infrastructure

### Compiler Feature Highlights

- GoogleTest automatically detects Exception Handling, RTTI, threading, and Unicode support macros to enable or disable features accordingly.
- For MSVC, GoogleTest opts for stricter warning levels by default and can be tuned for static or dynamic runtime linkage.


---

## 3. Platform-Specific Considerations

### Threading and Pthreads

- POSIX threads (*pthreads*) are used where available, typically on UNIX-like systems such as Linux, macOS, BSD variants.
- MinGW on Windows does **not** use pthreads due to compatibility issues; native Windows threading primitives are employed instead.
- The macro `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` flags pthread availability to conditionally enable threading features.

### Exception and RTTI Support

- GoogleTest checks for exception support (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) and RTTI enablement (`GTEST_HAS_RTTI`) at compile time.
- Some cross-platform issues may arise if exceptions or RTTI are disabled; configuring GoogleTest appropriately is necessary.

### Stream Redirection and Death Tests

- Stream redirection is necessary for capturing output during tests and certain death test features.
- Support for this is disabled on limited embedded targets (like Windows Mobile, certain embedded platforms) or where file system support is absent.

### File System Support

- Presence of file system capabilities is essential for some GoogleTest features.
- Embedded or constrained platforms without a file system will have limited functionality.

### Wide String and Encoding

- Wide string (`std::wstring`) is supported on most desktop and server platforms but may not be available or stable on some embedded systems.
- Windows platforms and Cygwin treat wide strings as UTF-16 encoded.

## 4. Common Issues & Fixes

### Cross-Platform Integration

- **Build System Compatibility:** CMake is the recommended system for building GoogleTest, providing consistent platform detection and flag configuration.
- When cross-compiling, users must set environment variables like `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR`, `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` to ensure correct header and library paths.
- GoogleTest's pkg-config files include threading flags and macros like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` which are critical for correct compilation.

### Handling Legacy or Unsupported Environments

- For older compilers lacking full C++17 compliance, build will fail early. Upgrade compilers or use supported versions.
- On platforms with partial support (e.g., embedded targets), disable unsupported features explicitly to avoid build and runtime errors.

### Runtime Linking Issues on Windows

- GoogleTest uses static runtime linking by default on MSVC.
- To avoid linker errors between dynamic and static runtime linking, use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime usage with your project.

### Macros and Feature Flags

- Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to explicitly disable threading features if your platform does not support it.
- Use `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building or linking GoogleTest as a shared library.

## 5. How GoogleTest Detects Platforms & Features

GoogleTest uses carefully designed internal macros based on compiler, OS, and environment detection:

- OS detection macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC` determine platform capabilities.
- Feature macros such as `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`, `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` configure test framework behavior accordingly.
- This abstraction ensures GoogleTest can enable or disable platform-specific implementation details transparently to users.

### User Overrides

- Users can override detection macros by setting them explicitly, e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`.
- This is useful in custom or cross-compilation environments.

## 6. Practical Recommendations

### Before Building and Running Tests:

1. **Check Compiler and Platform Compatibility:** Confirm your build environment meets the minimum compiler and OS versions.
2. **Use CMake for Building:** Prefer CMake-based builds for robust platform and flag management.
3. **Set Required Environment Variables:** For cross-compiling or custom installs, set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`, and sysroot variables as needed.
4. **Configure Runtime Linking Correctly:** On Windows, align CRT usage with your project using `gtest_force_shared_crt`.
5. **Disable Unsupported Features When Needed:** Use compiler defines to disable exceptions, RTTI, or pthreads if unsupported.

### When Encountering Build Failures:

- Examine compiler error messages for missing threading or exception support.
- Confirm your compiler configuration aligns with GoogleTest’s expected flags in `cmake/internal_utils.cmake`.
- Refer to the [Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/common-setup-issues.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.
