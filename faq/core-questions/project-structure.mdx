# Understanding Project Structure and Integration

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are integral tools for writing C++ unit tests and mock objects, respectively. This page guides you through organizing your project layout to incorporate these frameworks properly, clarifies how to include and link necessary headers and libraries, and offers best practices for seamless integration and test organization.

---

## Typical Project Layouts

A well-structured project makes integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock straightforward while keeping your test code modular and maintainable.

### Common Layout Approaches

- **Separate Test Directory:**
  Maintain a distinct `tests/` or `test/` directory within your source tree solely for test code, isolating test-specific files from production code.

- **Embedded Tests Next to Source Files:**
  Place test files adjacent to the source files they test, often using different file extensions or naming conventions like `foo.cpp` and `foo_test.cpp`.

- **Mixed Layout:**
  Combine both approaches, separating larger test suites but grouping small unit tests nearby to their implementation.

### Recommended Structure Example
```
/project-root
  /src                 # Production code source files
    foo.cpp
    bar.cpp
  /include             # Header files
    foo.h
    bar.h
  /tests               # Test source files
    foo_test.cpp       # GoogleTest unit tests
    bar_test.cpp
    mocks/             # GoogleMock mock classes
      mock_foo.cpp
  CMakeLists.txt       # Build configuration
```

This layout clearly distinguishes production code from tests, making it easier to manage, build, and scale.

## Integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock Into Your Source Tree

There are several viable strategies for incorporating GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your project, each with trade-offs in flexibility, maintenance, and build complexity.

### 1. Using Installed Libraries and Headers

If you have installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock on your system (e.g., via package managers or manual install), your project can simply reference these via `find_package` in CMake or equivalent in other build systems.

```cmake
find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_tests test/foo_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gtest GTest::gmock GTest::gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

**Advantages:** Easy to manage, keeps your codebase clean.

**Disadvantages:** Updates rely on system libraries, less control over versions.

### 2. Embedding GoogleTest Source Directly

You can add GoogleTest (and GoogleMock) source code directly in your project source tree, commonly using:

- Git submodules
- Direct copy of source
- Fetching using CMake's `FetchContent`

This allows building GoogleTest alongside your code, using the same compiler settings, ensuring ABI compatibility.

**Example CMake snippet:**
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/v1.17.0.tar.gz
)
# Sets runtime linkage on Windows to match project
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test/foo_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main gmock_main)
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

**Advantages:** Builds with consistent settings, easier CI integration.

**Disadvantages:** Slightly more complex setup, source tree grows.

## Including Headers and Linking

To effectively write and compile tests, you need to correctly include GoogleTest/GoogleMock headers and link their libraries.

### Headers

- Include GoogleTest headers with:
  ```cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>
  ```
- For GoogleMock features, include:
  ```cpp
  #include <gmock/gmock.h>
  ```

Both headers bring in essential declarations and setup.

### Linking Libraries

Link against appropriate libraries depending on your build setup:

| Scenario                            | Libraries to Link                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Using Installed GTest/GMock        | `GTest::gtest`, `GTest::gmock`, and optionally `GTest::gtest_main` |
| Building from source with FetchContent | `gtest_main`, `gmock_main` or `gtest`, `gmock` if customized |

**Note:** Linking `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` provides a main() implementation that runs all tests, simplifying the test binary.

---

## Finding Headers and Libraries

Build systems typically locate GoogleTest/GoogleMock through:

- **`find_package()`**: Works when GoogleTest is installed on the system.
- **`add_subdirectory()`**: For building GoogleTest as part of your project.
- **`FetchContent` or other download methods**: Automates dependency fetching.

You may need to specify include directories and library paths explicitly if your build system cannot find them automatically.

---

## Organizing Your Tests for Best Practices

To maintain clarity and ease of maintenance:

- **Group related tests into test suites** using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- **Use test fixtures** to share common setup and teardown.
- **Separate mocks into distinct files/directories** to avoid cluttering test code.
- **Name test files clearly** to indicate their purpose (e.g., `foo_test.cpp`).
- **Keep production and test dependencies isolated** in your build.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="FAQ - Project Structure and Integration">
<Accordion title="How do I add GoogleTest to my existing CMake project?">
The simplest approach is to use CMake's `FetchContent` module (requires CMake 3.14+) to download GoogleTest during configuration and then link your test executables against it. Alternatively, install GoogleTest system-wide and use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I build GoogleTest and GoogleMock as shared libraries?">
Yes. You can compile GoogleTest with `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and link your tests with `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`. This approach requires managing shared library paths appropriately.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where should I put my test source files?">
A common pattern is to create a dedicated `tests/` directory within your project root. This cleanly separates test code from production code and eases build setup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I avoid macro conflicts with GoogleTest?">
If GoogleTest macros conflict with another library, define the appropriate control macros (such as `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`) to rename conflicting macros. You'll then use the renamed macros like `GTEST_TEST` instead of `TEST`.
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

### Compiler and Linking Errors
- **Missing Headers**: Ensure your include paths point to GoogleTest's `include` directories.
- **Undefined References**: Check that you link against both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries as needed.
- **Runtime Errors**: Verify that your test binary links with `gtest_main` or provide your own `main()`.

### Build Mismatches
- On Windows, incompatible runtime linkage (dynamic vs static) can cause linker errors. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to synchronize runtime linkage with your project.

---

## Useful Tips

- Always keep GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions aligned.
- Leverage CMake's built-in support and conventions for GoogleTest to minimize manual configuration.
- Organize mocks in separate files to improve readability.
- Write small, focused tests grouped logically in suites.
