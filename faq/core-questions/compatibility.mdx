# What platforms and C++ standards are supported?

This page clarifies the operating systems, compilers, and required C++ standards supported by the latest releases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It guides users in understanding compatibility and resolving any platform or compiler concerns when starting fresh or upgrading their testing environment.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock adhere to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and officially support a broad array of platforms, including but not limited to:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (Desktop variants and MSVC toolchain)
- Other UNIX-like OSes as applicable

For the most up-to-date matrix of currently supported compilers, platforms, and build tools, refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) table.

> This ensures that GoogleTest/GoogleMock works reliably in environments matching Google's internal platform requirements and widely-used developer setups.

## Supported Compilers and C++ Standards

To build and use the GoogleTest and GoogleMock frameworks effectively, your compiler must meet the following minimum requirements:

- **C++ Standard**: Full support for **C++17** or later is required. Older C++ standards are not supported.

- **Compiler Versions**:
  - **GCC**: Any recent version fully supporting C++17 (typically GCC 7 or higher)
  - **Clang**: Any recent version with C++17 support enabled
  - **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: Version 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.14) or newer. Google Mock requires at least Visual C++ 2015 for compilation.

- **Exception Handling**: Exceptions are recommended but GoogleTest is designed to work regardless.

- **RTTI**: Runtime Type Information (RTTI) support is expected; some features rely on RTTI availability.

- **Other compiler features**:
  - Support for variadic templates, constexpr, and modern template features used by GoogleMock.

## Notes on Platform and Compiler Compatibility

- GoogleTest detects the platform and compiler environment via dedicated macros within internal headers (`gtest-port.h` and `gmock-port.h`). These determine feature availability and ensure platform-specific behavior is correct.

- On supported platforms, GoogleTest enables features such as POSIX threading, exception support, and file system access.

- On Windows, the framework supports MSVC's latest compilers with Windows targeting.

- If your environment does not meet these standards (for example, C++14 or earlier, or unsupported compiler versions), you will encounter compilation errors or unsupported functionality warnings.

## How to Verify Your Environment Compatibility

To confirm your environment supports GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

1. **Check Compiler Version:** Run your compiler's version command (e.g., `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or check Visual Studio version).

2. **Confirm C++17 Selection:** Make sure your project's build flags specify C++17 or later (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang, `/std:c++17` for MSVC).

3. **Confirm Supported Platform Macros:** GoogleTest's internal headers use well-defined macros like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, and `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` to detect platform and features. Compilation failing with unsupported macro errors usually indicates incompatibility.

4. **Successful Compilation & Linking:** If your test program including `<gmock/gmock.h>` compiles and links successfully, your environment is supported.

## Common Compatibility Concerns & Solutions

<AccordionGroup title="Compatibility FAQ and Tips">
<Accordion title="Why does my compiler complain about C++ standard version?">
If you get errors related to unsupported language features, ensure your build is configured to use C++17 or later. This typically involves setting the appropriate compiler flags. For example, in CMake, set:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Older compilers might not fully support C++17 features required by GoogleMock.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are older operating systems like Windows 7 supported?">
While GoogleTest supports Windows desktop platforms, some features depend on system capabilities (like threads and file system APIs). Use the latest stable Visual Studio with the MSVC compiler for best compatibility. Some older OS versions may have limitations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use GoogleMock with cross-compilation or embedded systems?">
Support for embedded or special-purpose platforms is limited. GoogleMock relies on standard C++17 features and commonly available platform APIs. For deeply embedded or non-standard OSes, compatibility must be evaluated case by case.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What about thread safety and concurrency support?">
Google Test and Mock assume availability of threading support on the target platform. POSIX threads are used on UNIX-like systems and Windows threading APIs on Windows. If your platform lacks threading or uses an unsupported threading model, expect limited or no support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock require **C++17** or later.
- Supported compilers include recent versions of GCC, Clang, and MSVC (VS2017 Update 3+).
- Supported platforms include Linux, macOS, Windows, and other major UNIX variants.
- Internal macros detect and adapt to platform features.

## Step-by-step Compatibility Verification

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Compiler Version and C++ Standard">
Check that your compiler supports C++17 by running version commands and inspecting build flags.
</Step>
<Step title="Confirm Operating System Support">
Ensure you are building on a supported platform such as Linux, Windows (MSVC), or macOS.
</Step>
<Step title="Compile a Simple Test Program">
Write and build a minimal test including <code>&lt;gmock/gmock.h&gt;</code> to check for compilation errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Test Binary">
Run your test executable; if it runs without linking errors, compatibility is confirmed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Always keep your compiler and system development tools up to date to ensure smooth integration with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, as the C++ standards and compiler capabilities evolve.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

- Compilation error about missing C++17 support: Set compiler flag to enable C++17.
- Linker error missing symbols from gMock or gTest: Check linking against correct libraries (gmock, gmock_main, gtest).
- Runtime crashes or undefined behavior: Verify platform compatibility, threading support, and use recommended compiler versions.
