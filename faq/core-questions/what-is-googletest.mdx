# What is GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are two essential C++ testing frameworks that have been unified into a single robust library to facilitate writing and running tests effectively in C++ projects. Together, they provide a comprehensive solution for both test verification and mocking dependencies, allowing developers to produce reliable, maintainable, and scalable test suites.

## Overview of GoogleTest

GoogleTest is a mature C++ testing framework designed by Google to support a wide range of testing needs — from simple unit tests to complex integration tests. It promotes writing independent and repeatable tests, organizes tests into suites, and offers rich assertion macros that clearly communicate test failures.

### Key Features of GoogleTest:

- **Automatic Test Discovery:** You define your tests using macros, and GoogleTest automatically registers and runs them.
- **Rich Set of Assertions:** Includes assertions for equality, inequality, exceptions, string and floating-point comparisons, and more.
- **Test Fixtures:** Allows grouping tests that share the same setup and teardown logic.
- **Parameterized Tests:** Supports running the same tests with multiple inputs without code duplication.
- **Value and Type Parameterization:** Enables testing across a range of values or types using `TEST_P`, `TYPED_TEST`, and related macros.
- **Support for Death Tests:** Allows verifying abnormal program terminations or crashes.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and Mac.

GoogleTest is the backbone for writing and managing tests in C++ and is valued for its clarity, ease of use, and integration capabilities.

## Overview of GoogleMock

GoogleMock is an extension built on top of GoogleTest, focused on creating mock objects and setting expectations on method calls. It is designed to replace real dependencies in tests with controlled, programmable substitutes that verify behavior and isolate units under test.

### GoogleMock Capabilities:

- **Mock Class Generation:** Create mocks for interfaces or concrete classes using simple macros.
- **Flexible Expectations:** Specify calls expected on mocks, including arguments matching and call counts.
- **Actions for Call Behavior:** Define what happens when mocked methods are called, such as returning values or invoking custom functions.
- **Support for Templates and Overloads:** Handles complex mock method signatures.
- **Strictness Modes:** Control whether unexpected calls cause failures, or are allowed silently.

Together with GoogleTest’s assertion and test execution framework, GoogleMock enables precise control and verification of interactions with dependencies.

## Consolidation into One Framework

Originally separate projects, GoogleTest and GoogleMock have been merged into a single repository, sharing the same versioning and release schedule. This unified library:

- Simplifies dependency management.
- Ensures compatibility and integration between testing and mocking.
- Provides a streamlined user experience with a single include and library.

Users include `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` to access all GoogleTest and GoogleMock features.

## How They Fit Into C++ Software Development

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide the foundation for modern, test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD) in C++. They help teams to:

- Protect code quality by automating verification.
- Reduce bugs by catching regressions early.
- Simplify refactoring by ensuring code contracts remain intact.
- Enable modular design by decoupling components through mocks.
- Support continuous integration pipelines with automated test execution and reporting.

Their widespread adoption by large projects and open source communities underscores their reliability and effectiveness.

## Example Usage

### Writing a Simple Test with GoogleTest

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Tests that factorial of 0 is 1.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

// Tests factorial of positive numbers.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Defining a Mock Class with GoogleMock

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int GetBar() = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetBar, (), (override));
};

TEST(FooTest, ReturnsBarValue) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetBar())
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetBar(), 42);
}
```

This shows how tests and mocks work together to verify code logic and interactions.

<Tip>
To get started quickly, link your test executable with the `gtest_main` library, which provides a default `main()` function, so you don’t have to write one.
</Tip>

<Note>
When writing tests, prefer `EXPECT_*` macros to catch multiple failures in one run, but use `ASSERT_*` macros when a failure should stop test execution.
</Note>

<Callout>
Remember, GoogleTest and GoogleMock both require C++17 or newer. Ensure your build environment meets this prerequisite.
</Callout>
