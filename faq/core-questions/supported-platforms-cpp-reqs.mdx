# Supported Platforms and C++ Versions

This page provides detailed, authoritative guidance on which platforms, compilers, and C++ language standards are compatible with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. The information here helps you ensure your development environment is properly aligned for a successful build and test experience.

---

## 1. Overview of Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This policy defines minimum supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build tools that maintain security, compatibility, and performance requirements.

For a comprehensive and always up-to-date matrix of supported platforms, refer to the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Supported Operating Systems

- **Desktop OS:**
  - Windows (including Desktop versions, MinGW)
  - macOS
  - Linux (including various distributions)
  - BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
  - Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS

- **Mobile and Embedded OS:**
  - iOS
  - Android (with NDK)
  - Google Native Client (NaCl)
  - Some embedded targets: ESP32, ESP8266, NXP QN9090, NRF52

- **Specialized and Less Common Systems:**
  - Fuchsia
  - GNU/Hurd
  - Haiku
  - QNX
  - Windows RT, Windows Phone

### Platform Detection Macros

GoogleTest internally detects platforms via macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and `GTEST_OS_LINUX`. These facilitate platform-specific handling to ensure seamless operation across environments.

## 2. C++ Language Standard Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require **C++17** or later.

- The build system must be configured to use **at least C++17**.
- This requirement ensures the use of modern language features and library std components necessary for internal implementations.

### Compiler Support

To satisfy the C++17 requirement, the following compiler minimum versions are supported:

| Compiler        | Minimum Supported Version |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| GCC             | 7.4+                       |
| Clang           | 5.0+                       |
| MS Visual C++   | 2017 (14.0)+               |

These versions ensure compatibility with C++17 language features and correct runtime behavior.

### Build Flags

When building with CMake, GoogleTest enforces the C++17 standard with:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

If you are integrating GoogleTest in a non-CMake environment, make sure to pass the appropriate compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or `/std:c++17` for MSVC.

### Compiler Diagnostics

GoogleTestâ€™s internal headers (include `<gtest/internal/gtest-port.h>`) check that the provided C++ language version is C++17 or newer and will generate a compile-time error when it is not.

```cpp
#if !defined(GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG) || \
    GTEST_INTERNAL_CPLUSPLUS_LANG < 201703L
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
#endif
```

This early validation prevents confusing errors downstream.

## 3. Threading and Platform Features

- Thread safety is supported where the platform and compiler provide threading libraries. GoogleTest uses pthreads on POSIX platforms and native Windows threading mechanisms otherwise.
- Thread-safety support macro: `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` is defined to 1 when threading is supported.
- If pthread detection is incorrect, it can be overridden with the macro:

  ```bash
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1   # Enable pthread support
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0   # Disable pthread support
  ```

- Certain platform capabilities like regular expressions, file system access, and stream redirection are auto-detected, enabling or disabling features such as death tests accordingly.

---

## 4. Platform-specific Caveats and Notes

- MS Visual C++ must be version 2015 or newer to compile GoogleMock successfully.
- Windows builds handle runtime differences and warn about dynamic vs static runtime linking; configuration flags and CMake options (`gtest_force_shared_crt`) help manage these.
- Some embedded platforms (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32) have limited support and lack some OS features; some tests or features might be constrained.

---

## 5. How to Verify Your Environment

1. Check compiler version and ensure it meets or exceeds the stated minimum.
2. Confirm your build system sets the C++ standard to 17 or newer.
3. On POSIX systems, verify pthreads availability for threading support.
4. Confirm platform detection macros if you suspect misdetection.
5. Use the GoogleTest configuration validation guides ([Configuration Validation](/getting-started/installation-guide/configuration-validation)) for practical steps.

## 7. Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a development environment with C++17 support, a modern compiler (GCC 7.4+, Clang 5.0+, MSVC 2017+), and run on major desktop, server, and some embedded platforms. The build system will configure flags accordingly, enforcing C++17 compliance. GoogleTest auto-detects platform traits and enables features conditionally to maximize compatibility and reliability.

For seamless integration, always verify your development environment matches the listed requirements before building or running tests with GoogleTest or GoogleMock.

---

<Check>
Ensure your compiler version and C++ standard settings conform before building to avoid build errors related to unsupported platforms or language versions.
</Check>

<Warning>
GoogleMock requires MSVC 2015 or later due to language features; older MSVC versions will fail at compile time.
</Warning>
