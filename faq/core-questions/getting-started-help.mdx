# How do I get started with GoogleTest?

Welcome to GoogleTest, Google’s unified C++ testing and mocking framework. If you’re new to GoogleTest, this guide will help you begin your journey smoothly by introducing key beginner-friendly resources and explaining the documentation structure designed for effective onboarding.

---

## Getting Started: Your First Steps

GoogleTest is designed to help you write clear, robust, and portable C++ tests with minimal fuss. To get started quickly:

1. **Read the GoogleTest Primer:** This is a beginner-centric introduction that explains how to write simple tests, understand core concepts, and run them. It covers everything from writing your first assertions to test fixtures.

2. **Explore Sample Tests:** Familiarize yourself with real-world examples that illustrate GoogleTest’s syntax and usage patterns for both simple and complex tests.

3. **Write Your First Test:** Follow guided instructions on writing, building, and running test binaries, so you can see GoogleTest in action on your own machine.

4. **Understand Assertions and Test Results:** Learn how assertions work to diagnose your code behavior and interpret test output for faster debugging.

## Overview of Beginner Resources

- **GoogleTest Primer:** Start here to get a solid foundation in writing GoogleTest tests with practical explanations and examples.

- **GoogleMock for Dummies:** If your testing requires mocks, this resource demystifies how to create and use mock objects effectively.

- **Sample Tests:** Browse valuable examples demonstrating best practices and common test scenarios.

- **Installation & Setup Guides:** Before running tests, see instructions on how to install GoogleTest correctly on various platforms using CMake, Bazel, or other build systems.

- **Documentation Structure:** The docs are segmented into intuitive categories like Getting Started, Guides, API Reference, and FAQs to support your learning curve.

## How This Documentation Fits Together

GoogleTest documentation is organized to facilitate progressive learning:

- **Getting Started Tab:** Focuses on installing the framework, building your first tests, and troubleshooting installation issues.

- **Guides Tab:** Offers detailed writing techniques for tests, mocking strategies, and organizing test suites.

- **API Reference:** Provides comprehensive details for GoogleTest APIs with examples.

- **Concepts Tab:** Deep dives into underlying architecture, concepts, and testing models for growing expertise.

- **FAQ:** Quickly find answers to common questions and challenges as you use GoogleTest.

## Step-by-Step: Writing Your First Test

Here is the basic workflow from the user perspective:

<Steps>
<Step title="Define a Test">
Write a simple test function using the `TEST()` macro with a test suite name and test name.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Assertions">
Inside your test, use `EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*` macros to check your code’s behavior.
</Step>
<Step title="Build Your Test Program">
Compile your test file with GoogleTest linked, either by using CMake or your preferred build system.
</Step>
<Step title="Run the Tests">
Execute the test binary to see which tests pass or fail.
</Step>
<Step title="Refine and Expand">
Add test fixtures with `TEST_F()` to reuse setup among tests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips for Getting Started

- **Use `EXPECT_` over `ASSERT_` when possible** to allow multiple checks per test.
- **Organize tests into test suites** that logically group related functionality.
- **Leverage test fixtures** for common shared setup and teardown code.
- **Link to `gtest_main`** to avoid writing your own `main()` function unless you need custom setup.
- **Call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` once** in `main()` to execute all registered tests.

## Common Pitfalls for New Users

- Forgetting to call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` in `main()`.
- Misnaming test suites and tests with invalid C++ identifiers or using underscores where discouraged.
- Writing `SetUp()` as `Setup()` (capitalization matters) in test fixtures.
- Overusing `ASSERT_*` macros in situations where it’s safe to continue checking more assertions for richer feedback.
- Not returning the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from `main()`, which can break automated test runners.
- Explicitly listing tests to run rather than relying on automatic registration.

## Troubleshooting

- If tests don’t run or are not discovered, ensure `main()` correctly initializes GoogleTest.
- Confirm your build system includes the right GoogleTest libraries and headers.
- Check naming conventions of test suites and test names.
- Review compiler and OS compatibility.

## Next Steps

Once comfortable with writing and running simple tests:

- Explore **Advanced GoogleTest** features for parameterized, typed, and death tests.
- Dive into **Mocking Techniques** to isolate code dependencies and enhance test coverage.
- Review **Assertions Reference** to unlock the full expressive power of GoogleTest’s assertions.
