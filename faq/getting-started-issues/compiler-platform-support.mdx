# Compiler and Platform Compatibility

This page clarifies which compilers and platforms are officially supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock, guides you on addressing version mismatches, and points to where to check for the latest compatibility updates. It references Google's foundational support policies and offers troubleshooting advice for unsupported or problematic environments.

---

## Supported Compilers and Platform Overview

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17-compliant environment to build and run correctly. It officially supports the major operating systems and compilers listed in accordance with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Key Supported Platforms
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (including various distributions), Windows Desktop, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, and select embedded platforms.
- **Compilers:**
  - GCC versions 7 and above with full C++17 support
  - Clang 5 and above
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.3) and later
  - Intel C++ Compiler compatible with the above standards

### Build Tools and Integration
- CMake (version 3.14 or later) is the primary supported build system with detailed instructions to incorporate GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Common CI platforms and IDEs are supported given these compiler and platform constraints.

### Threading Support
- Platforms with POSIX `pthread` support enable GoogleTest’s thread-safe tests.
- Windows platforms use their native thread primitives.

### Core Requirements
- GoogleTest mandates a compiler that supports at least C++17.
- RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) and exceptions are generally required for full GoogleTest functionality, though some configurations can adjust these.

## Detecting and Managing Version or Compatibility Issues

### Handling Compiler Mismatches
- If your compiler version does not meet the minimum C++17 standard, you must upgrade to a supported version. GoogleTest will not build on unsupported compiler versions.
- On MSVC platforms, builds prior to Visual Studio 2015 are not supported.
- Using the provided CMake build scripts ensures that minimum requirements are checked and relevant flags set.

### Common Symptoms of Compatibility Problems
- Build errors indicating missing C++17 features.
- Linker errors related to runtime mismatches (especially on Windows).
- Runtime failures or unexpected test behavior due to incompatible threading or platform support.

### Recommended Actions
- Use the official GoogleTest CMake setup to automatically enforce compatibility flags.
- For Windows, match runtime linkage (dynamic vs. static) between your project and GoogleTest using the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option.
- Define or override macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` to reflect your environment correctly.

## Checking and Updating Compatibility Status

GoogleTest’s compatibility evolves alongside compiler and platform support:

- Visit the official [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) to confirm current supported compiler and platform versions.
- Review the [GoogleTest README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md) and release notes for any updates to platform support.
- Follow the [Upgrade & Migration Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/changelog/release-highlights/upgrade-guide.mdx) for major breaking changes affecting compiler or platform requirements.

Stay informed of new releases and check your build environment periodically to ensure compatibility.

## Foundational Support Policies

GoogleTest adheres to Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), which means:

- Support focuses on modern C++ standards and actively maintained compiler versions.
- Older compilers or platforms without C++17 support are not supported.
- Users working on non-standard or legacy environments may encounter unsupported scenarios.

This reinforces GoogleTest’s goals for portability, maintainability, and leveraging modern C++ capabilities.

---

## Troubleshooting Unsupported or Problematic Scenarios

### 1. Unsupported Compiler Versions
- Upgrade compiler to a supported version or switch to a supported alternative.
- Review the compiler error messages early in the build process; they typically indicate missing C++17 feature support.

### 2. Runtime Linkage Mismatches on Windows
- Ensure that your test and GoogleTest use consistent runtime libraries (static vs dynamic). Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align.

### 3. Missing Thread Support
- If your platform does not have or misdetects pthread support, define `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` or `1` explicitly on the command line.
- Ensure linking with pthread libraries if required.

### 4. Flags or Macro Conflicts
- Use custom `gtest-port.h` and `gmock-port.h` for advanced configuration and flags tweaking.
- Avoid macro name clashes by disabling default GoogleTest macro definitions if necessary.

### 5. Platform-Specific Limitations
- Embedded or limited OS platforms might not support all GoogleTest features.
- Verify platform feature macros defined in `gtest-port.h` for capabilities such as file systems, stream redirection, and exceptions support.

## Practical Tips for Maintaining Compatibility

- Always consult and use the provided CMake build scripts to manage compiler flags and platform features correctly.
- Regularly update your dependencies and compilers to align with GoogleTest’s baseline support requirements.
- Use `testing::InitGoogleTest()` to initialize GoogleTest with proper flag handling.
- Check your environment macros (such as `GTEST_OS_*`, `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) when troubleshooting environment-related issues.

## Example: Common CMake Flags for Compatibility

Here is an example snippet you might see or use in your CMake setup to assure compatibility:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTestProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Use GoogleTest source as subdirectory or find installed package
add_subdirectory(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)

# Force shared CRT on Windows to avoid runtime mismatch
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "Force shared MSVC runtime for GoogleTest")

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

## Summary

Maintaining a modern, supported compiler and platform environment aligned with GoogleTest recommendations is critical to leveraging the full power and reliability of the framework. Use the official resources and build tools provided, update environments regularly, and consult this page and related documentation whenever you face compatibility challenges.
