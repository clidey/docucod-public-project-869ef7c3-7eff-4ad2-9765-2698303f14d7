# Installation & Compatibility Troubleshooting

This page provides clear and actionable solutions to issues encountered during the installation of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses specifically on compatibility problems such as compiler requirements, C++17 standard support, and common errors that may arise. You’ll also find guidance on verifying platform compatibility and locating version information to facilitate effective troubleshooting.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does the installation fail with complaints about C++17 support?

GoogleTest requires a compiler and build environment that support C++17 or later. If your installation fails during compilation, first verify your compiler version and its support for C++17 features.

**How to check:**
- Run your compiler with the flag `--version` or equivalent to confirm its version.
- Consult the [System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-requirements/system-requirements) page to confirm if your compiler version supports C++17.
- Ensure that your build system (e.g., CMake) is configured to use C++17. For CMake, this commonly includes setting:
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

**Tip:** In mixed-language projects or complex builds, verify that all compilation units use compatible C++ standards to avoid subtle errors.

---

### What platforms and compilers are officially supported?

Refer to the [Supported Platforms & Compatibility](/overview/integration-platforms/supported-platforms) page, which details the officially supported operating systems and compilers according to Google’s foundational C++ support policy.

Here are key highlights:
- Linux distributions with GCC 7 or later and Clang 5 or later
- Windows with MSVC 2017 or later
- MacOS with Apple Clang versions supporting C++17

Always verify your environment matches these recommended platforms. For unsupported environments, consider custom configurations but expect to encounter challenges.

### I get "undefined reference" errors related to GoogleTest symbols. What should I do?

These errors commonly occur when the linker cannot find GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries.

**Solutions:**
- Make sure your build links against `gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, or `gmock_main` as appropriate.
- Use the recommended linking sequence to include dependencies correctly.
  For example, when using CMake:
  ```cmake
  target_link_libraries(your_test_target gmock_main)  # links both gmock and gtest
  ```
- Confirm that your `include` paths and library paths are correctly set.

Also, ensure you are not mixing debug and release builds which can cause symbol mismatches.

---

### How can I verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are initialized properly?

Typically, linking with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` provides a default `main()` function, so you don't need to write your own. GoogleMock initializes GoogleTest internally.

If you define your own `main()`, ensure you call:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Calling `InitGoogleMock()` also calls `InitGoogleTest()`. Omitting this causes tests not to register or run correctly.

---

### Why am I seeing warnings or errors about "uninteresting function call encountered"?

When a mock method is called without an explicit expectation set (i.e., without `EXPECT_CALL`), GoogleMock warns that the call was uninteresting. This is **not an error**, but an indication that the call was unexpected.

If the calls are admissible and should not generate warnings:

- Use `ON_CALL` in your mock object setup to specify default behaviors.
- Or use `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly allow such calls.

Increasing verbosity by running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` can help diagnose these warnings.

---

### How do I find the version of GoogleTest/GoogleMock I'm using?

Version information is exposed through the library version macros and tags but is often most visible in the GitHub repository or release notes.

For packaged installs:
- Most Linux package managers include version information.
- If building from source, check the `README.md` or `CMakeLists.txt` for the `GOOGLETEST_VERSION` variable.

For Git usage, running:

```shell
git describe --tags
```

inside the `googletest` directory shows the current version.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Compiler Does Not Support Required C++ Features

**Problem:** Your compiler does not support C++17 or throws errors about unsupported features.

**Solution:** Upgrade your compiler to a version supporting C++17. Confirm that your build flags enable C++17 as noted above.

### Linking Problems

**Problem:** Linker errors citing missing GoogleTest or GoogleMock symbols.

**Solution:** Check link library order, library location, and target link commands. Consider linking against `gmock_main` instead of just `gmock` or `gtest`.

### Conflicting Library Versions

**Problem:** Multiple versions of GoogleTest or GoogleMock in your build environment.

**Solution:** Clean your build fully, ensure only one version is referenced, and that includes and library paths are consistent.

### Platform-Specific Build Script Issues

**Problem:** CMake or build scripts fail under certain environments.

**Solution:** Refer to the [Installing with CMake](/getting-started/installation-initialization/installation-cmake) guide for recommended CMake usage. If needed, disable GoogleMock with `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` to build only GoogleTest.

Use the `hermetic_build.cmake` functions if you need isolated build environment configuration.

## Troubleshooting Setup and Environment

### Validating Your Build Environment

Before installation, verify that:
- The compiler supports at least C++17.
- Required tools such as CMake are installed and at compatible versions ([Prerequisite Tools and Dependencies](/getting-started/setup-requirements/prerequisites)).
- Your threading environment is detected correctly (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro).

### Handling Thread Safety Concerns

GoogleTest is thread-safe on systems supporting pthreads. On Windows or other platforms, thread safety may be limited. Consider setting

```cmake
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

if you are confident pthreads are available, to bypass incorrect detection.

### Identifying Build Errors

If your build fails due to missing headers or source files:
- Confirm you have obtained the full GoogleTest repository, including subdirectories like `googletest` and `googlemock`.
- If you build GoogleMock separately, ensure that GoogleTest sources are correctly referenced.
- Confirm environment variables and paths used by your build system.

---

## Best Practices for Installation and Initialization

- Use supported and up-to-date compilers.
- Always set the C++ standard explicitly to C++17.
- Prefer linking with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to avoid writing your own `main()`.
- Follow the recommended build workflows outlined in the [Installing with CMake](/getting-started/installation-initialization/installation-cmake) or [Manual Installation](/getting-started/installation-initialization/installation-manual) guides.
- Use continuous integration environments to detect incompatibilities early.
