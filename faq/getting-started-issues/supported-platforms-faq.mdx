# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

GoogleTest is designed to be a highly portable C++ testing framework, supporting a wide range of platforms, compilers, and build tools. This page details the officially supported environments and guides you on verifying compatibility for your current or planned projects.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).

This policy defines which platforms, operating systems, and compiler versions receive sustained testing and support, aligning with Google's internal engineering standards and industry best practices.

For an up-to-date list of officially supported compilers, versions, platforms, and build tools you can consult the summary table hosted here:

- [Google OSS Policies: Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

This matrix is regularly updated to reflect new version support or deprecations.


## Platform Support Highlights

- **Operating Systems:** Linux (various distributions), Windows Desktop, Mac OS X, and several Unix variants
- **Compilers:** GCC, Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio), Intel C++ compilers, and others as listed
- **Build Tools:** Native system build tools, CMake, Visual Studio solution (.sln) projects, Xcode projects, and more


## Verifying Compatibility for Your Projects

Before integrating GoogleTest into your project, ensure the following:

1. **Compiler Version Compatibility:** Verify that your compiler is listed as supported at the provided [support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

2. **Platform Matching:** Make sure your target platform (OS and architecture) appears in the list or is compatible with a supported platform.

3. **C++ Standard Support:** GoogleTest requires a minimum of **C++17** support for building successfully. You can ensure compliance by setting your build system:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

or by passing the appropriate compiler flags if not using CMake.

4. **Build System Suitability:** Confirm your build tooling can properly handle GoogleTestâ€™s build scripts (e.g., CMakeLists.txt).


## Notes on Cross-Platform Support

- GoogleTest's CMake scripts generate native builds for many platforms out of the box.
- On Windows, Visual Studio solution and project files are created automatically.
- On Mac OS X, an Xcode project is available.
- The integration accommodates both standalone builds of GoogleTest and incorporation into existing builds.


## Troubleshooting Platform Issues

If you encounter platform-specific issues:

- Consult the official support matrix for guidance.
- Check for any platform-specific build flags or environment variables discussed in [customization points](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md).
- Review build logs for incompatibility errors related to compiler or platform.
- Seek community or official support channels linked at the bottom of the documentation.


## Practical Example: Checking Your Compiler and Platform

For example, to confirm your compiler and platform are supported, you can:

- Identify your compiler version:

  ```bash
  gcc --version
  clang --version
  cl.exe (Visual Studio) # via Developer Command Prompt
  ```

- Search the foundational C++ support matrix for this compiler version.
- Ensure your OS version matches one listed or indicated as compatible.

## Summary

GoogleTest supports a broad spectrum of platforms and compilers following Google's foundational C++ support guidelines. Ensuring your development environment aligns with these specifications guarantees smooth building and reliable test execution.

<Tip>
Always check the up to date support matrix linked above before upgrading your compiler or switching platforms to ensure continued compatibility.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleTest mandates C++17 support; attempting to build with older standards will fail.
</Note>

<Warning>
Unsupported or untested platforms may compile but can exhibit unexpected behaviors or runtime failures.
</Warning>

<Check>
Verify your platform and compiler versions align with the listed supported environments prior to integration.

<AccordionGroup title="More About Platform Support">
<Accordion title="Where can I find the official platform support matrix?">
You can find the official platform support matrix compiled and maintained by Google here:

https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md

This matrix lists supported OSes, compiler versions, and build tools explicitly supported by GoogleTest and other Google C++ OSS projects.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does GoogleTest support embedded or mobile OS platforms?">
While GoogleTest prioritizes common desktop and server platforms, some embedded or mobile platforms may be partially supported. For instance, Android is supported with certain restrictions.

Check the matrix to confirm support status for such platforms, and consult customization guides for adjustments.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is the minimal C++ standard required to build GoogleTest?">
GoogleTest requires a compiler with support for at least C++17.

Older standards like C++11 or C++14 are not supported for building GoogleTest core.

This ensures modern language features for better type safety and cleaner implementation.
