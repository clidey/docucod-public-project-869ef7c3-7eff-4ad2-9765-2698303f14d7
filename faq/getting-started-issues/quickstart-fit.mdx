# Is GoogleTest/GoogleMock a Good Fit for My Project?

## Introduction

Choosing the right testing framework is crucial for building reliable, maintainable, and efficient software. This page helps you determine if GoogleTest and GoogleMock are the right tools for your project by addressing common evaluation questions, clarifying supported languages and platforms, and articulating key value propositions.

Whether you are starting a new C++ project or integrating tests into an existing codebase, understanding the fit of GoogleTest/GoogleMock will ensure that you leverage their capabilities effectively without surprises.

## Common Questions About Fit

### What programming languages does GoogleTest support?
GoogleTest is **exclusively designed for C++** projects. It supports writing tests for C++ code and integrates natively with C++ test programs. GoogleMock, as an extension, enables mocking within these C++ tests.


### Can I use GoogleTest for testing non-C++ code?
GoogleTest focuses on C++ testing. For other languages, consider language-specific frameworks. However, if your project has a C++ component or interface, GoogleTest can effectively test that part.


### Are GoogleTest and GoogleMock suitable for all sizes of projects?
Absolutely. GoogleTest and GoogleMock scale well from small libraries to large, complex systems. They offer features like test isolation, fixtures, and parameterized tests to maintain clarity and manageability as your test suite grows.


### Does GoogleTest/GoogleMock support all platforms?
Yes. GoogleTest is designed to be **platform-neutral**, supporting Linux, Windows, and Mac. It handles differences in compilers and environments, ensuring portability and reuse of tests regardless of your operating system.


### Will GoogleTest slow down my development or CI pipelines?
No. GoogleTest emphasizes **fast execution** and efficient test isolation to keep turnaround times minimal. Shared fixtures and proper structuring can further optimize performance.


### Can GoogleTest help with both unit and integration testing?
Yes. While GoogleTest is widely used for unit testing, it supports *any* kind of test, including integration and system-level tests. Its flexible assertion mechanisms and test grouping support a variety of testing styles.


### What if I want to mock dependencies in my tests?
GoogleMock integrates seamlessly with GoogleTest, providing powerful mocking capabilities to specify expected calls, behaviors, and verify interactions. This is especially advantageous when testing components that depend on external interfaces.


### Are there limitations or special considerations?
- GoogleTest expects C++17 support and an appropriate build environment.
- It is thread-safe on pthread-enabled systems; multi-threaded assertion handling varies.
- Some advanced features like death tests require attention to detail in threaded contexts.

Please review [System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-requirements/system-requirements) and [Known Limitations](primer.md#known-limitations) for details.

## Why Choose GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

GoogleTest/GoogleMock stand out for multiple reasons:

- **Comprehensive C++ Support**: Covers basic to advanced tests, including fixtures, typed, parameterized, and death tests.
- **Powerful Assertions**: Rich built-in assertions and support for custom predicates provide clear, actionable test failures.
- **Portability & Integration**: Works consistently across platforms and integrates smoothly with popular build tools like CMake and Bazel.
- **Test Isolation & Debuggability**: Each test runs independently, enabling easy fault isolation and iterative debugging.
- **Efficient Mocks**: GoogleMock supports declarative mocks with flexible expectations, allowing full control over test doubles.
- **Open Source & Industry Proven**: Backed by Google and widely adopted in the C++ community.

## Scenarios Where GoogleTest/GoogleMock Are Especially Valuable

- You need dependable, repeatable C++ tests across multiple platforms.
- Your project requires mocking complex interfaces and verifying interactions.
- You want a framework that supports a broad variety of tests without extensive setup.
- You require detailed test failure diagnostics with rich context.
- You want integration into automated CI pipelines with test filtering, sharding, and repeat.
