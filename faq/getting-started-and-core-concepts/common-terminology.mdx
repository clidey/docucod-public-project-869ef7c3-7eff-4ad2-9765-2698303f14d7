# What do common terms like 'test case', 'assertion', and 'mock' mean?

This page defines the most frequently used terms in the GoogleTest and GoogleMock ecosystems. It clarifies foundational concepts such as **test case**, **test suite**, **assertion**, **matcher**, **mock object**, and related terminology to help you better understand documentation, error messages, and testing workflows.

---

## Test Case vs Test Suite

- **Test Case** was the original term used in GoogleTest to group tests.
- **Test Suite** is the newer preferred term replacing Test Case, introduced to avoid confusion with individual test methods.
- A **test suite** groups together tests that logically belong together, often sharing common setup and teardown.

### Why the change?
GoogleTest macros like `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` actually generate a class named `TestSuiteName_TestName_Test`. This mechanism requires special rules around naming, such as avoiding underscores `_` in suite or test names to prevent collisions or reserved identifier conflicts.

**Note:** For best practices, avoid using underscores in test suite and test names.

---

## Test Fixture

A **test fixture** is a class that defines the environment for tests. It is the base for tests sharing common setup or teardown logic.

- Written as a subclass of `::testing::Test`.
- Used with the `TEST_F` macro for tests that need the fixture context.
- Allows per-test setup via constructors or `SetUp()` methods.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Set up common test resources here
  }
};

TEST_F(MyTest, DoesSomething) {
  // Test code that uses fixture environment
}
```

---

## Test

A **test** is a single unit of testing logic.

- Declared using `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros.
- Runs whatever code you write, and includes assertions to verify behaviors.
- Runs with an isolated fixture object (GoogleTest creates a fresh fixture instance for each test).

---

## Assertion

An **assertion** checks if a condition holds true during test execution and reports success or failure.

- **Fatal assertions** (e.g. `ASSERT_EQ`) abort the current test immediately upon failure.
- **Non-fatal assertions** (e.g. `EXPECT_EQ`) log failure but continue test execution.

Assertions provide messages when they fail, showing expected vs actual values.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(3, result);
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr);
```

---

## Matcher

A **matcher** is a predicate used to specify expected properties of mock function arguments or values being asserted.

- Used in GoogleMock expectations and GoogleTest assertions like `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)`.
- Can be very simple like `Eq(5)` or complex compositions like `AllOf(Ge(1), Le(5))`.
- Supports wildcards (`_`), value comparisons, and custom logic.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(Ge(10)));  // Expect Foo called with value >= 10
EXPECT_THAT(value, HasSubstring("error"));
```

---

## Mock Object and Mock Method

A **mock object** is a test double that implements a specified interface and lets you specify and verify expected interactions.

- Created by defining a mock class with `MOCK_METHOD` declarations overriding virtual methods.
- Enables setting expectations on method calls and their arguments prior to running the tested code.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, DoSomething, (int param), (override));
};

MockFoo mock_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoSomething(42))
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return(100));

int result = mock_foo.DoSomething(42);
EXPECT_EQ(result, 100);
```

---

## Expectation

An **expectation** specifies what calls you expect on a mock object.

- Created using `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(args))`.
- Can specify how many times a call should happen, in which order, and what action it performs.
- Violations cause test failures.

---

## Cardinality

**Cardinality** defines how many times a mock method call is expected.

- Examples include `Times(1)`, `AtLeast(n)`, `AnyNumber()`.
- Cardinalities can be exact counts or ranges.

---

## Parameterized Tests

Special tests where the same test logic runs with different input values or types.

- **Typed tests** use types as parameters to run the same suite for multiple implementations.
- **Value-parameterized tests** use values as parameters.

Useful for testing multiple implementations of an interface with shared expectations.

---

## Death Test

A **death test** verifies that a given statement causes the program to terminate (e.g., crash or assert).

- Runs the test statement in a subprocess to avoid killing the main test runner.
- Side effects inside the death test subprocess do not affect the parent test process.

Example macros: `EXPECT_DEATH`, `ASSERT_DEATH`.

---

## Common User Insights

- Use **test fixtures** instead of **global variables** for test state isolation.
- Avoid underscores in test suite/test names to prevent internal naming conflicts.
- Prefer using `nullptr` over `NULL` in assertions for type safety.
- Expect **fresh fixture instances** per test — fixture constructor and `SetUp()` run before each test.
- Use **mock objects** to isolate dependencies and control interaction verification.
- Always **set expectations** on mocks before the tested code makes calls.
- To disable a broken test temporarily, prefix its name with `DISABLED_`.
