# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be highly portable C++ testing and mocking frameworks. Understanding the compatibility requirements is essential to ensure successful builds and integration with your development environment. This page outlines the officially supported platforms, compilers, and the required C++ standard needed to use GoogleTest/GoogleMock effectively.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a broad set of platforms consistent with Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. The following operating systems are supported:

- **Linux**: Various distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and others.
- **Windows**: Desktop Windows versions including support for Visual Studio environments and MinGW.
- **macOS**: Supported on Mac OS X and iOS.
- **BSD Variants**: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD.
- **Other Unix-like Platforms**: Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, GNU Hurd, Fuchsia.
- **Embedded and Specialized Platforms**: Native Client, QNX, and select embedded environments such as ESP8266, ESP32, Xtensa.

While support for more common platforms such as Linux, Windows, and macOS is robust and well-tested, support for less common or older platforms may be less stable. If you encounter platform-specific issues, please consider reporting them to the community or maintainers.

<Tip>
You can refer to [Google’s foundational C++ support policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the accompanying [support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for detailed updates on platform and compiler support.
</Tip>

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports modern C++17 standards. The officially supported compilers include:

- **GCC**: Version 7.0 and later.
- **Clang/LLVM**: Version 3.4.1 and later.
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 19.11) or newer. Visual Studio 2015 offers partial support but is not recommended.
- **Intel Compiler (ICL)**: Supported if it complies with the C++17 standard.
- **Other compilers**: SunPro, IBM Visual Age, HP aCC, and others if they support C++17 or later.

These compilers must provide sufficient C++17 feature support to compile GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including features like variadic templates, constexpr, and standard library updates.

<Note>
GoogleTest rejects compilation attempts with compiler versions lacking C++17 support and instructs users to upgrade their toolchain accordingly.
</Note>

## C++ Standard Requirement

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock require **C++17 or newer** to compile and run correctly.
- Your build system should explicitly set the C++ standard version, for example in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- In environments where CMake is not used or for C projects linking with GoogleTest, the appropriate compiler flags to enforce C++17 should be provided (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang).

Failing to comply with this requirement will result in build errors.

## Platform Detection and Configuration

GoogleTest automatically detects the compilation platform using a set of predefined macros. This detection enables the framework to adjust its behavior, such as threading support and file system access.

For example, during compilation, macros like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and others are defined internally to represent the detected platform.

### Key platform macros include:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`: Compiling on any Windows Desktop or MinGW platform
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`: Linux
- `GTEST_OS_MAC`: Mac OS X
- `GTEST_OS_IOS`: iOS
- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW`: MinGW environment on Windows
- `GTEST_OS_CYGWIN`: Cygwin environment on Windows

You generally do not need to define these macros manually, as GoogleTest’s build scripts and headers take care of it. However, if your build environment fails to detect the platform correctly, it may be necessary to define or tweak these in your build flags.

## Threading and Multi-threaded Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where the pthread library is available (Linux, macOS, BSD, QNX, etc.). On Windows, proper synchronization primitives are used.

If GoogleTest does not detect pthread availability correctly in your environment, you can force threading support by setting compiler flags:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

Or to disable it:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

Using the provided CMake scripts will usually handle this correctly for you.

<Tip>
If you customize threading support, remember to link with the pthread library on POSIX platforms (for example, by linking with `-lpthread`).
</Tip>

## Building and Linking

- For build systems like CMake, GoogleTest provides integrated support with configured compiler flags and platform detection.
- On Windows with Visual Studio, GoogleTest provides `.sln` and `.vcproj` files for straightforward integration.
- For standalone builds or integration with existing projects, detailed instructions can be found in the [GoogleTest README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md).

### Visual Studio Runtime Considerations

- GoogleTest links statically against the C runtime by default. This may lead to linker errors if your project uses dynamic runtimes.
- To link GoogleTest dynamically with your project’s run-time, use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option:

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

This ensures runtime compatibility and prevents linking conflicts.

## Using GoogleTest as a Shared Library

- While most users use GoogleTest as a static library, you can opt to build it as a shared library (DLL on Windows).
- To build GoogleTest as a shared library, add `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to your compiler flags when building GoogleTest.
- When compiling your tests to use the shared library, add `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

Be aware that these flags are compiler and platform dependent and can affect linking behavior.

## Summary Table of Platform and Compiler Support

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform and Compiler Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Older Compiler">
Ensure your compiler supports C++17. Compilers older than GCC 7 or MSVC 2017 will cause build errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Issues on POSIX Platforms">
If you face linker errors related to pthread, explicitly enable pthread support by passing `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` and link with `-lpthread`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Conflicts on Windows">
If you get runtime library mismatch errors (e.g., `LNK2038`), use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align CRT linkage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Platform Not Detected Correctly">
Manually defining platform-related macros in compiler flags is rarely needed. Instead, verify your build environment and consult the platform detection logic in `gtest-port-arch.h`.
