# Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

This page provides comprehensive information about the officially supported platforms, compilers, and the required C++ standards for building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It also includes practical guidance on platform-specific flags and where to find the latest compatibility details.

---

## Supported Platforms Overview

GoogleTest is designed to offer broad cross-platform support while maintaining consistency and reliability. It adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring compatibility with actively supported compilers and platforms.

For a complete and current matrix of supported compilers, platforms, and build tools, see the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Key Supported Platforms Include:

- **Linux** (major distributions)
- **macOS** (including recent versions and Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, and related environments)
- **Selective Embedded Systems** where C++17 support is available

### Platform Variations and Notes:
- Android support is provided via Linux Android target in select environments.
- Support for less common or legacy operating systems may vary and is less tested.

## Compiler and C++ Version Requirements

### Minimum Required C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires a compiler supporting at least **C++17**. Using a C++ standard older than C++17 is not supported and will result in build errors.

You can enforce this requirement in your build system, for example in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Alternatively, C++17 compliance can be specified by adding appropriate compiler flags such as `-std=c++17`.

### Supported Compiler Versions

| Compiler           | Minimum Version        | Notes                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GCC                | 7.1 or later           | Recommended 7.1+ for full compatibility |
| Clang              | 5.0 or later           | Includes Apple Clang on macOS            |
| MSVC (Visual Studio)| VS 2015 Update 3 (v19.0.24215.1) or later | Supporting at least Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or later |

### Compiler-Specific Notes

- For MSVC, ensure you use at least Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.
- When using Visual Studio, be aware of the [runtime library linkage](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md#visual-studio-dynamic-vs-static-runtimes) and consider `gtest_force_shared_crt` to resolve runtime library mismatch errors.
- For GCC and Clang, ensure your toolchain supports C++17 features properly.

---

## Threading support

GoogleTest is thread-safe when the platform supports pthreads or equivalent threading primitives.

- If pthreads support is detected, GoogleTest will enable multi-threading.
- You can override this detection by defining `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`.
- On Windows, native threading primitives are used.

If you write multi-threaded tests, verify your platform's thread support compatibility.

---

## Platform-Specific Configuration Flags

GoogleTest uses several macros to adapt its behavior to the underlying platform and compiler environment. You can define compiler flags to override defaults or to handle platform-specific requirements.

| Macro Name                      | Purpose                                                  | Common Use Cases                       |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`            | Indicates if pthread support is present                  | Force enable/disable threading support|
| `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY`  | Used if you are building GoogleTest as a shared library  | Enable DLL export/import semantics on Windows|
| `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` | Used when building tests that link against a shared GoogleTest library | Adjust visibility and linkage flags |
| `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST`       | Prevent GoogleTest from defining the `TEST` macro to avoid name clashes | Avoid macro conflicts with other libraries|

Adjust these flags on the compiler command line to suit your build setup and platform.

## Obtaining Up-to-Date Compatibility Information

GoogleTest evolving with compiler and platform updates means support details may change. Keep the following resources bookmarked to verify compatibility regularly:

- [GoogleTest Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) — official Google policy on supported platforms and compilers.
- [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) — curated list of tested compiler versions and platforms.
- [GoogleTest README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md) — comprehensive build instructions and compiler notes.

## Practical Tips for Success

- Always specify C++17 or later in your project to avoid unsupported compiler errors.
- When building on Windows, carefully match runtime library linkage between your project and GoogleTest; consider `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option when using shared runtimes.
- Use the provided CMake integration for automatic platform and compiler flag management.
- If using custom build systems, ensure threading and export macros are appropriately configured.
- For embedded or less common platforms, verify thread and file system availability as GoogleTest requires them for certain features.

## Troubleshooting Common Platform-Related Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform and Compiler Issues">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Older Compiler or Missing C++17 Support">
Check your compiler version and ensure the build system uses flags to enforce C++17 or later. Update your compiler if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatch on Windows">
Ensure that your test project and GoogleTest libraries use consistent runtime linkage (either static or dynamic). Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake to align runtimes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Link Errors Related to Pthread on Windows with MinGW">
MinGW's pthreads implementation is not supported by GoogleTest. Use native Windows threading or compatible toolchains. The CMake scripts handle this automatically.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Executables Not Running or Crashing on Embedded Platforms">
Verify whether your target platform has necessary file system and thread support. If missing, certain GoogleTest features (like death tests) will not work.
