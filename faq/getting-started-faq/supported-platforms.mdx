# Which Platforms and Compilers are Supported?

GoogleTest is designed to be highly portable and supports a wide range of platforms, compilers, and development environments. This page clarifies exactly which operating systems and toolchains are officially supported and offers guidance on compatibility, including common questions regarding less typical or embedded setups.

---

## Official Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring that it works reliably on modern and widely used systems. Refer to [this matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for an up-to-date list of supported platforms, compilers, and build tools.

Key supported platforms include:

- **Linux** (including typical distributions and Android variants)
- **Windows** (including Desktop and MinGW environments)
- **macOS and iOS**
- Popular BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD)

In addition to these, GoogleTest has varying levels of support for other systems such as AIX, Solaris, Fuchsia, Haiku, QNX, and z/OS. These may have less stable or community-driven maintenance.

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a C++ environment supporting at least the C++17 standard.

Primary supported compilers are:

- **GCC** (support begins effectively from version 7 upwards, depending on C++17 feature support)
- **Clang** (modern Clang releases fully supported)
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later with C++17 enabled)

To successfully build GoogleTest, you must ensure your build environment selects C++17 or later standards. For example, with CMake, use:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

If your project cannot set the standard globally, pass appropriate compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

## Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest is fully thread-safe when compiled and run on systems with thread support, primarily via the pthread library on Unix-like platforms or native Windows threading APIs.

By default, GoogleTest auto-detects the availability of pthreads. If detection fails, you can explicitly control this via the compile-time macro:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # Enable pthread support
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # Disable pthread support
```

Note: When pthread support is enabled, you must add the appropriate pthread flags to your compiler and linker. For example, with gcc/clang, link with `-pthread`.

Microsoft Windows uses native threading mechanisms internally.

## Compiler Macros for Portability

GoogleTest defines a variety of macros internally to detect and adapt to environments and platform specifics:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC` and similar macros indicate platform.
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` to detect exception support.
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` to detect run-time type information (RTTI) availability.
- `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING` to check if `std::wstring` is supported.
- `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` to know if filesystem operations are allowed.

Usually, these macros do not require manual user intervention as GoogleTest automatically detects them during compilation.

## Platform Considerations and Caveats

- **Windows**:
  - GoogleTest builds with MSVC 2017 Update 3 or newer.
  - When linking with Visual Studio projects, be aware of runtime library mismatches. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to control static vs dynamic linking of the C runtime.

- **Linux/Unix**:
  - GoogleTest depends on POSIX APIs and pthread.
  - On Android, GoogleTest is supported starting with NDK API level 9 or above.

- **macOS/iOS**:
  - Supported on Mac OS X and iOS with full compatibility.

- **Embedded Platforms**:
  - Support varies; examples like ESP32 and NRF52 are supported with platform-specific integration.
  - Some embedded OSes or systems with limited standard library support may require customizing GoogleTest or disabling unsupported features.

## Building GoogleTest on Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports common build systems such as CMake and Bazel:

- Use the provided `CMakeLists.txt` and pass the proper platform-specific flags.
- Bazel rules detect platforms via constraint settings and configure build options such as linking libraries and compiler settings accordingly.

Refer to the [Quickstart with CMake](../guides/getting-started/quickstart-cmake.md) and [Quickstart with Bazel](../guides/getting-started/quickstart-bazel.md) guides for detailed build instructions tailored to various platforms.

## What If Your Platform or Compiler Is Not Officially Supported?

GoogleTest tries to be flexible, but if your platform or compiler is not in the official support matrix:

- You may try building GoogleTest manually and assess which features work or fail.
- Define or override GoogleTest control macros in your build to disable unsupported features.
- Report issues to the community or contribute patches.
- Consider submitting an email to `googletestframework@googlegroups.com` for support or collaboration.

## Troubleshooting Platform and Compiler Issues

- **Common Problem**: Build failure due to missing C++17 support.
  - Verify that your compiler supports C++17 and you set the flag properly.

- **Threading errors or race conditions**:
  - Make sure to enable pthread support where applicable.
  - Link with pthread (`-pthread` or equivalent).

- **Runtime library mismatch on Windows**:
  - Use `gtest_force_shared_crt` to match your project's settings.

- **Unsupported macros or undefined platform settings**:
  - Check that your build system defines relevant macros or upgrade your environment.

<Tip>
When building in unusual or embedded environments, carefully review `gtest-port.h` for macros you may need to define to disable unsupported features such as exceptions, RTTI, or threading.
</Tip>

## Summary

GoogleTestâ€™s extensive platform support ensures you can use it on virtually all mainstream developer environments. Its adaptability to different compilers and operating systems, combined with flexible build configurations, makes GoogleTest a robust and reliable choice for C++ testing.

If you encounter platform-specific difficulties, verify platform/compiler support, adjust feature macros, and consult the build guides for assistance.

<AccordionGroup title="In-Depth Platform Support Details and Macros">
<Accordion title="Platform Identification Macros">
GoogleTest automatically defines macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and others corresponding to your compilation platform. These enable platform-specific code paths optimized for your environment without user intervention.

These macros are always defined to 1 on the detected platform; if your environment is not detected, none may be defined.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Feature Availability Macros">
GoogleTest macros such as `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`, and `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` indicate availability of key language and library features. You can override these as needed if automatic detection is incorrect for your environment.

For example, to disable exceptions in a build that does not support them:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Version and C++ Standard Checks">
Support requires at least C++17. For example, building with MSVC requires version 19.11 or higher (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3+).

Trying to build with older standards or compilers will result in compilation errors.

You can configure your build system to specify the C++ version explicitly, for example:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Supported Build Systems and Flags">
Both CMake and Bazel systems support platform detection and appropriate build flags out-of-the-box.

Use the provided options or macros to enable features like shared libraries (`-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`), pthread support, and override default settings.
