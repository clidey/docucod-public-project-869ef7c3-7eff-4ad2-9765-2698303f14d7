# Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

GoogleTest supports a wide range of operating systems and compilers, fulfilling the needs of C++ developers aiming for portable and robust testing solutions. This page provides an overview of supported platforms, compiler requirements, C++ standard dependencies, and tips for platform-specific considerations. It also links to authoritative policies and related documentation for a comprehensive understanding.

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is validated and tested on the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (including many distributions and Android)
- **Windows** (Desktop and MinGW)
- **Mac OS X** and **iOS**
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD**
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **HP-UX**
- **QNX**
- **Fuchsia** (note: Fuchsia is not an officially supported platform)

GoogleTest defines explicit macros to detect your platform, such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC`. These are detected automatically during compilation.


## Supported Compilers and C++ Standards

- GoogleTest **requires a compiler with C++17 support or higher**. For example, recent versions of GCC (>= 7), Clang (>= 5), and MSVC (VS 2017 Update 3 and onwards) meet this requirement.

- The recommended way to specify this is via your build system, for example in CMake:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- GoogleTest supports compilers that provide standard C++17 features, including exceptions, RTTI (Run-Time Type Information), and thread support where applicable.

## Build Systems and Integration

GoogleTest provides flexible integration options:

- **CMake**: Official CMake scripts are included that generate native build files for your platform and compiler.

- **Bazel**: GoogleTest is fully buildable via Bazel with platform-specific flags.

- **Other build systems**: GoogleTest's headers and source files can be manually added to your project.

## Platform-Specific Notes

- Multi-threading support defaults to enabled on platforms with available pthread or native thread support; you can control with the macro `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`.

- On Windows with Visual Studio, you might encounter runtime library mismatches. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime linkage.

- For shared library (DLL) builds, define the macros `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building GoogleTest itself and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building your tests.

- Some embedded or mobile platforms have limited or no filesystem support, affecting features like death tests and output capturing.

- For wide-character support, GoogleTest detects platform and compiler capabilities automatically (e.g., UTF-16 on Windows).

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- Ensure your environment’s compiler supports C++17 features before integrating GoogleTest.

- Avoid mixing build configurations that use incompatible runtime libraries, especially on Windows.

- On platforms lacking native pthread support, GoogleTest synchronization primitives fall back to dummy implementations that do not guarantee thread safety.

- On platforms without full filesystem support, some advanced testing features may be unavailable.

<Check>
Ensure your compiler is set to at least C++17.
Verify platform macros in your build log if unsure of detected OS.
Match your runtime libraries especially on Windows to avoid linker errors.

## Example: Specifying C++17 in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject LANGUAGES CXX)

# Set the C++ standard to C++17 and require it.
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Include and link GoogleTest.
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```
