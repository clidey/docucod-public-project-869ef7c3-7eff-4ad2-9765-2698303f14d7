# Which platforms and toolchains are supported?

This page provides a clear overview of the currently supported compilers, platforms, and toolchains for GoogleTest. It helps you plan your development and integration environment, avoid common compatibility pitfalls, and understand the maintenance and support policy related to platform coverage.

---

## Supported Platforms Overview

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This ensures that the testing framework remains stable and compatible with the most relevant OS and compiler environments used across the industry.

For a detailed and up-to-date list of supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build tools, please refer to the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Platform Detection and Environment Support

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform it is being compiled on using internal macros. These macros inform the framework about platform-specific features and limitations to ensure compatibility. Supported platforms include mainstream systems such as Windows (with several subvariants), Linux, macOS, as well as flavors like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Android, iOS, and more specialized or embedded platforms.

### Examples of Supported Platforms Macros

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` with subcategories like:
  - `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`
  - `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW`
  - `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MOBILE`
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX` and `GTEST_OS_LINUX_ANDROID`
- `GTEST_OS_MAC` and `GTEST_OS_IOS`
- BSD variants such as `GTEST_OS_FREEBSD`, `GTEST_OS_OPENBSD`, `GTEST_OS_NETBSD`
- Others including `GTEST_OS_QNX`, `GTEST_OS_FUCHSIA`, `GTEST_OS_SOLARIS`

These platform macros govern conditional compilation and platform-specific implementation details to maintain consistent behavior.

## Compiler and Language Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires an environment with support for **C++17** or later. Ensure your compiler supports C++17, for example by setting appropriate flags such as `-std=c++17` with GCC or Clang, or enabling the equivalent in your build system.

Notably:

- The build system verifies minimum compiler versions and enforces C++17 standard compliance.
- If using CMake, set `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` to 17 and `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` to ON.

### Supported Build Systems

- GoogleTest officially supports builds through **CMake** and **Bazel**.
- Community support exists for other build systems.
- The [googletest/README.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md) and [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) provide build instructions, including handling shared libraries and multi-threaded testing.

## Toolchain and Build Flags

### Multi-threading Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where the pthread library is available. If pthread detection fails, you can manually specify this using:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

or disable it with:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
```

Using CMake typically handles this for you.

### Shared Library (DLL) Support

You can compile GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL) with:

```bash
-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

When linking tests against the shared library, use:

```bash
-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
```

This ensures runtime compatibility and future-proofing against changes in compiler behavior regarding symbol visibility.

### Runtime Library Compatibility on Windows

Visual Studio projects by default link the C runtime dynamically whereas GoogleTest statically links it. Use the CMake option:

```bash
-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

to harmonize the runtime linkage and avoid linker errors.

## Support and Maintenance Policy

GoogleTest's platform support aligns with the foundational C++ support policy defined by Google, focusing on:

- Maintaining compatibility across widely used OSes and compiler versions.
- Periodic updates to support new platforms and versions.
- Deprecation announcements well in advance for platforms falling out of support.

For the authoritative, regularly updated information on support status and platform matrices, always refer to:

- [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
- [Supported compiler/platform matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

- **Build failures due to C++ standard version:** Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or above.
- **Linker errors on Windows:** Check the runtime library linkage and use `gtest_force_shared_crt` as needed.
- **Missing pthread errors on Unix-like systems:** Explicitly enable or disable pthread support.
- **Platform-specific feature macros not detected:** Consider manually defining relevant macros following your platform's peculiarities.

Always validate your toolchain environment against the supported matrix before raising issues.
