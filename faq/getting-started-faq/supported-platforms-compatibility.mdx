# Which Platforms and Compilers Are Supported?

This page provides a clear overview of the platforms, operating systems, compilers, and C++ standards that are supported by GoogleTest. It addresses common compatibility questions and points you to additional resources to handle less typical environments or advanced configuration needs.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest is designed to be a portable and robust C++ testing framework, supporting a broad range of platforms and compilers. This compatibility enables you to write tests that run consistently across environments, including major operating systems like Linux, Windows, and Mac OS, and with modern C++ standards.

## Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest officially supports the following platforms:

- **Linux** and most Linux-based distributions
- **Windows** (including desktop versions and MinGW)
- **Mac OS X** and iOS

Additionally, support extends to many UNIX-like systems, including FreeBSD and Solaris. Platform detection is handled internally by GoogleTest using a comprehensive set of macros, enabling environment-specific optimizations and features.

> For a detailed list and the most up-to-date information, see the official [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the supported versions matrix at [Google OSS Policies Info](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).


## Supported Compilers and Minimum Versions

To build GoogleTest successfully, your environment must support:

- **C++17 standard**, which is mandatory for building and using GoogleTest.
- At minimum:
  - **GCC 7.0** or newer
  - **Clang 5.0** or newer
  - **MSVC 2017 Update 3 (19.11)** or newer

Older compiler versions typically lack key C++17 features or fail to support some required language attributes and standard library components.

### Compiler-Specific Notes

- **MSVC (Visual Studio)**:
  - GoogleTest requires at least Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (compiler version 19.11).
  - Older versions will fail with a clear error message.
  - There is support for dynamically linking to the C runtime library, which may be necessary to avoid runtime conflicts. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake flag when integrating.

- **GCC and Clang**:
  - Ensure the compiler is invoked with flags to enable C++17 (e.g., `-std=c++17`).
  - GoogleTest's CMake setup automatically enforces this.


## C++ Standard and Threading

GoogleTest mandates an environment that supports at least **C++17**.

- If your project uses CMake, specify this with:

  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- For projects using manual compiler flags or alternative build systems, ensure the C++17 standard is enabled accordingly.

- GoogleTest supports multithreading where your platform supports the pthreads library or native Windows threading.
  - You can verify threading support in your build environment by checking the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.
  - If pthread support is not automatically detected, you can force it on or off with

    ```
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
    ```

    or

    ```
    -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0
    ```

- Thread safety allows parallel test execution and safe use of multi-threaded tests. On unsupported platforms, thread-safety features are disabled.


## Handling Platform and Compiler-Specific Issues

While GoogleTest strives for seamless portability, some platforms or older compilers may require explicit tweaks:

- **Macro renaming:** If you encounter name collisions with GoogleTest macros in your codebase or other libraries, you can rename conflicting macros by defining `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_FOO` macros (e.g., `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`) to prefix GoogleTest macros, avoiding namespace pollution.

- **Building as DLL/shared library:** When using GoogleTest as a shared library on Windows, special compiler flags (`-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`) must be set.

- **Linker Errors on Windows:** Pay attention to runtime libraries mismatch, especially when mixing debug and release builds or static and dynamic CRT linkage. Use CMake's `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to harmonize linkage.

- **Embedded or Special Platforms:** Platforms like Android or specific embedded boards have workarounds or limited feature sets. Consult the Foundational C++ Support Policy for detailed notes.

- **Custom Platform Support:** GoogleTest provides customization points, such as in `gtest-port.h` and `gmock-port.h`, where advanced users can adapt platform-specific behavior.


## Where to Find More Detailed and Updated Support Information

GoogleTest’s compatibility matrix and platform policies are maintained externally and updated regularly. Refer to these resources for the latest:

Additionally, the **googletest/docs/platforms.md** document in the source code repository provides further context about the supported platforms and related details.


## Summary

| Aspect                          | Details                          |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Supported OS                   | Linux, Windows, Mac, UNIX-like  |
| Minimum Compiler Versions      | GCC ≥ 7.0, Clang ≥ 5.0, MSVC 2017 Update 3 |
| Required C++ Standard          | C++17                           |
| Threading Support              | POSIX pthreads or Windows threads |
| Customization                 | Available via build macros and config headers |


## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you experience build or runtime issues related to platform or compiler compatibility:

1. **Check your compiler version and flags** — Ensure C++17 support and minimum version compliance.
2. **Review CMake or build configuration** — Verify that options like `gtest_force_shared_crt` and pthread flags are properly set.
3. **Consider environment overrides** — Define macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` or rename macro conflicts as needed.
4. **Consult the logs/errors** — GoogleTest produces clear errors for unsupported compilers or configurations (e.g., MSVC < 2015).
5. **Use the official support matrix** — Confirm your platform and compiler against the supported versions.

## Example: Ensuring Compatibility in Your CMake Project

Here is a minimal snippet to add GoogleTest with proper world-wide platform support via CMake:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/5376968f6948923e2411081fd9372e71a59d8e77.zip
)
# Force dynamic CRT on Windows to prevent runtime conflicts.
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp other_tests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)

set_target_properties(my_tests PROPERTIES
  CXX_STANDARD 17
  CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON
)

add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

This setup enforces C++17 and smooth cross-platform builder behavior.
