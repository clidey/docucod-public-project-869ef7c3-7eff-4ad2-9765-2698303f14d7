# Supported Platforms and Compatibility

This page clarifies the platforms, compilers, and C++ standard versions supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock, and provides guidance to handle common compatibility concerns encountered when using these frameworks across diverse environments.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to support a broad spectrum of operating systems, following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Supported Platforms Include:

- Linux
- Windows (including MinGW and Windows Desktop variants)
- macOS and iOS
- BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
- Various other Unix-like systems: Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.
- Embedded platforms such as ESP32, ESP8266, and others with conditional support

Support is strongest for mainstream desktop and server platforms. Other platforms may be usable but with less rigorous testing.

> Note: On Windows, MinGW is supported but its pthreads implementation is avoided due to conformance issues.

## 2. Compiler Requirements and Compatibility

### Minimum Compiler Versions

- **MS Visual C++ 2015 or newer** (Visual Studio 14.0+) is required for GoogleMock and GoogleTest compilation. Older MSVC versions will fail with a compilation error.

- Other major compilers like GCC, Clang, Intel LLVM, SunPro, IBM XL, and HP aCC are supported with varying degrees of flag customization handled by the build system.

### C++ Standard

- GoogleTest requires **C++17 or newer** to build and function correctly.
  
  - Ensure your compiler is configured to use C++17 with flags such as `-std=c++17` or the CMake directive `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` with `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)`.

  - If your project cannot set C++17 globally (e.g., a C project using GoogleTest), specify the flag manually on your build system.

### Feature Detection and Overrides

GoogleTest attempts automatic detection of key features (exceptions, RTTI, pthread support). However, you can manually override these via compiler definitions:

- `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` â€” forces enabling or disabling pthread support.

- Other macros starting with `GTEST_HAS_` allow fine control of feature usage.

## 3. Threading and Concurrency Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe where pthread libraries are available.

- On Windows, GoogleTest uses native synchronization primitives.

- Platforms without pthread support or thread facilities get a no-op stub implementation resulting in non-thread-safe GoogleTest.

- You can check thread safety status programmatically via the macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.

> Tip: On systems where pthread is present but not auto-detected, manually define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.

## 4. Build System Integration and Platform Tweaks

### CMake Support

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock include CMake build scripts capable of generating platform-native makefiles or project files.

- The CMake configuration automatically detects platform features such as pthread availability and sets compiler/linker flags accordingly.

- For Windows/MSVC, CMake attempts to synchronize CRT linkage behavior between GoogleTest and your project with options like `gtest_force_shared_crt`.

- Advanced users may define or disable shared/static library builds using standard CMake flags such as `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`.

### Compiler Flags and Optional Macros

- To resolve common platform build issues (especially on MSVC), GoogleTest uses strict warning levels and attempts to suppress warnings that conflict with standard C++ testing code.

- Renaming macros to avoid conflicts with other libraries is possible by defining macros like `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`.

- Build options defined within CMake or custom build scripts allow toggling between features and adapting GoogleTest/GoogleMock to unique build environments.

## 5. Known Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Windows Mobile and Embedded Variants:** Certain features like file system access and stream redirection are disabled or unavailable.

- **Embedded Systems (ESP32, ESP8266, Xtensa):** Limited or stubbed functionality is in place, given hardware and OS constraints.

- **Android:** GoogleTest supports Android with considerations for API level compatibility, especially regarding POSIX features and clone support.

- **MinGW on Windows:** Although MinGW supports pthreads, GoogleTest prefers native Windows threading due to POSIX conformance issues.

- **Macro expansions and function replacements:** Special considerations, such as using `_snprintf_s` on MSVC instead of `snprintf`, are applied.

## 6. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

### Common Build Failures

- **MSVC version errors:** If you see errors related to MSVC version validation, ensure you use Visual Studio 2015 or later.

- **C++ standard errors:** GoogleTest requires C++17 or greater. Confirm compiler flags and CMake settings to enforce this.

- **Threading problems:** Link errors related to pthread can often be resolved by explicitly setting `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` and linking pthread libraries.

- **Runtime library conflicts on Windows:** If encountering link errors around the runtime library type (MT vs MD), enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake or synchronize your build's runtime library settings.

### Best Practices

- Prefer building GoogleTest and your project with the same compiler and standard library settings to avoid incompatibilities.

- When integrating GoogleTest as a submodule or via fetch-content in CMake, rely on GoogleTest's build configuration to keep flags coherent.

- On platforms with limited support, consider disabling features with compiler defines or using stub implementations included in GoogleTest.
