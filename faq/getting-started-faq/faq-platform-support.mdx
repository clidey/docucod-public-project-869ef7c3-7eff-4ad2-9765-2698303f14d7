# Platform and Toolchain Compatibility FAQ

This page addresses common questions about which operating systems, compilers, and build tools GoogleTest supports. It provides guidance on handling environment differences and maintaining compatibility as the framework evolves.

---

## 1. Which operating systems does GoogleTest support?

GoogleTest supports a broad range of major operating systems, fulfilling Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. These include:

- Linux (most modern distributions)
- Windows (including recent Visual Studio toolchains)
- macOS

Support covers both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures where applicable.

<Info>
Ensure you meet platform prerequisites such as proper compiler and threading support detailed in the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/setup-overview/prerequisites-and-requirements.md).
</Info>

---

## 2. Which compilers and compiler versions are supported?

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler to build and run successfully. Supported compilers include:

- GCC (with adequate C++17 support, typically 7.0 and above)
- Clang (compatible versions supporting C++17)
- Microsoft Visual C++ (Visual Studio 2017 and newer)

<Note>
Check your compiler documentation regarding standards compliance. GoogleTest enforces C++17 minimum to leverage modern language features consistently.
</Note>

---

## 3. What build tools and systems are compatible with GoogleTest?

GoogleTest provides seamless integration with popular C++ build systems:

- **CMake:** Officially supported with a flexible `CMakeLists.txt` setup. You can build GoogleTest standalone or embed it as part of your project using `add_subdirectory()` or `FetchContent`.

- **Bazel:** GoogleTest supports Bazel with ready-to-use build rules.

Additional build tools that interact with these systems or support CMake/Bazel integration typically work well.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Build System Integration Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/guides/integration-and-patterns/build-system-integration.md) for practical instructions and troubleshooting.
</Tip>

---

## 4. How do I manage environment differences across platforms?

Platform-specific differences—such as file system conventions, path separators, or threading primitives—are internally abstracted by GoogleTest's portability layer. However, to ensure smooth cross-platform compatibility:

- Use GoogleTest macros and APIs rather than platform-specific calls.
- Rely on the portability layer macros (found in `gtest-port.h`) to detect feature availability.
- Define platform-specific preprocessor directives if custom extensions or environment tweaks are necessary.

<Check>
Consult the [Portability Layer](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/api-reference/platform-and-internals/portability-layer.md) documentation for how GoogleTest adapts to different platforms.
</Check>

---

## 5. Does GoogleTest’s supported platform list change over time?

Yes. GoogleTest evolves in alignment with the underlying compiler and platform ecosystem. Planned changes include:

- Enforcing newer C++ standard requirements (currently C++17 minimum).
- Integration of Abseil as a dependency to improve modularity and feature sets.
- Deprecation of support for legacy platforms or compilers no longer meeting Google’s Foundational C++ Support standards.

<Warning>
Review the [Upcoming Roadmap](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/changelog/deprecations-roadmap/roadmap-upcoming.md) and [Deprecation Notices](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/changelog/deprecations-roadmap/deprecation-notices.md) regularly to prepare for upgrades and maintain compatibility.
</Warning>

---

## 6. What are the common pitfalls when building GoogleTest on various platforms?

- **Missing C++17 support:** Attempting to build GoogleTest with an older compiler or incorrect compiler flags can fail silently or cause confusing errors.
- **Threading support:** On POSIX systems, the pthread library must be available and properly linked.
- **Runtime library conflicts (Windows):** Mixing static and dynamic CRT runtimes can lead to linker issues; use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to resolve.
- **Macro name collisions:** GoogleTest macros can clash with other libraries. Use the `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO>` flags to rename GoogleTest macros if needed.

<Tip>
Refer to the detailed common issues and their solutions in the [Installation and Configuration FAQs](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-validation/common-issues.md).
</Tip>

---

## 7. How can I verify that my development environment is correctly set up?

1. Build and install GoogleTest according to the instructions in the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/setup-overview/installation.md).
2. Compile and run the minimal sample test executable as described in the [Quick Validation Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/getting-started/troubleshooting-and-validation/quick-validation.md).
3. Address any compilation, linking, or runtime errors during this process before proceeding to more complex test setups.

<Check>
Successful running of sample tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` returning zero indicates a correctly configured environment.
</Check>

---

## 8. How to keep GoogleTest builds compatible with evolving platform and toolchain requirements?

- Regularly monitor GoogleTest's release notes, changelogs, and migration guides to catch any breaking changes early.
- Use the prescribed C++ standard in your build (C++17 minimum) and update compiler versions when GoogleTest raises deprecation warnings.
- Review deprecation notices and roadmap documents months ahead to schedule upgrades.
- Isolate GoogleTest integration within your build system to simplify updates.

<Info>
The [Migration and Upgrade Guides](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/changelog/migrations-breaking-changes/migration-guides.md) provide explicit instructions for handling changes between GoogleTest versions.
</Info>

---

## 9. How can I handle compiler-specific warnings or errors related to mocking?

- Ensure that any mocked class has virtual destructors; lacking these causes undefined behavior and memory issues.
- Remove top-level `const` qualifiers on parameters, particularly when using MSVC, to avoid spurious warnings.
- When dealing with overloaded or templated mock methods, follow gMock’s recommended syntax using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro, including all necessary qualifier specifiers.

<Note>
Consult the [Mocking FAQ](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/gmock_faq.md) for known compiler quirks and detailed resolutions.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Platform and Toolchain Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on POSIX Systems">
These are often caused by missing pthread linkage. Make sure to link with `-lpthread`.

If using CMake, the GoogleTest CMake script usually manages pthread linkage automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Runtime Library Mismatches on Windows">
Linker errors about differing runtime libraries are resolved by setting the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to ON, which aligns runtime linkage between your project and GoogleTest.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compiler Warnings About Const Parameters in Mocks">
Top-level `const` qualifiers on mock method parameters are ignored by compilers and can trigger warnings, especially on MSVC. The solution is to remove `const` from value parameters in both interface and mock class declarations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unrecognized C++17 Features by Compiler">
Ensure your compiler version truly supports C++17. Upgrade to a newer compiler if necessary and specify `-std=c++17` (or equivalent) in your build flags.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build Fails due to Macro Collisions">
If GoogleTest macros clash with those of other libraries, use the `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO>` macro definitions to rename GoogleTest macros with a `GTEST_` prefix.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build System Can't Find GoogleTest Headers">
Verify include paths and library linkages. If embedded as a subdirectory, check your `add_subdirectory` and target link dependencies.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
