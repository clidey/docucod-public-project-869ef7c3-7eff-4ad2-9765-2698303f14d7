# Which platforms and C++ standards are supported?

This page clarifies the platforms, compiler versions, and C++ language standards supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It helps you confirm your environment's compatibility early in your setup process and avoid common pitfalls linked to unsupported configurations.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) which defines supported compiler versions, platforms, and build tools. For the latest detailed compatibility matrix, refer to this [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

Currently, GoogleTest supports a wide range of desktop, server, and embedded platforms, including:

- **Linux** (including Android variants)
- **Windows** (desktop, MinGW, Windows Phone, Windows RT)
- **macOS** and **iOS**
- **BSD variants**
- Other Unix-like systems such as Solaris, AIX, and embedded OSes with relevant toolchains

The platform detection and compatibility are maintained automatically through predefined macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and others documented internally, ensuring broad coverage across modern environments.

## Compiler Support and Minimum C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports at least **C++17**. This is a strict minimum requirement and applies to all supported compilers.

### Supported Compilers

- **GCC** version 7.0 and higher
- **Clang** versions with C++17 support (varies, commonly 5.0+)
- **MSVC** version 19.11 (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3) and higher
- **Intel C++ Compiler** compatible with C++17
- **Other compilers** supporting C++17 compliant features

GoogleTest uses compiler feature testing macros and internal assertions to enforce the minimum C++ language version at compile time. For example, if your compiler does not support C++17, you will encounter errors such as:

```
#error C++ versions less than C++17 are not supported.
```

### Specifying the C++ Standard

When building GoogleTest, it is important to indicate the required C++ standard in your build system to guarantee compatibility. For CMake users, this can be done by adding:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

This ensures the compiler enforces at least C++17 features are available for GoogleTest's internals and user tests.

> If you cannot specify this in the main project (e.g., when embedding tests into a C project), you can provide the standard via compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` or equivalent.

## Platform and Feature Detection

GoogleTest and GoogleMock internally use a comprehensive set of feature and platform detection macros defined primarily in `gtest-port.h` and `gtest-port-arch.h`. These handle:

- Operating system detection with macros like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC`.
- Compiler capabilities such as exception support, RTTI, threading availability (pthreads, Windows threading), etc.
- Availability of POSIX APIs and regex implementations.

This wide-ranging detection ensures that GoogleTest can conditionally enable or disable functionality to suit various environments while alerting you when your setup lacks key compatibility.

## Embedded and Limited Environment Support

While GoogleTest focuses on desktop and server platforms, it can be configured for embedded environments with care:

- Some embedded platforms lack full C++17 support, pthreads, or filesystem APIs.
- GoogleTest defines macros to disable or substitute unsupported features.
- You may need to customize build flags or provide adaptations via the customization points.

Review the [Prerequisites and Supported Platforms](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/setup-overview/prerequisites) page for detailed guidance on embedded or less-common platforms.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Build failures due to unsupported C++ versions**: Make sure your compiler and build system are set to use C++17 or later.
- **Linker errors on Windows due to runtime mismatches**: Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtimes.
- **Thread support problems**: Verify thread libraries (pthread or Windows threads) are available as GoogleTest requires them for thread safety.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting) guide for more detailed solutions.

## Practical Tips

- Always verify your compiler's version and ensure it supports at least C++17 before beginning your tests.
- When configuring your build environment, explicitly set the C++ standard to 17 or higher.
- If encountering platform-specific runtime or threading issues, check for appropriate macros such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` or `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY`.
- Consult the GoogleTest source headers like `gtest-port.h` for insight into platform-specific behavior and flags.

By confirming these platform and language requirements before starting, you ensure a smooth, robust experience using GoogleTest and GoogleMock for your C++ projects.
