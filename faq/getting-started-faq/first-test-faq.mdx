# Frequently Asked Questions: Writing and Running Your First Test

This FAQ answers the most common questions new users have when creating and executing their first tests using GoogleTest, focusing on structuring test files, writing assertions, and understanding test outputs.

---

## 1. How do I structure a simple test file?

Start with including GoogleTest headers and write tests using the `TEST()` macro, which defines individual tests within test suites.

Example:
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple test suite named FactorialTest with one test HandlesZeroInput
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

- The first argument to `TEST()` is the test suite name.
- The second argument is the test name.
- Both names must be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.

Tests are grouped logically by test suite for easier organization and reporting.

---

## 2. What are assertions and how do I use them?

Assertions check conditions and determine test success or failure. Two types exist:

- `EXPECT_*`: Reports failure but continues the test.
- `ASSERT_*`: Reports failure and aborts the current test function.

Use `EXPECT_*` when you want to continue testing even after failures, and `ASSERT_*` when a failure means the rest of the test cannot proceed safely.

Example:
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer should not be null";
EXPECT_EQ(value, expected_value) << "Values differ at index 0";
```

You can stream additional messages for clarity.

---

## 3. How do I share setup for multiple tests?

Use Test Fixtures via `TEST_F()`. Define a fixture class inheriting from `testing::Test`, set up shared resources in the constructor or `SetUp()`, then write tests using `TEST_F()` to access those resources.

Example:
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  Queue<int> q_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsNotEmpty) {
  EXPECT_NE(q_.size(), 0);
}
```

Each test gets a fresh fixture instance, ensuring isolation.

---

## 4. How do I actually run the tests?

Use the macro `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your main function after initializing GoogleTest with `InitGoogleTest()`.

Example main():
```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This will discover and run all tests defined in your program, reporting pass/fail results.

TIP: In most cases, you can link with `gtest_main` to avoid writing `main()` yourself.

---

## 5. How do I interpret common test output results?

- **PASSED:** All assertions succeeded in a test.
- **FAILED:** One or more assertions failed or the test crashed.
- Failure messages include the source file and line number, plus any custom messages.
- Summary groups tests by suite, showing numbers of passed, failed, and skipped tests.

Example failure snippet:
```
path/to/test.cc:25: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  result
    Which is: 5
  expected
    Which is: 10
```

You can jump to reported source lines to debug.

---

## 6. Can I write tests for functions that rely on common setup or shared data?

Yes, use fixtures (`TEST_F()`) to handle complex setup and teardown uniformly across related tests.

---

## 7. What if I want to skip a test or mark it as not applicable?

Use `GTEST_SKIP();` inside a test or fixture setup to skip the test at runtime, optionally with a message.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, TestSkipped) {
  GTEST_SKIP() << "Not implemented yet.";
  // Test code that won't run.
}
```

---

## 8. How do I deal with naming conventions for tests?

- Use PascalCase or CamelCase without underscores.
- Test suite names should reflect the class or feature tested.
- Test names should concisely describe the specific behavior under test.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MathUtilsTest, CorrectlyComputesFactorial);
```

---

## 9. How do I debug failing tests?

- Examine failure messages: file, line number, expected vs actual values.
- Re-run specific tests using filters like `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName`.
- Use verbose modes if supported.
- Write smaller, focused tests to isolate problems.

---

## 10. What are the next steps after my first test?

- Explore `TEST_F()` with fixtures for reusable setups.
- Learn about assertions in more detail via the [Assertions Reference](../../api-reference/core-testing-apis/assertions).
- Review guides on [Writing Powerful Assertions](../../guides/core-workflows/writing-assertions).
- Start using parameterized and typed tests for data-driven testing.
