# What are the most important features and limitations?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock compose a powerful testing and mocking framework tailored for C++ developers. This page provides a focused overview on the core capabilities of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, highlighting how they discover tests, assert conditions, parameterize tests, and interact to provide rich mocking facilities. Additionally, it outlines notable limitations users should be aware of to successfully utilize the framework in real-world scenarios.

## Core Capabilities Overview

### GoogleTest - Test Discovery and Assertions

GoogleTest is designed to automatically discover and run test cases within your test binaries. It provides robust assertion macros and matchers to verify program correctness.

- **Automatic Test Discovery:** GoogleTest automatically registers test cases and tests through macros, eliminating manual test registration. Executing `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` runs all tests discovered.
- **Assertion Macros:** Includes a rich set of assertion macros (`EXPECT_`, `ASSERT_`) covering predicates, equality, exceptions, and more.
- **Matchers:** Extensible argument validation with built-in matchers and support for user-defined matchers improves test expressivity.
- **Parameterized and Typed Tests:** Enables writing tests once and running them over multiple data sets or type parameters to maximize coverage and code reuse.

_For detailed usage, see [Test Discovery & Execution](../api-reference/gtest-core-apis/test-discovery-execution) and [Assertions and Test Macros](../api-reference/gtest-core-apis/test-assertions)._

### GoogleMock - Extensible Mocking Framework

GoogleMock offers a complete framework for creating mock classes and setting expectations precisely, enabling interaction-based testing and improved test isolation.

- **Mock Class Definition:** Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to declare mock methods in your mock classes, supporting various qualifiers (`const`, `override`, `noexcept`, calltypes, and reference qualifiers).
- **Setting Expectations:** Define behavioral expectations and invocations on your mock methods via `EXPECT_CALL`, specifying argument matchers, cardinalities (`Times`), and call order (`InSequence`, `After`).
- **Default Behavior Specification:** `ON_CALL` allows setting default behaviors without imposing call expectations.
- **Modifiers and Clauses:** Chainable clauses like `With`, `Times`, `WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`, and `RetiresOnSaturation` precisely control mock behaviors and lifetime.
- **Advanced Features:** Support for mocking overloaded methods, const methods, mock class templates, delegation to fakes or real instances, and mocking non-virtual methods with template techniques.
- **Strictness Levels:** `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` let you control warnings or errors on uninteresting calls, aiding test maintenance and debugging.

## Important Features to Highlight

### MOCK_METHOD Macro

This macro declares a mock method in a mock class, mirroring the signature of the target virtual method. Correct usage must place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public:` section regardless of original access levels (public, protected, or private).

**Handling Commas in Types:** When return or argument types contain commas (e.g., template types), wrap them in parentheses or use type aliases to avoid parsing errors.

Example:
```cpp
class MyMock {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool));
};
```

### EXPECT_CALL for Setting Expectations

Declare expected mock function calls, argument matchers, cardinalities (`Times`), and behaviors (`WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`). The order of chaining clauses matters and enforces call semantics.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, MethodName(Args...))
    .Times(Exactly(3))
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(0));
```

### ON_CALL for Default Actions

Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors on mocks without mandating call expectations.

Example:
```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_object, MethodName(_)).WillByDefault(Return(true));
```

This设置行为为默认若不特别指定匹配的`EXPECT_CALL`

### Call Ordering and Partial Ordering

Use `InSequence` and `Sequence` to enforce call order constraints on mock calls, either fully ordered or partially ordered via DAGs expressed with `After` and `InSequence` clauses.

---

## Limitations and Common Pitfalls

### Virtuality Requirement

Only virtual methods can be mocked directly using `MOCK_METHOD`. Non-virtual methods require alternative techniques such as template-based non-virtual mocking or interface wrapping.

### Variadic Functions

gMock does not support mocking variadic functions (those with ellipsis `...` arguments). Consider interface redesign via overloading to circumvent this.

### Overly Strict Expectations

Over-specifying expectations (such as exact call orders or argument values unnecessarily) may lead to brittle tests that break with refactoring. Use `ON_CALL` for defaults and `EXPECT_CALL` only where behavior verification is critical.

### Mock Method Declaration Access

`MOCK_METHOD` declarations must always be in the `public:` section of the mock class even if the original base method is protected or private.

### Comma Handling in Templates

If argument or return types contain commas, wrap them with extra parentheses or use type aliases to avoid macro parsing errors.

### Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks Caveats

`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` only affect mock methods declared with `MOCK_METHOD` directly in the mock class, not those inherited from base classes. Also, nested strictness wrappers are unsupported.

### Mock Object Lifecycle and Verification

Verification happens when the mock object is destructed. Heap-allocated mocks not properly deleted may lead to skipped verification. Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to force verification when needed.

### Move-only Types

Supporting move-only argument and return types is robust but has some limitations in built-in actions; custom lambdas or actions may be required in complex scenarios.

## Best Practices

- Favor `ON_CALL` for setting common default behaviors and use `EXPECT_CALL` to enforce critical interaction constraints.
- Use argument matchers such as `_` to avoid over-specifying argument expectations.
- When ordering matters, use `InSequence` or `After` to describe the intended partial or total order explicitly.
- Leverage `RetiresOnSaturation()` to ensure expectations automatically retire after being saturated, preventing sticky expectations from causing unexpected failures.
- Use `NiceMock` in tests where uninteresting calls are expected and should not emit warnings.
- Use `StrictMock` cautiously to catch all unexpected interactions, but be carefully aware it can make tests brittle.
- For mocking methods with template or complex signatures, use type aliases or parentheses to avoid parsing problems.
- Always declare mock methods in `public:` regardless of base class access.

## Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a comprehensive, flexible foundation for C++ testing and mocking. With automatic test discovery, expressive assertions, rich mock expectations, and behavior modifiers, they empower developers to build robust tests that verify both state and behavior.

Awareness of virtual method requirements, mock method declaration rules, order specifications, and mock lifecycle management ensures smooth adoption and maintainability. Leveraging best practices balances test rigor with resilience.

Harnessing these core features effectively accelerates productive C++ development and boosts confidence in code correctness.
