# How should I organize my tests for maintainability?

Explore best practices for structuring your test code, naming conventions, and managing complex test suites to keep your test base scalable and readable as your project grows.

---

## 1. Group Related Tests into Test Suites

Organize your tests by grouping logically related tests into **test suites**. Use test suite names that clearly reflect the component or feature under test.

- **Why?:**
  - Keeps tests manageable as your project grows.
  - Makes it easier to locate tests related to a specific functionality.

- **How:**
  - Use the `TEST()` macro with a descriptive test suite name.
  - Avoid underscores (`_`) in suite names as per naming convention.
  - Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathFunctions, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(MathFunctions, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```


## 2. Use Test Fixtures (`TEST_F`) for Shared Setup and Teardown

If multiple tests share common set-up or tear-down logic (like creating objects, initializing data), **use test fixtures**.

- **Benefits:**
  - Avoids code duplication.
  - Clarifies test intent by centralizing common preparation.

- **How:**
  1. Derive a class from `testing::Test`.
  2. Declare shared objects and override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` if needed.
  3. Write tests using `TEST_F()` with the fixture class name.

- **Example:**

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db_.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db_.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db_;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertsDataCorrectly) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_.Insert("key", "value"));
}
```


## 3. Employ Parameterized Tests for Repetitive Test Logic

When the same test logic applies to multiple input values or configurations, **value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`)** or **typed tests (`TYPED_TEST`)** are your tools.

- **Why:**
  - Avoids repetitive test code.
  - Ensures consistent behavior across different inputs or types.

- **How:**
  - Derive your fixture from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`.
  - Write parameterized tests with `TEST_P`.
  - Instantiate them with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` using parameter generators like `Values`, `Range`.

- **Example:**

```cpp
class MyTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```


## 4. Apply Clear and Consistent Naming Conventions

Names communicate intent. Follow consistent naming for test suites, fixtures, and test cases:

- **Avoid underscores:** GoogleTest recommends names without underscores for test suites and tests.
- **Keep names descriptive yet succinct:** For example, `StringUtils` instead of `StrUtils`.
- **Reflect behavior or scenario in test names:** e.g., `HandlesEmptyInput` or `FailsOnInvalidFormat`.

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(StringUtils, HandlesEmptyInput) { ... }
TEST(StringUtils, ConvertsToUpperCase) { ... }
```


## 5. Keep Tests Independent and Atomic

Each test should focus on a single behavior or functionality:

- Avoid dependencies between tests.
- Ensure tests can run in any order without side effects.
- Independent tests simplify diagnosing failures.


## 6. Manage Complex Test Suites with Per-Suite Setup

For expensive resources shared across all tests in a suite, use **per-suite set-up and tear-down**:

- Define `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` in your test fixture class.
- Use them to initialize and release expensive shared resources.

**Example:**

```cpp
class ExpensiveResourceTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete resource_;
    resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static ExpensiveResource* resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* ExpensiveResourceTest::resource_ = nullptr;
```


## 7. Use Fixtures and Suites to Share Test Context

- Avoid global variables for shared data.
- Store shared test data in fixtures.
- Each test runs with a new instance of the fixture class, ensuring isolation.

## 8. Keep Test Files Focused and Organized

- Place tests for related components in dedicated files.
- Consider mirroring your source code directory structure for tests.
- Facilitate easy navigation and maintenance.


## 9. Handle Disabled and Skipped Tests Carefully

- Temporarily disable broken tests using `DISABLED_` prefix.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests at runtime when preconditions are not met.
- Periodically review disabled tests to avoid test rot.


## 10. Best Practices Summary

- Group related tests logically in suites; use descriptive names.
- Use fixtures (`TEST_F`) for shared set-up and tear-down.
- Employ parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) for reusable test logic over multiple inputs.
- Write independent, atomic tests for reliability and easier debugging.
- Maintain clean code structure in test files mirroring the source code.
- Avoid over-constraining mocks (reference mocking best practices).

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### Q: Why are my tests flaky or order-dependent?
- Tests likely share state or depend on side effects.
- Make sure tests **do not rely on execution order**.
- Use fixtures to reset state properly in `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.

### Q: How do I deal with expensive setup slowing down tests?
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to create shared expensive resources only once per suite.
- Keep tests fast and focused.

### Q: How can I enforce order on mock expectations?
- Use `Sequence` and `InSequence` constructs from the mocking API to enforce call order.
- Avoid brittle tests by limiting ordering constraints to where needed.

# Example Test Organization Workflow

```plaintext
Project Source   ───────────────────────────────  Tests
  ├── utils                                ├── utils_test.cc
  │       Foo.cpp, Bar.cpp                    FooTest
  │                                              - HandlesEdgeCases
  │                                              - ReturnsExpectedValue
  ├── network                              ├── network_test.cc
  │       client.cpp, server.cpp               ClientTest
  │                                              - SuccessfulConnection
  │                                              - ConnectionTimeout
  │                                         ServerTest
  │                                              - ListensOnPort
  │                                              - HandlesMultipleClients
```

This approach helps new team members to find relevant tests easily and promotes maintainability.

# Final Note

Organizing your tests isn't just about code; it's about usability and sustainability. A well-organized test suite lets you build confidence with every change, ensures your tests grow with your project, and makes debugging smoother and faster.

Approach test organization with the same discipline and clarity as you do for your production code — it pays off in long-term productivity.
