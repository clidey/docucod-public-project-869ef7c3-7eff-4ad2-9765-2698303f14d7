# Understanding Test Discovery

GoogleTest simplifies your testing workflow by automatically discovering and running test cases, removing the need to manually list or invoke tests. This page explains how GoogleTest identifies which tests to run, clarifies common misconceptions about test detection, and helps resolve issues when tests don't appear to be picked up.

## How Test Discovery Works in GoogleTest

### Automatic Registration of Tests

When you write tests using macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, GoogleTest registers these tests automatically at program startup. This means:

- You do **not** need to list your tests explicitly anywhere.
- Once linked into your test program, all tests defined are known to the framework.

### Running Tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

GoogleTest runs all registered tests when you call the macro `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. This function:

- Iterates over all registered tests.
- Runs them sequentially, creating and tearing down fixtures as needed.
- Returns 0 if all tests pass or a non-zero value if any fail.

### Initialization with `InitGoogleTest()`

Before running tests, you must call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` to:

- Parse GoogleTest-specific command-line flags.
- Initialize internal data structures.

Neglecting to call this function or improper argument passing can lead to tests not being discovered or run.

### Example of a Typical Main Function

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This simple pattern ensures all test cases defined in the linked source files are executed.

## Common Confusions About Test Discovery

### 1. Why aren’t my tests running?

- **Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called.** This macro triggers test execution.
- **Verify `InitGoogleTest()` is invoked before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.** Otherwise, tests may not initialize properly.
- **Confirm your test source files are linked.** If the linker excludes a test file, its tests won’t be registered.

### 2. Do I need to register tests manually?

No. GoogleTest registers all tests automatically behind the scenes. Simply defining tests using `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros is enough.

### 3. What happens if I define multiple `main()` functions?

It is critical to have exactly one `main()` function handling test initialization and execution. GoogleTest provides `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries that define a suitable `main()` — link against one of these to avoid writing your own unless customization is necessary.

### 4. How does GoogleMock integrate with test discovery?

GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest’s test registration mechanism. When linking with `gmock_main`, GoogleMock’s provided `main()` calls `testing::InitGoogleMock()`, which also initializes GoogleTest and runs all tests seamlessly.

## Practical Tips for Successful Test Discovery

### Link Test Files Correctly

Make sure all your test files compiling tests are included during linking into your test executable. Missing Compile/Link steps cause tests to vanish.

### Use Provided Main Functions When Possible

Link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries to get a reliable main function that initializes and runs tests. Only write your own main if you must customize initialization.

### Verify Your Build Configuration

- Confirm your build system includes the GoogleTest source and headers.
- On platforms like Windows, ensure no CRT (C runtime) linkage conflicts prevent linking successfully.

### Command-line Flags Aid Discovery and Filtering

- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to list all discovered tests without running them.
- Use `--gtest_filter` to select a subset of tests to run.

Example:

```bash
your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests

your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*
```

### Watch for Static Initialization Order Issues

GoogleTest relies on static initialization of test registration objects. If you use complex build setups, ensure static objects are initialized properly by linking accordingly.

## Troubleshooting: When Tests Are Not Found or Not Running

### Symptoms

- Your test program runs but prints "No tests to run."
- Specific tests you wrote are not executed or shown in the list.
- Linking errors or missing symbols related to GoogleTest internals.

### Systematic Checks and Solutions

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Test Definition and Placement">
Make sure your test code uses the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.

- Tests must be in global scope or inside namespaces, not inside functions.
- Confirm tests are not conditionally compiled away.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Build and Link Process">
Ensure all test source files are compiled and linked into your test executable.

- On CMake: Verify target sources include test files.
- On Bazel or other build systems: Confirm dependencies are correct.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Initialization Functions Are Called">
Your test program must call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- For GoogleMock, use `testing::InitGoogleMock()`, which initializes GoogleTest too.
- Avoid multiple conflicting main() implementations.
</Step>

<Step title="Use GoogleTest Flags for Diagnostics">
Run your test executable with `--gtest_list_tests` to see detected tests.

- If no tests are listed, the problem is with registration or linking.
- If tests are listed but not running, check command-line filters.
</Step>

<Step title="Check for Static Linking or Visibility Issues">
Static registries sometimes are eliminated by linker optimizations.

- Add explicit references or link flags to prevent dead code elimination.
- Check platform-specific quirks affecting static initialization order.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Custom Main or Initialization Code">
If you wrote your own main or custom initialization, verify it calls the correct initialization routines.

- Avoid calling `InitGoogleTest()` and `InitGoogleMock()` redundantly or incorrectly.
- If using Arduino/embedded platforms, confirm supported main variants.
</Step>

<Step title="Inspect Output and Logs Carefully">
Look for messages like:

- "[==========] No tests found."
- Warnings about uninteresting call or missing expectations (for mocks).

These clues often hint toward misconfiguration or missing registration.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Common Pitfall: Missing Tests Due to Linker Exclusion

If an object file or static library containing tests has no externally referenced symbols, some linkers discard them as unused, causing tests not to register.

**Solution:** Use linker flags to retain all related symbols or add dummy references.

## How GoogleTest Detects Tests Internally (Overview for Curiosity)

- Test macros like `TEST()` internally declare objects derived from GoogleTest’s internal registries.
- These objects register test suite and test names into global registries during static initialization.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` walks through these registries and runs test bodies.

For most users, understanding internal implementation is not necessary; focus on correctly defining tests and linking them.

## Summary

Understanding how GoogleTest discovers and runs tests helps you write, compile, and execute tests effectively with confidence. Automated registration, combined with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and proper initialization, ensures effortless test execution. When tests don’t run, systematic checking of build linkage, initialization calls, and use of diagnostic flags quickly resolves most issues.

<Tip>
Remember: You do not need to manually register or enumerate your tests; just define tests with `TEST` macros, initialize GoogleTest properly, and call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` once.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` multiple times or missing initialization calls, your tests may silently not execute or report unexpected behaviors.
</Warning>

## Example Main Functions Provided by GoogleMock

GoogleMock provides built-in main implementations for many platforms (see [gmock_main.cc](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/src/gmock_main.cc)) with these key points:

- Calls to `testing::InitGoogleMock()` initialize both GoogleMock and GoogleTest.
- Embedded platforms (ESP8266, ESP32) use `setup()` and `loop()` as entry points.
- On Windows and other common platforms, a standard `main(int argc, char** argv)` runs all tests.

You can use these default mains by linking with `gmock_main` instead of writing your own main.
