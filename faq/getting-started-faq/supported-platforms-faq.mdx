# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

This documentation provides comprehensive details on the supported operating systems, compilers, and build systems for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It helps users verify compatibility and ensure a smooth integration of GoogleTest into their C++ projects.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest follows Googleâ€™s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to maintain consistent, reliable support across platforms and compiler versions. It requires environments that support the C++17 standard or newer.

The compatibility includes but is not limited to Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, alongside popular compilers such as GCC, Clang, and MSVC.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

- **Linux**: Many distributions with glibc-based toolchains.
- **Windows**: Desktop (including Visual Studio toolchain), MinGW support.
- **macOS**: Supported via Clang and Xcode toolchains.
- **BSD Variants**: FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD.
- **Unix-like Systems**: Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS.
- **Embedded and Special Platforms**:
  - Google Native Client (NaCl).
  - Android (with version specifics).
  - Others with partial support (such as Haiku, GNU/Hurd).

> The full list and details can be found in the [Supported Platforms official matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Supported Compilers and Toolchains

GoogleTest supports major C++ compilers capable of compiling code with C++17 or later. This includes:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) from versions supporting C++17 onward.
- **Clang/LLVM** with C++17 support.
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** 2017 Update 3 and later.
- **Intel C++ Compiler** and others adhering to C++17 compatibility.

Users should ensure the compiler is invoked with flags to target C++17 (or above), for example:

```bash
# GCC or Clang
 -std=c++17

# MSVC
 /std:c++17
```

---

## Build Systems Integration

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with common build systems, notably:

- **CMake**: Official primary build system, providing comprehensive scripts to build GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Supports standalone build and integration as a subproject.
- **Bazel**: Supported via community rules enabling Bazel-based builds.
- **pkg-config**: GoogleTest supplies pkg-config files for easy discovery.

### Example: Standalone CMake Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

To build only GoogleTest without GoogleMock:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

### CMake Integration in Your Project

Add the following in your project `CMakeLists.txt` to include GoogleTest as a subdirectory:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(your_test your_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_test gtest gtest_main)
add_test(NAME your_test COMMAND your_test)
```

---

## Important Platform-Specific Notes

- **Thread Safety**: GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthreads or Windows threading support. The macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` indicates thread safety detection.
- **Exception Support**: GoogleTest detects if exceptions are enabled via macros like `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`.
- **Regular Expressions**: GoogleTest adapts to platform regex availability, using RE2, POSIX regex, or its simple regex implementation accordingly.

## Where to Find Full and Up-to-Date Support Details

For the most current information about supported platforms, compilers, and build systems, consult:

- [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)
- [GoogleTest Supported Platforms Guide](/overview/integration-ecosystem/supported-platforms)

When in doubt, verify compiler versions, OS versions, and C++17 support before integrating GoogleTest.

---

## Common Issues and Recommendations

### Build Failures or Linking Errors

- Verify your compiler and linker support C++17.
- Ensure you link with required pthread libraries when built on Unix-like platforms.
- Use provided CMake scripts or pkg-config files to properly locate headers and libraries.

### Runtime Issues

- Confirm that your platform's thread facilities and exception support match GoogleTest's expectations.
- Consult the platform-specific notes in case of missing regular expression support or unsupported APIs.
