# Supported Platforms and Environments

GoogleTest ensures that you can write and run C++ tests confidently across a wide range of platforms and environments. This page helps you understand which compilers, operating systems, and tooling configurations are officially supported, so you can determine if GoogleTest fits your project’s needs.

---

## 1. What Platforms Does GoogleTest Support?

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), which defines the officially supported C++ compilers, platforms, and build tools.

For an up-to-date and detailed list of supported versions, see the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

Key supported operating systems include:

- **Windows** (including Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants like Windows Phone and Windows RT)
- **Linux** (general Linux distros and Android)
- **macOS** and **iOS**
- **Other UNIX-like platforms** such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX
- **Embedded and specialized systems** including ESP8266, ESP32, QNX, Haiku, DragonFlyBSD

GoogleTest strives to offer stable, consistent support on common platforms and compilers, with more limited support on niche or embedded platforms.

## 2. How Does GoogleTest Detect Your Platform?

GoogleTest automatically detects the environment at compile-time through platform-indicating macros defined in its internal portability layer (`gtest-port-arch.h` and `gtest-port.h`). Some of these macros include:

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_ANDROID`, `GTEST_OS_IOS`, etc.
- Specialized macros for Windows MiniGW, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, and other variants.

This automatic detection enables GoogleTest to conditionally enable features or adjust for environment-specific quirks, so you generally do not need to manually configure platform settings.

If your environment is unusual or not detected correctly, you can override these platform macros by defining `GTEST_OS_*` macros explicitly during compilation.

---

## 3. Supported Compilers and Build Systems

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ environment supporting at least **C++17**.

Supports include:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) with versions supporting C++17
- **Clang/LLVM** with C++17 capability
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++), version 19.11 (VS 2017 Update 3) or newer
- Other compilers like SunPro, IBM XL, HP aCC with appropriate C++17 support

For building, GoogleTest offers:

- **CMake-based builds**: The recommended build system, automatically detecting your compiler, platform, and threading capabilities.
- Integration with **Bazel** is also supported.

By default, GoogleTest builds with support for threads (`pthreads` on UNIX-like, Windows threading), exceptions, RTTI, and filesystem I/O when available.

### Important Build-Related Macros

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` can be overridden to force pthreads on or off.
- `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY` and `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` control shared/static library settings.
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` reflect environment capabilities.

Refer to [`gtest-port.h`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h) for a full list of these configuration macros.

---

## 4. Thread Safety and Platform-Specific Features

GoogleTest is fully **thread-safe** on platforms that support pthreads (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`), such as Linux, macOS, and many UNIX-like OSes.

On Windows and some embedded platforms, threading support may be limited or disabled by default.

Support for features like **death tests**, stream redirection, and exception handling varies by platform:

- Death tests require file system access, so they are only supported on platforms with filesystem and required capabilities.
- Stream redirection typically works on Windows Desktop, Linux, and macOS, but not on certain embedded or mobile variants.

Refer to the platform macros such as `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` and `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` defined by GoogleTest based on platform capabilities.

---

## 5. Embedded and Special Platforms

GoogleTest also supports certain embedded platforms and specialized processors, including:

- **ESP8266, ESP32** microcontrollers
- **NXP QN9090** and **NRF52** microcontrollers
- **XTENSA** and **QURT** architectures

Support here focuses on the testing framework's portability layer to accommodate these environments’ limitations.

For example, on Arduino-like platforms (ESP8266, ESP32), GoogleTest’s entry point adapts to use `setup()` and `loop()` functions instead of `main()`.

However, functionality such as file system access, multithreading, and exceptions may be limited or unavailable.

---

## 6. Practical Tips for Choosing a Platform

- **Verify your compiler supports C++17 or greater.** GoogleTest enforces this at compile time.

- **Check if your OS and toolchain are listed in the Foundational C++ Support Matrix.** This ensures compatibility with GoogleTest’s portability code.

- For full featured use, prefer mainstream platforms (Windows Desktop, Linux, macOS).

- If building for embedded or uncommon environments, be prepared to tweak macro overrides and feature flags as needed.

- Use GoogleTest’s CMake integration to automatically manage most platform-specific settings.

- For Windows, take care to handle runtime settings (`gtest_force_shared_crt`) to avoid conflicts between static/dynamic CRT linkage.

---

## 7. How to Check Platform Support in Your Environment

You can verify your current build environment’s support status by inspecting GoogleTest’s platform macros after including `gtest/gtest.h`:

```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  #ifdef GTEST_OS_WINDOWS
  std::cout << "Platform: Windows" << std::endl;
  #elif defined(GTEST_OS_LINUX)
  std::cout << "Platform: Linux" << std::endl;
  #elif defined(GTEST_OS_MAC)
  std::cout << "Platform: macOS" << std::endl;
  #else
  std::cout << "Platform: Unknown or Unsupported" << std::endl;
  #endif

  #if GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD
  std::cout << "Threading support: pthread available" << std::endl;
  #else
  std::cout << "Threading support: pthread NOT available" << std::endl;
  #endif

  return 0;
}
```

Running such code gives you immediate insight into how GoogleTest perceives your platform and feature availability.

## 8. Troubleshooting Platform Issues

If you encounter compilation or linkage errors related to platform features:

- Verify compiler version and its C++ standard support (`-std=c++17` or equivalent).
- Check that your build flags do not disable necessary features (e.g., exceptions, RTTI, threading).
- Confirm that environment macros (such as `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) are consistent with your actual platform.
- Use GoogleTest’s detailed debugging and log capture flags.
- If necessary, override platform detection macros manually (e.g., defining `GTEST_OS_LINUX=1` explicitly).
