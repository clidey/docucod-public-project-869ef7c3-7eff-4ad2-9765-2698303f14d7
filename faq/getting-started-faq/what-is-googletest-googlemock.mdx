# What is GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock together form a unified, modern C++ testing framework designed to help developers write robust, maintainable, and expressive tests. GoogleTest provides the core testing infrastructure with features such as automated test discovery, versatile assertions, test fixtures, parameterized tests, and support for cross-platform development. GoogleMock extends this framework by offering powerful mocking capabilities, enabling precise control over dependencies and interactions in your test code.

This page explains the purpose, value, and typical use cases of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, clarifying why developers should consider using them together for comprehensive C++ testing.

## Introduction

Developers write tests to verify the behavior of code under different conditions. However, complex software often depends on external modules or components that may be slow, unavailable, or difficult to control during testing. GoogleTest and GoogleMock address these challenges by:

- **GoogleTest:** Providing a flexible, xUnit-style framework for structuring and running tests.
- **GoogleMock:** Allowing creation of mock classes that simulate real dependencies with controllable behaviors and expectations.

By using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, developers can isolate code under test, simulate complex interactions, verify call sequences, and produce clear, actionable test failures.

## Purpose and Value of GoogleTest

GoogleTest is Google's C++ testing framework. Its key capabilities include:

- **Automated Test Discovery:** No manual registration needed. Tests registered via macros (`TEST()`, `TEST_F()`) are discovered and run automatically.
- **Robust Assertions:** Provides a rich set of assertions for checking conditions, including boolean, equality, string, floating-point, predicate-based, and exception assertions.
- **Test Fixtures:** Support grouping related tests with shared setup and teardown, improving readability and reducing duplication.
- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic across multiple data combinations.
- **Death Tests:** Verify program behavior under abnormal or error conditions.
- **Cross-platform Support:** Works consistently across Linux, Windows, Mac, and other supported platforms.

Use GoogleTest when you want a reliable, well-supported way to write and manage your C++ tests, and benefit from structured, repeatable verification.

## Purpose and Value of GoogleMock

GoogleMock is a mocking framework integrated with GoogleTest. It empowers you to replace real objects with mock objects in your tests, controlling their behavior precisely and verifying interactions. This is especially useful when:

- The real objects are difficult to set up, slow, or cause flakiness.
- You want to focus tests on specific behaviors or sequences of calls.
- You need to simulate error conditions or specific responses from dependencies.

Key features of GoogleMock include:

- **Declarative Mock Definitions:** Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to define mock methods in derived classes easily.
- **Matchers:** Express flexible argument expectations using built-in or custom matchers (e.g., matching values, ranges, properties).
- **Expectations and Cardinalities:** Specify how many times and in what order methods are called (`EXPECT_CALL`, `Times`, `InSequence`).
- **Actions:** Define what mocks do when called (`Return`, `Invoke`, `SetArgPointee`, etc.), including chaining multiple actions.
- **Strictness Modes:** Control how uninteresting calls are treated using `NiceMock` (ignore warnings), `NaggyMock` (warn by default), and `StrictMock` (fail tests on uninteresting calls).
- **Support for Mocking Complex C++ Features:** Handle overloaded functions, virtual and non-virtual methods, move-only types, templates, and more.
- **Delegation Patterns:** Easily delegate default behavior to fakes or real objects.

GoogleMock helps achieve highly controllable, interaction-based testing.

## Why Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock Together?

The integration of GoogleMock within GoogleTest makes it seamless to:

- Define mocks and write tests in the same framework.
- Leverage GoogleTest's assertions and discovery while controlling dependencies with mocks.
- Run verification automatically when mocks are destructed, catching failures early.
- Configure how mocks behave in terms of strictness and interaction verification.

By using both, you can write maintainable tests that are fast, reliable, expressive, and reflective of real usage patterns.

---

## When Should You Use These Tools?

- **GoogleTest Alone:** For general unit tests that do not depend heavily on external dependencies or require interaction verification.
- **GoogleMock:** When you have dependencies or collaborators that need to be simulated or monitored precisely.
- **Both Together:** For comprehensive tests that require not just asserting state, but also verifying the behavior and interaction contracts of components.

## Getting Started

To get started quickly:

1. Write your first GoogleTest test suite using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`. See [Writing and Running Your First Test](../getting-started/gs-configuration-first-test/gs-first-test.md).
2. Define basic mocks using `MOCK_METHOD` macros. Check [Creating and Using Basic Mocks](../guides/mocking-scenarios/creating-basic-mocks.md).
3. Specify expectations on mock objects using `EXPECT_CALL` and customize behavior with actions and matchers.
4. Use strictness modes (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) to control warnings and errors for uninteresting calls.

---

## Practical Example

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PaintTest, DrawLine) {
  using ::testing::AtLeast;
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));

  // Code under test goes here, exercising MockTurtle.
}
```

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Always set expectations before exercising the mock object; otherwise, behavior is undefined.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for defining default behavior, reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for verification needs.
- Avoid over-specifying calls which leads to brittle tests; specify only what matters.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls if you don't care about all calls.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) for specifying call order requirements.
- Mock only interfaces or abstract types if possible; avoid mocking concrete classes to reduce brittleness.
- Be mindful of mock destructors and explicit verification calls if mocks are heap-allocated.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Validate your setup and environment with [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](../getting-started/gs-prerequisites-installation/gs-system-requirements.md).
- Check [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/gs-validation-troubleshooting/gs-troubleshooting-common-issues.md).

---

## Tips

- Use mock strictness modes thoughtfully: `NiceMock` for general use, `NaggyMock` for debugging, and `StrictMock` when you want to enforce interactions.
- Delegate to fakes or real objects when you want mock behavior combined with realistic implementations.
- Employ matchers to express flexible argument constraints rather than hardcoding values.
