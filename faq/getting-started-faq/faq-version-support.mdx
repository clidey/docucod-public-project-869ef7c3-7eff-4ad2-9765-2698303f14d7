# Which Platforms, Compilers, and C++ Standards Are Supported?

This page is your practical reference to the environments where GoogleTest and GoogleMock reliably operate. It highlights supported platforms, the minimal C++ standard requirement, recommended compilers, and how to verify compatibility for your development needs. Whether you are integrating into existing projects or starting fresh, this guide ensures you work in a tested, stable environment.

---

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest officially supports a wide range of operating systems and environments, ensuring broad applicability:

- **Linux** (including common distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS)
- **macOS** (modern versions compatible with the required C++17)
- **Windows** (desktop versions, including builds with Visual Studio and MinGW)
- **BSD variants** (including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD)
- **Embedded Systems** and specialized platforms (to some extent, with user customization)

The platform support includes desktop and server-grade environments, with stronger test stability guaranteed on widely used systems. Some less common platforms may work but have limited official support.

<Tip>
For unusual or embedded platforms, ensure you conduct compatibility validations as part of your integration process.
</Tip>

## Compiler and C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires a **C++17** compliant compiler. This standard enables modern, safe, and performant C++ constructs used extensively across the framework.

### Supported Compiler Versions:
- **GCC:** Version 7.0 and later
- **Clang:** Version 5.0 and later
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC):** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (version 19.11) or higher
- **Intel Compiler:** Recent versions with C++17 support

It is critical to ensure your compiler is configured to target at least C++17, which you can enforce via your build system settings, for example:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

or via compiler flags, such as `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang.

<Check>
Using a compiler without proper C++17 support will cause build failures or subtle runtime issues.
</Check>

## Threading and Exception Handling

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms and compilers that support pthreads or Windows threading primitives robustly. This threading support enables parallel test execution and synchronization.

If pthreads detection fails, or your environment does not provide pthreads, GoogleTest can be configured with compile-time macros to enable or disable threading support.

Exception support is detected automatically, but you can override this if needed. GoogleTest will work best with exceptions enabled but can compile without them if configured explicitly.

## Verification and Compatibility Checks

You can verify your setup's compatibility by:

- Confirming your compiler supports C++17 via version checks or flags.
- Inspecting platform macros and flags, for example by checking `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` or `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` via preprocessor defines.
- Running the GoogleTest sample tests after building (see the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/prereq-install/installation-guide) to build and run sample tests).

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Compiler Version">
Use commands like `gcc --version`, `clang --version` or review your Visual Studio version.
</Step>
<Step title="Set C++ Standard in Build">
Ensure C++17 is specified in your project build files.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Sample GoogleTest Suite">
Build and run Google's own sample test executable to verify environment correctness.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Cross-Platform Development

- Consistently specify `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17` or equivalent in your build scripts.
- Use the official GoogleTest CMake build scripts as they handle many platform differences internally.
- Check for and use recommended compiler and toolchain versions to avoid subtle incompatibilities.
- For Windows, if you encounter runtime library conflicts, leverage the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime linkage.
- Regularly validate builds on all targeted platforms to catch regressions early.

## Troubleshooting Platform-Specific Issues

- On **Windows**, linking errors due to multi-threaded runtime mismatches are common; adjust your project settings or enable the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option.
- On **Mac and Linux**, if pthreads are not detected properly, verify installation of development packages and avoid restrictive sandboxed environments.
- Embedded or less common platforms may require defining specific compiler flags or disabling unsupported features.

See the [Installation Guide](/getting-started/prereq-install/installation-guide) and [Configuration Basics](/getting-started/prereq-install/configuration-basics) for platform-specific guidance.

## Practical Example: Specifying Minimum C++ Version in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject CXX)

# Set C++17 as required standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add GoogleTest
add_subdirectory(googletest)

# Your test target
add_executable(mytests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(mytests gtest_main)
```

This ensures your entire project, including GoogleTest dependencies, target a compatible standard.
