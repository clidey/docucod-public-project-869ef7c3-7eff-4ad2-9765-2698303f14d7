# General Overview & Common Questions

This FAQ addresses common questions about GoogleTest and GoogleMock, helping you understand what these frameworks are, how they complement each other, typical use cases, and where to start learning more.

---

## What is GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is Google's open-source C++ unit testing framework, designed to help developers write reliable, maintainable, and comprehensive tests. It provides:

- Automatic test discovery and organization into test suites and tests
- Rich assertions for validating code behavior
- Support for fixtures to share common setup and teardown logic across tests
- Parameterized tests for testing different inputs without duplication
- Facilities to run tests selectively or in repeat and shuffled order

GoogleTest is well-suited for both beginner and advanced users and integrates gracefully with various build systems and platforms.

For a thorough introduction, see the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html).

## What is GoogleMock and how does it relate to GoogleTest?

GoogleMock (gMock) is an extension to GoogleTest that provides a powerful framework for creating and using mock classes in C++. Mocks allow you to simulate and verify the behavior of dependencies in isolation, enabling more focused and robust testing.

Key features of GoogleMock include:

- Declarative syntax to define mock classes and methods
- Support for partial mocks combining real and mocked behavior
- Overload and arbitrary function signature handling
- Rich set of matchers for mocking function call arguments
- Intuitive control of mock behavior and invocation expectations
- Automatic verification of expected calls without manual recording or replay
- Extensibility to create custom matchers and actions

GoogleMock is distributed as part of the combined GoogleTest repository and shares the same interface and release process.

Learn more at the [gMock README](googletest/googlemock/README.md) and the [Mocking for Dummies guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html).

## When should I use GoogleTest alone or with GoogleMock?

- **GoogleTest only:** If your tests focus on verifying the behavior of functions or classes that do not depend on complex external interactions, GoogleTest alone is sufficient. Writing tests with assertions and fixtures covers many typical unit testing needs.

- **GoogleTest with GoogleMock:** When your code depends on external modules, interfaces, or services that are impractical or costly to involve in testing (for example, network calls, databases, hardware), you should use GoogleMock to simulate these dependencies. GoogleMock lets you specify expected interactions, validate argument values, and control mock behaviors to isolate and verify your component more precisely.

## What platforms and environments are supported?

GoogleTest is designed with portability in mind and supports:

- Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms
- Various compilers that conform at least to C++17
- Environments with and without exceptions enabled
- Integration with popular build systems such as CMake and Bazel

GoogleMock inherits all platform support from GoogleTest.

See the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](https://google.github.io/googletest/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.html) for a detailed compatibility matrix.

## How do I get started using GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

Start by following these steps:

1. **Install and configure GoogleTest:** Use your preferred build system or package manager to add GoogleTest to your project.
2. **Write your first test:** Define a simple test using the `TEST` macro, add assertions, and run the test suite.
3. **Learn fixtures:** Use `TEST_F` to create test suites sharing common setup logic.
4. **Explore parameterized tests:** Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to run tests with different inputs.
5. **Add mocks when needed:** Define mock classes with GoogleMock and use them to simulate dependencies.

We highly recommend the following resources:

## How do GoogleTest and GoogleMock fit into my development and CI workflow?

- Automatically discover and run all tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.
- Use `InitGoogleTest()` to parse flags and customize test programs.
- Utilize command line flags and environment variables to filter tests, shuffle order, and repeat tests.
- Generate XML or JSON reports for CI systems using the `--gtest_output` flag.
- Use GoogleMock to mock dependencies, specify call expectations, and verify behavior.
- Extend test reporting with event listeners to customize console output or integrate with other tools.

See the [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](https://google.github.io/googletest/advanced.html) and the [Test Integration and Build](https://google.github.io/googletest/test_integration_build.html) guides for in-depth coverage.

## Common questions

### What’s the difference between a test and a test suite?
- A **test** (sometimes called a test case in other frameworks) is a single function checking specific behavior.
- A **test suite** groups related tests, usually sharing a fixture.

### Can I write tests for private or internal code?
- It's best to test through the public interface.
- If needed, you can declare tests as friends using `FRIEND_TEST` or separate internal code into testable components.

### How do I deal with flaky or non-deterministic tests?
- Use `--gtest_repeat` to run tests multiple times.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` with a fixed seed to identify ordering dependencies.

### Can I dynamically register tests?
- Yes, using `testing::RegisterTest()` for advanced scenarios.

### What if tests need shared setup/teardown?
- Use static `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` methods in test fixtures.
- Use global `Environment` objects for application-wide setup.
