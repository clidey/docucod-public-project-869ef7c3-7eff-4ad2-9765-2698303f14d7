# Installation, Requirements & Compatibility FAQ

This FAQ provides clear, practical answers to common questions about platform support, compiler needs, and ensuring compatibility for building and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It helps you confirm your development environment is properly prepared and highlights tips to avoid common pitfalls during setup.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

**Q: On which operating systems can I build and run GoogleTest and GoogleMock?**  
A: GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms including Linux, Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants), macOS, Android, and several Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD, Solaris, and AIX. The support follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring portability and consistency across these environments.

**Q: Are there embedded or special platform limitations?**  
A: Some embedded or specialized platforms like ESP8266, ESP32, and QuRT have limited support, particularly for features like file system access or threading. Check the support matrix linked below for detailed coverage.

**Q: Where can I find a complete list of supported platforms and compilers?**  
A: Refer to the detailed platform and compiler matrix on GitHub [here](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## 2. Compiler Requirements and C++ Standard

**Q: What are the minimum C++ standard and compiler versions required?**  
A: GoogleTest requires the C++17 standard for building. Supported compilers include GCC (7.0+ recommended), Clang, Intel LLVM, and MSVC (Visual Studio 2015 or later). Your compiler must have full C++17 feature compliance.

**Q: How do I ensure C++17 is enforced in my build system?**  
A: For CMake projects, set the following in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Alternatively, add appropriate compiler flags such as `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang manually.

**Q: Are there any special compiler flags recommended for building GoogleTest?**  
A: Yes, GoogleTest's CMake build script adjusts compiler settings for common compilers, enhancing warnings and compatibility. For example, MSVC projects override default flags to use more strict warning levels and static runtimes unless configured otherwise. You can use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to match your project's runtime library linkage.

## 3. Threading and Runtime Dependencies

**Q: Does GoogleTest require threading support?**  
A: GoogleTest is thread-safe when built with pthread support on platforms where it is available. It requires threading features for advanced testing patterns and parallel test execution.

**Q: How do I enable or disable pthread support?**  
A: The CMake build attempts to detect pthread availability automatically, but you can enforce it by defining `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0`. Note that pthread is generally unavailable or unsupported on some platforms such as MinGW.

**Q: Are there any known issues related to threading on Windows?**  
A: On Windows, GoogleTest uses native Windows threading primitives. When using MinGW, pthreads are not supported by GoogleTest and Windows threading primitives are used instead.

## 4. Using GoogleTest as Shared or Static Libraries

**Q: Can I build GoogleTest and GoogleMock as shared libraries (DLLs)?**  
A: Yes, both GoogleTest and GoogleMock can be built as static or shared libraries. Use `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building the libraries.

**Q: What compiler flags do I need to link against shared GoogleTest libraries?**  
A: When linked as shared libraries, add the flag `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when compiling your test code to ensure proper API decorations and linkage.

**Q: How do I avoid runtime library mismatches in Visual Studio?**  
A: By default, Visual Studio uses dynamic CRT linkage, while GoogleTest defaults to static. Enable the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align GoogleTest with your project settings and prevent linker errors.

## 5. Common Integration Tips and Pitfalls

**Q: How do I integrate GoogleTest in my existing CMake project?**  
A: The recommended way is to use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` if GoogleTest is installed. Alternatively, include GoogleTest source as a subdirectory using `add_subdirectory()` for consistent compiler settings.

**Q: What should I do if I encounter macro name conflicts with GoogleTest?**  
A: Use compiler flags like `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` to prefix macros with `GTEST_` and avoid collisions with other libraries.

**Q: How can I verify that my compiler supports the required C++17 features?**  
A: Attempt to build a minimal test program with C++17 enabled. Alternatively, rely on GoogleTest's CMake build which enforces `cxx_std_17` feature.

**Q: Are exceptions, RTTI, and wide strings supported and required?**  
A: GoogleTest requires exceptions and RTTI enabled by default. Most mainstream compilers support these. Wide string support depends on the platform but is generally available on major OSes.

## 6. Troubleshooting Environment and Compatibility Issues

**Q: What should I do if my build fails due to compiler version or standard library issues?**  
A: Ensure your compiler version is recent enough. For example, MSVC must be 2015 or later. If your environment does not fully support C++17, upgrade your toolchain or adjust compiler flags accordingly.

**Q: How to fix linker errors related to pthread or missing threading symbols?**  
A: Link with pthread explicitly if your build system does not do so automatically. In CMake, this is handled when `Threads` package is found and linked.

**Q: What if I encounter errors related to macro redefinitions?**  
A: Use the `GTEST_DONT_DEFINE_*` flags to rename conflicting macros.

**Q: How can I get diagnostic information about platform detection and build settings?**  
A: Enable verbose output of your build system. GoogleTest's CMake scripts print messages about pthread detection and compiler flags.

<Tip>
Always verify your compiler and build settings explicitly support C++17, exceptions, and RTTI to avoid subtle build failures.
</Tip>
<Note>
Using GoogleTest as a git submodule or FetchContent in CMake helps keep your test dependencies up to date and consistent.
</Note>
<Warning>
Static vs dynamic runtime mismatches on Windows are a common cause for linker errors; use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option if needed.
</Warning>
