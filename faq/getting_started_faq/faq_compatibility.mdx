# Supported Platforms & C++ Standards

This page clarifies the supported C++ language versions, operating systems, compiler toolchains, and explains how to troubleshoot common compatibility issues encountered when building or running GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

---

## Supported C++ Standards

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a modern C++ compiler that supports **C++17** or later.

- Ensure your compiler is configured to use at least **C++17**.
- For projects using CMake, specify this requirement explicitly:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If you override this in your build system, verify the compatibility carefully as using older or non-conforming compilers will lead to build failures.

### Common Compatibility Errors Related to C++ Versions

- **Error:** Compiler reports unsupported language features or keywords.
  - **Cause:** Compiler is defaulting to an older C++ standard.
  - **Solution:** Enable `-std=c++17` or equivalent flag for your compiler.

- **Error:** ABI incompatibilities or linkage errors involving STL symbols.
  - **Cause:** Compiler or standard library versions do not match.
  - **Solution:** Make sure all components and dependencies are built with consistent C++ standard versions.

## Supported Operating Systems & Platforms

GoogleTest supports all major desktop platforms with active maintenance:

- **Linux**: Most distributions with modern GNU or Clang toolchains
- **Windows**: Visual Studio 2015 (VS 14.0) and newer
- **macOS**: Recent versions with Clang compiler

### Platform Details

- The minimum supported version of MS Visual C++ is **Visual Studio 2015 (14.0)**. Attempts to build with older versions will fail.
- On Linux and macOS, GCC 7+ or clang 5+ are recommended for full C++17 support.

### Toolchain & Build Requirements

- **Build Tools:** CMake 3.14 or newer is required for seamless build and integration.
- **Threading:** GoogleTest depends on pthreads for thread safety. Ensure pthread libraries are correctly linked.
- On Windows, some additional runtime considerations apply; see Visual Studio note below.

## Troubleshooting Common Platform Issues

### Visual Studio Runtime Library Mismatches

When building GoogleTest as a static library and linking to your project using dynamic runtime libraries, you may encounter
linker errors like:

```
gtest.lib(gtest-all.obj) : error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'RuntimeLibrary'
```

**Resolution:**

Enable the CMake option to force GoogleTest to link using the shared C runtime by
adding this before building:

```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```

This ensures runtime libraries match between your project and GoogleTest.

### Compiler Versions and Flags

- Verify that your compiler supports the required C++17 features.
- On build failure, check error messages for possible missing flags like `-std=c++17`.
- For GNU compilers, use `-std=c++17` and ensure you have a recent version (GCC 7+).
- For Clang, use equivalent flags.

### Multi-threading Support

GoogleTest is thread-safe when compiled with pthread support enabled on Unix-like systems.

- If GoogleTest does not detect pthread during configuration, tests may be single-threaded or unsafe.
- You can force pthread enablement explicitly:

```
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

- On **macOS**, the default Clang should support C++17, but if using an older Xcode, upgrade to a newer version.
- On **Windows**, ensure that your Visual Studio installation is up to date and supports the C++17 standard.

## Summary Table

| Platform  | Minimum Compiler Version           | Notes                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------|
| Linux     | GCC 7+, Clang 5+                 | Pthread support required     |
| Windows   | Visual Studio 2015 (MSVC 14.0)   | Match runtime libraries      |
| macOS     | Clang with Xcode >= 10            | Use latest Xcode if possible |

## Best Practices & Recommendations

- Always specify C++17 in your project build configuration when using GoogleTest.
- Keep your compiler and toolchains updated to supported versions.
- Use CMake 3.14+ and its `FetchContent` or `add_subdirectory` commands to integrate GoogleTest smoothly.
- On Windows, ensure runtime library settings are consistent between your project and GoogleTest.
- For CI and automated environments, verify platform shells have required pthread or compatible threading support.

## When You Encounter Issues

### Step-by-step Troubleshooting Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Compiler Version">
    Confirm your compiler is versioned to support C++17 or newer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Build Flags">
    Ensure that the `-std=c++17` (or equivalent) flag is set in your compilation commands.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Platform Compatibility">
    Verify that you are building on a supported OS and with a compatible compiler.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve Runtime Mismatches on Windows">
    Enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in your CMakeLists.txt to align runtime libraries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ensure Threading Support">
    Enable pthread support if your platform requires it via `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consult Logs and Error Messages">
    Review compiler and linker output carefully, focusing on errors about language features and libraries.
  </Step>
</Steps>
