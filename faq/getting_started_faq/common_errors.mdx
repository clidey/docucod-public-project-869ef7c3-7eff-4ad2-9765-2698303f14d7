# Common Errors and Troubleshooting

This page provides a focused guide to help users quickly identify, understand, and resolve common errors encountered when writing or running tests using GoogleTest, GoogleMock, or both combined. Whether you face test failures, linking issues, or unexpected mock behaviors, this guide walks you through diagnosing and fixing these problems efficiently.

## 1. Common Error Types and Solutions

### 1.1. Test Failures

GoogleTest reports failures when assertions within tests fail or when test expectations are unmet. Below are frequent causes and their remedies:

- **Assertion Failures**: Occur when an `EXPECT_` or `ASSERT_` macro fails, such as `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)` where values differ.
  - **How to Troubleshoot**:
    1. Inspect the failure message for expected vs actual values.
    2. Verify the correctness of test logic, inputs, and mock setups.
    3. Use streaming messages for extra context, e.g., `EXPECT_EQ(a, b) << "Context here";`.

- **Unmet Mock Expectations**:
  - This happens when a mock method is called fewer or more times than specified by `EXPECT_CALL`.
  - **Diagnose by**:
    - Reviewing the cardinality and call count failure messages.
    - Checking the order constraints such as `.InSequence()` and `.After()` usages.

### 1.2. Linking Errors

Linking errors typically occur during build when GoogleTest or GoogleMock symbols are missing.

- **Common Causes:**
  - Missing linkage to GoogleTest or GoogleMock static/shared libraries.
  - Incorrect build or install paths.
  - Missing `gmock_main` library or failure to link with GoogleMock’s main when using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure your build system links `gtest` and `gmock` libraries correctly.
  - When using GoogleMock with the test runner, link against `gmock_main` to get a ready-made `main()`.
  - Check include paths and library directories.
  - Refer to the [Integrating GoogleTest with CMake and Bazel](../guides/real-world-patterns/integration-build.md) guide.

### 1.3. Mocking Errors and Warnings

GoogleMock may report warnings or errors related to mocks and expectations:

- **Uninteresting Calls**:
  - Occur when a mock method is called without an existing `EXPECT_CALL` and with `NaggyMock` or default mock behavior.
  - To suppress, use `NiceMock<T>` or explicitly define `ON_CALL()` default behaviors.

- **Too Many or Too Few Actions**:
  - Warnings appear when `EXPECT_CALL` has more `WillOnce()` actions than allowed by the cardinality.
  - Review your expectation action chains to ensure correct `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.WillRepeatedly()` usage.

- **Unexpected Calls**:
  - Calls that don't match any active expectation.
  - Check argument matchers and ensure correct sequencing.
  - Use informative failure messages provided by GoogleMock to adjust expectations.

- **Mock Object Lifetime**:
  - Use `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_ptr)` if your mocks intentionally outlive test scope.
  - Be cautious with mock destruction in actions to avoid dangling pointers.

## 2. Diagnosing Common Error Messages

Below are interpretations of typical error messages and strategies to debug them:

### 2.1. ``‘Expected equality of these values’``

Indicates an `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_EQ` failure.

- **Root Cause**: Actual and expected values differ.
- **Next Steps**: Compare values carefully. For complex types, consider implementing stream operators or custom matchers for clearer messages.

### 2.2. ``‘Unexpected mock function call’``

Occurs when a mock method is called without a matching active `EXPECT_CALL`.

- **Root Cause**: Either the method was not expected to be called or argument matchers didn't match.
- **Fix**: Add appropriate `EXPECT_CALL` with correct argument matchers.

### 2.3. ``‘Uninteresting mock function call’`` with `GMOCK_WARNING`

Warning emitted for calls to mocks without expectations when using `NaggyMock`.

- **How to Address**: Add explicit `EXPECT_CALL`, switch to `NiceMock`, or define `ON_CALL` defaults.

### 2.4. ``‘Mock function called more times than expected’``

Signifies that a mock method was invoked beyond the specified `.Times()` limit.

- **Action**: Check the number of times the mock method is called in your test code and adjust `.Times()` accordingly.

### 2.5. Linking Errors

Common linker errors mention missing symbols like `_ZN7testing4Test...`.

- **Check**:
  - Correctly linked GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries.
  - Consistent build settings (debug vs release).

## 3. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Procedures

<Steps>
<Step title="Test Failures">
Examine the output logs for assertion failure messages and stack traces.
Verify that the test input and mock setup match expected scenarios.
Add more detailed messages to assertions for context.
</Step>
<Step title="Mock Expectations Not Met">
Check call order and cardinality constraints.
Make sure `EXPECT_CALL` matches the actual calls and their arguments.
Add `.Times()`, `.InSequence()`, or `.After()` clauses as needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Linking Errors">
Confirm that your build system links with GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
If your test binary requires `main()`, link `gmock_main` or provide your own.
Review include paths and library paths.
</Step>
<Step title="Uninteresting Calls or Warnings">
Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings during prototyping.
Add `ON_CALL` with `WillByDefault` to define default behaviors.
Review mock strictness and adjust as needed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Best Practices to Prevent Errors

- Always initialize GoogleTest and GoogleMock correctly using `InitGoogleTest` and `InitGoogleMock`.
- Define `EXPECT_CALL` expectations before exercising mocks.
- Use clear and specific argument matchers rather than wildcards `_` when verifying calls.
- Prefer using `NiceMock` or `NaggyMock` appropriately to manage uninteresting call behaviors.
- Regularly verify mock expectations using `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`.
- Avoid leaking mocks unintentionally; use `Mock::AllowLeak()` only when necessary.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to deactivate expectations once saturated.
- Follow consistent naming and organization to simplify diagnostics.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips & Resources

- Consult detailed failure messages provided by GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Enable verbose mock warnings using the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` for deeper insight.
- Use `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` macros in test code to validate expected error states.
- Generate XML or JSON reports via `--gtest_output=xml:folder/` for integration with CI systems.
- Refer to foundational documentation pages like [Writing and Structuring Basic Tests](../guides/getting-started/writing-basic-tests.md) and [Mocking Fundamentals](../api-reference/core-apis/mocking-core-api.md) for setup help.

## 6. Additional Support

If problems persist:

- Review the [Troubleshooting & FAQ](../getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting.md) guide.
- Search or ask questions on the official [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- Consult community forums for tips on specific error messages.

### Example: Diagnosing a Mock Too Many Calls Failure

```cpp
using ::testing::Mock;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n), ());
};

MockFoo mock_foo;

EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(42))
  .Times(1)
  .WillOnce(Return(7));

mock_foo.Bar(42);  // This call succeeds
mock_foo.Bar(42);  // This call triggers "too many calls" failure

// To fix, either:
// - Reduce mock_foo.Bar(42) calls to 1
// - Or increase .Times(2)
```

### Example: Resolving Linking Errors with CMake

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp my_tests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gtest GTest::gmock_main pthread)
```
