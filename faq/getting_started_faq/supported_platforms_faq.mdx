# FAQ: Which platforms and compilers does GoogleTest support?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to provide reliable, portable C++ testing and mocking capabilities across a wide variety of platforms and compilers. This FAQ covers the officially supported platforms, compilers, and C++ standards, giving you confidence about where GoogleTest can be used effectively.

## 1. Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports many popular platforms used in production and development environments. The range includes major desktop and server operating systems as well as some embedded environments.

### Officially Supported Platforms Include:

- **Linux** (including multiple distributions and versions)
- **Mac OS X** (also iOS)
- **Windows Desktop** (including MSVC and MinGW compilers)
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD**
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **QNX**
- **DragonFly BSD**
- Other UNIX-like OSes such as GNU/Hurd, Haiku, and Android

### Not Officially Supported (but possibly buildable):

- Fuchsia (experimental)
- Windows Mobile, Windows RT (limited support)

The platform support is continuously updated in alignment with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the up-to-date platform matrix at [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## 2. Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest requires a compiler supporting at least C++17, which enables modern language features that boost stability and performance.

### Supported Compilers

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) 7.3 and above
- **Clang** 5.0 and above
- **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual C++) version 19.11 (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3) and newer
- **Intel C++ Compiler** with C++17 support
- Other compilers that conform to C++17 are generally compatible, but lack of explicit testing may arise.

### Important Points

- **C++17 compliance is mandatory.** Building GoogleTest with earlier language standards is unsupported.
- Compilers must support key features such as variadic templates, type traits, and constexpr applicable under C++17.

<Tip>
If you hit compiler errors related to language features or standard library usage, verify your compiler version and flags to ensure C++17 is enabled (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).
</Tip>

## 3. Threading and Runtime Considerations

GoogleTest detects and uses platform-specific threading APIs when available:

- Uses **pthreads** on UNIX-like systems where available.
- Uses **Windows native threading APIs** on Windows platforms.

By default, GoogleTest enables multithreading support if pthreads are available, which improves test isolation and concurrency safety. If needed, this can be overridden via build flags.

---

## 4. Platform Identification Macros

GoogleTest internally defines a rich set of macros to detect the build platform during the build process, enabling conditional compilation for platform-specific code paths. These macros are:

- `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, etc.
- Subvariants like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX_ANDROID`.

These macros are set automatically based on compiler predefined macros and do not require user intervention.

<Info>
Knowing these macros may be useful if you customize GoogleTest or add platform-specific extensions.
</Info>

---

## 5. Build Tool Compatibility

GoogleTest is designed to integrate smoothly with various popular build systems:

- **CMake**: GoogleTest provides official CMake build scripts supporting all features and making C++17 enforcement automatic. The provided scripts handle platform-specific compiler and linker flags automatically, including pthread linkage and Windows DLL exports.

- **Bazel**: GoogleTest includes Bazel build configuration files supporting major platforms and compilers. It supports platform-specific compilation flags and dependency injection (e.g., Abseil).

- **pkg-config**: GoogleTest installs `.pc` files enabling easy inclusion of compiler and linker flags in pkg-config-aware build systems.

<Tip>
To ensure successful linking and compilation, use the pkg-config files or CMake `find_package(GTest)` commands where possible. These handle platform-specific discrepancies and required flags transparently.
</Tip>

## 6. Updating and Checking Compatibility

Because platform and compiler landscapes evolve rapidly, GoogleTest maintains compatibility information in its source repository and documentation.

- Check the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) page regularly for the latest details.
- Refer to `gtest-port-arch.h` for platform detection macros.
- For compiler support, ensure you meet the minimal supported version stated above, especially enabling C++17.

<Note>
Unsupported or experimental platforms may work but are not guaranteed or officially tested. Your mileage may vary on esoteric platforms.
</Note>

## 7. Troubleshooting Platform and Compiler Issues

### Common Issues

- **Linker errors related to pthread:** On some UNIX systems, you might need to include `-pthread` explicitly if not using the CMake scripts.
- **Runtime library mismatches on Windows (MSVC):** If you see linker conflicts related to runtime libraries (e.g., `MTd` vs `MDd`), consider enabling the CMake `gtest_force_shared_crt` option.
- **Unsupported compiler version:** Modern C++ features require at least MSVC 2017 Update 3, GCC 7.3, or Clang 5.0.

### Action Steps

- Verify your compiler version and C++ standard flags.
- Use the official build scripts (`CMakeLists.txt`, Bazel files) to properly pass necessary flags.
- Consult GoogleTest's `gtest-port.h` and `gtest-port-arch.h` for insight into platform detection.

## 8. Practical Examples to Verify Environment

Compile and run a simple test to verify your platform compatibility and environment setup:

```c++
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(EnvironmentTest, BasicCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build with your compiler and linker ensuring C++17 is enabled. Successful compilation and test passing indicates supported setup.
