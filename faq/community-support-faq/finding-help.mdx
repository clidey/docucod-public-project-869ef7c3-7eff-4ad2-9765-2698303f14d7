# Where to Get More Help?

This page provides essential resources and guidance on obtaining additional support and information for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you are seeking community help, official support, or want to contribute to the project, this guide directs you to the right places and explains how to participate effectively.

## Community Forums and Chat Channels

- **GoogleTest Discussion Group**: Join the community mailing list and discussion forums where developers and users share experiences, ask questions, and provide solutions.

- **GitHub Discussions**: Use the [GoogleTest GitHub repository discussions page](https://github.com/google/googletest/discussions) to browse and participate in ongoing conversations.

- **Chat Channels**: Some unofficial chat rooms exist on platforms like Slack, Discord, or IRC where users discuss GoogleTest. Check community links on the GitHub page or related forums for details.


<Tip>
When you ask questions on forums or chat, provide clear context, your setup, what you tried, and any error messages. This helps the community assist you faster and more accurately.
</Tip>

## Official Support and Issue Filing

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs, request features, or track known problems via the [GoogleTest GitHub issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues). Before filing an issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

- **Documentation Contribution**: If you identify gaps, unclear sections, or outdated information in the docs, contributions are welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit pull requests. See the project's CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines for details.

- **Release Notes and Known Issues**: Keep informed about new features, bug fixes, and compatibility notes by reviewing the changelog and release highlights in the [Changelog section](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases).

<Note>
Be sure to follow the issue template carefully and provide minimal reproducible examples if reporting a problem. This expedites the resolution process.
</Note>

## Staying Updated

- **Watch the Repository**: Subscribing or watching the GitHub repository lets you get notified of new releases and important announcements.

- **Release Highlights**: Summaries of key updates and breaking changes help you prepare for migration and take advantage of improvements.

- **Community Blogs and External Guides**: Many users and companies maintain blogs or tutorials on GoogleTest usage and best practices. While unofficial, these resources are valuable and can be found linked from the official page or by searching online.

## How to Contribute Documentation

Documentation contributions help all users and ensure GoogleTest remains a reliable tool. Here’s how you can get involved:

1. **Identify Areas for Improvement**: While reading the documentation, note unclear explanations, missing examples, or outdated references.
2. **Fork and Edit the Docs**: GoogleTest’s docs are markdown files typically hosted in the repository. Modify them locally.
3. **Test Your Changes Locally**: If your modifications include code samples, verify they are correct and compilable.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Follow the standard GitHub workflow, describing your changes and rationale.

<Tip>
Even small improvements, such as fixing typos or clarifying terminology, are valuable contributions.
</Tip>
