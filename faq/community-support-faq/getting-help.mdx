# Getting Help & Submitting Issues

This page guides you on how to effectively obtain support, report bugs or feature requests, and contribute to the GoogleTest and GoogleMock project. It empowers you to find solutions or even become part of the community-driven improvement process.

---

## 1. Where to Get Support

When you run into questions or issues while using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, several community and official resources are available:

- **GitHub Issues**: The primary channel for reporting bugs or requesting new features. Before opening a new issue, please check if the problem has already been reported or addressed.
- **Stack Overflow**: Search and ask usage questions tagged [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`googlemock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googlemock). This is an active community where you can get help from experienced users and contributors.
- **Discussion Forums/Groups**: Some community forums and mailing lists host discussions around GoogleTest-related topics. Links to these might be found in the official repo or documentation.
- **Official Documentation**: Always refer to the [GoogleTest documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for guidance, examples, and FAQs.

<Tip>
Always search existing issues, questions, and documentation before submitting new queries to avoid duplicates and to get quicker answers.
</Tip>

## 2. How to Report Bugs or Request Features

A clear, actionable report significantly increases the chances of your issue being addressed promptly. Follow these best practices:

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check the documentation and existing issues:** Confirm the problem is not already documented or reported.
2. **Isolate the issue:** Try to reduce the problem to a minimal reproducible example. This helps maintainers understand and verify the bug.
3. **Provide detailed information:** Include your environment details (operating system, compiler version, GoogleTest version), relevant code snippets, and the full error message or unexpected behavior.
4. **Create a new issue on GitHub:** Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) and fill out the template carefully.

Example template information:

```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Code snippet or description
2. Build environment
3. Command or action

**Expected behavior**
What you expect to happen.

**Actual behavior**
What actually happens.

**Environment**
- OS:
- Compiler:
- GoogleTest version:

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
```

### Requesting Features

1. **Search for existing feature requests:** Your idea might overlap with or duplicate an existing request.
2. **Explain the motivation:** Why is this feature important or helpful?
3. **Provide use cases or examples:** Show how the feature will be used or what problems it solves.
4. **Submit your request:** Use the issue tracker with clear labeling.

<Necessary>
Providing detailed and focused tickets helps maintainers prioritize and fix issues or consider feature requests efficiently.
</Necessary>

## 3. How to Contribute

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are open source projects welcoming contributions. Here is how you can get started:

### Preparing to Contribute

- **Familiarize yourself** with the codebase by reading relevant documents such as the [Architecture Overview](../overview/architecture-core-concepts/architecture-overview.md), [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md), and [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md).
- **Check the contribution guidelines:** These are usually in the repository. Follow coding styles, commit message conventions, and testing requirements.

### Making Changes

- Fork and clone the repository.
- Create a feature branch for your work.
- Make your changes with proper tests.
- Run existing tests to check for regressions.

### Submitting Changes

- Open a pull request on GitHub.
- Provide a clear description of your changes, including motivation and tests.
- Respond to feedback from maintainers and reviewers.

<Tip>
Even if you do not plan to contribute code, you can help by commenting on issues, providing reproductions, or improving documentation.

## 5. Practical Tips for Getting Help Quickly

- When asking for help, always include the minimal code example to reproduce your issue.
- Be specific about your environment details and versions.
- Clearly state what you expected and what actually happened.
- When reporting bugs, avoid posting huge logs. Trim to the essential parts.
- Engage politely and be patient — maintainers and community members are often volunteers.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Support Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Support Topics">
<Accordion title="Installation Issues">
Most installation problems arise from missing prerequisites or incompatibility with compilers or platforms. Validate your environment against the [system requirements](../getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.md) and follow installation guides closely.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker and Build Errors">
Check that your build system is correctly linking GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries. Refer to the integration [build system guides](../overview/workflow-integration/integration-build-systems.md) for CMake or Bazel. Also, verify compiler settings and C++ standard compliance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mocking Unexpected Behavior">
If mocks are not acting as expected (e.g., real methods are called instead of mocked), ensure methods are declared `virtual` in your interfaces, and the mocks are set up before exercise. Read the [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md) for proper usage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Verbose Logging for Debugging">
Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to increase verbosity and trace mock calls, helping diagnose complex issues in expectations or behaviors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Getting Official Help

If you cannot find a solution after exhausting community resources, consider:

- Reporting detailed issues on the [GitHub tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- Submitting patches or test cases to illustrate your problem.
- Seeking guidance through organizational support channels if available.
