# Performance: Optimizing Test Suite Execution

Optimizing the execution time and performance of your test suite is essential for rapid development cycles and continuous integration efficiency. This guide explores practical strategies and configuration options to minimize test runtime, manage costly setup, and effectively use parameterized testing.

---

## 1. Running Tests in Parallel

GoogleTest supports running tests in parallel using multiple threads or processes, significantly reducing total test time, especially for large test suites.

### How to Enable Parallel Test Execution

- Use the **`--gtest_parallel`** flag with test runners or configure your build system (like Bazel or CMake) to run tests concurrently.
- Tests should be designed to be *thread-safe* and *isolated* to benefit fully from parallel execution.

### Best Practices

- Avoid shared static or global state between tests.
- Use test fixtures with proper setup/teardown to isolate test environments.
- Validate that resources like files or databases are not contended by parallel tests.

### Example: Running Tests with Bazel

```bash
bazel test --jobs=8 //your/test:target
```

This command runs tests with up to 8 concurrent jobs.

<Tip>
When enabling parallelism, also monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) to avoid system overload that may ironically slow down tests.
</Tip>

## 2. Handling Costly or Expensive Setup

Setting up resources (database connections, networks, large fixtures) can significantly slow down tests.

### Strategies to Mitigate Costly Setup

- **Shared Setup:** Use test fixtures with `SetUpTestSuite` method (static setup) to share expensive initialization across tests within the same suite.

- **Test Fixtures:** Organize tests requiring the same heavy setup into a test fixture to avoid repeating setup per test case.

- **Mock External Dependencies:** Use mocks (via GoogleMock) to isolate your tests from slow or non-deterministic dependencies like network or disk.

### Example: Shared Test Fixture Setup
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Expensive setup here, executed once per test suite
    db_connection = ConnectToDatabase();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    DisconnectDatabase(db_connection);
  }

  static DatabaseConnection* db_connection;
};
```

### Tips

- Avoid expensive setup/teardown in individual tests if possible.
- Consider fakes or mocks for dependencies that are costly and nondeterministic.

## 3. Using Value-Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests Efficiently

Parameterized tests allow running the same test logic with different input values or types, improving coverage.

### Efficient Use

- Use parameterization to reduce code duplication and cover variations succinctly.
- Avoid overly large parameter sets that drastically increase test runtime.
- Group related parameter sets logically to keep test runs manageable.

### Example: Value-Parameterized Test

```cpp
class PrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(PrimeTest, IsPrime) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PrimeTests, PrimeTest,
                         ::testing::Values(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13));
```

### Tips

- If some parameter cases are slower, consider marking them as `DISABLED_` or isolate them.
- Combine parameterized tests with parallel execution to reduce total runtime.

## 4. Profiling and Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

Understanding which tests take the longest allows targeted optimization.

### How to Profile

- Use GoogleTest's `--gtest_repeat` and timing logs for suspicious tests.
- Implement custom timing within test fixtures or test bodies.
- Analyze logs from CI to identify slow tests.

### Optimization Steps

- Refactor slow tests to reduce dependencies or complexity.
- Replace real dependencies with mocks or fakes.
- Parallelize slow tests where possible.

## 5. Mitigating Slow Builds Due to Mocks

Mock classes generated by GoogleMock can cause longer compile times.

### Tips to Minimize Impact

- Define mock class constructors and destructors out-of-line in .cc files to reduce inline compilation.
- Limit the number of mock methods per class.
- Reduce template and macro complexity where feasible.

### Example

```cpp
// mock_foo.h
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MockFoo();
  ~MockFoo();
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
};

// mock_foo.cc
#include "mock_foo.h"
MockFoo::MockFoo() {}
MockFoo::~MockFoo() {}
```

This reduces compilation overhead when including the header.

## 6. Tips for Running Tests with Large Test Suites

- **Split tests into smaller targets** in your build system to allow parallel execution and selective testing.
- **Use test filters** to run relevant subsets during development.
- Take advantage of **test sharding or splitting** techniques in CI.

## 7. Monitoring and Reporting

- Use `--gtest_output` flag to generate XML or JSON reports for CI systems.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` in debugging to stop at the first failure.
- Control verbosity with `--gtest_verbose` and `--gmock_verbose`.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

### Common Issues

- Tests not designed for parallel execution (shared state/conflicts).
- Excessive mocking or overly tight expectations leading to test overhead.
- Large fixtures or datasets loaded per test unnecessarily.

### Solutions

- Review and refactor tests for isolation.
- Use `NiceMock` or `NaggyMock` to prevent excessive verification overhead.
- Cache expensive setup where safe.
