# How Can I Contribute or Find Community-Developed Tools?

GoogleTest thrives not only on the solid foundation laid by its core maintainers but also through a vibrant community of contributors and users who extend its capabilities. Whether you want to contribute code, improve documentation, or leverage enhanced tools designed by fellow users, understanding the contribution process and community resources is essential to harnessing the full power of GoogleTest.

## 1. Contribution Guidelines

Contributing to GoogleTest means joining a collaborative effort to improve testing, documentation, and tooling that benefit developers worldwide. Your efforts can span coding new features, refining documentation, fixing bugs, or developing tests and extensions that make GoogleTest more robust and accessible.

### Getting Started with Contributions

- **Understand the Scope:** Contributions can range from source code, test cases, and documentation to community tools like GUIs, adapters, and listeners.
- **Read the Guidelines:** The project has a dedicated [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file outlining how to propose changes, coding standards, and the submission process.
- **Use GitHub Workflow:** Fork the repository, create feature branches, commit your changes with clear messages, and submit pull requests for review.
- **Engage with Reviews:** Act on reviewer feedback promptly and clearly to get your contributions merged.

### Areas Where Your Contributions Matter

- **Code Enhancements:** Performance improvements, new test macros, bug fixes.
- **Documentation:** Tutorials, FAQs, usage guides, and examples that make it easier for new and existing users.
- **Testing:** Additional test cases to improve coverage and reliability.
- **Community Tools:** Development or refinement of community-driven helpers, such as GUI-based test runners or output listeners.

## 2. Community-Developed Tools and Extensions

The GoogleTest ecosystem is enriched by tools created by users that address common needs like test integration, visualization, and performance.

### Notable Community Tools

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Test Runners:**
  - *GTest Runner* ([gtest-runner](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner)) offers a Qt5-based cross-platform interface for running and visualizing test results with ease.
  - *GoogleTest UI* ([gtest-gbar](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar)) provides a test runner with a progress bar and interactive failure list.

- **Test Output Integration:**
  - *GTest TAP Listener* ([gtest-tap-listener](https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener)) implements the Test Anything Protocol (TAP) for outputting test results, enabling smooth integration with TAP-compatible test runners.

- **Parallel Running and Adapters:**
  - *gtest-parallel* is a tool for running tests concurrently, significantly speeding up test execution.
  - *GoogleTest Adapter* and *C++ TestMate* are Visual Studio Code extensions to browse, run, and debug GoogleTest tests directly inside your IDE.

- **Test Generation Tools:**
  - *Cornichon* is a small Gherkin DSL parser that generates starter GoogleTest code, bridging behavior-driven development with C++ testing.

### Finding and Using Community Tools

- Visit the [GoogleTest README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md) to discover a curated list of community-supported tools.
- Explore community-created documentation and resources for deeper insights and usage tips.
