# Assertions and Matcher Issues FAQ

This FAQ page addresses common questions and challenges users encounter with GoogleTest assertions and GoogleMock matchers. It helps clarify how to interpret failure messages, avoid pitfalls with assertions, and effectively write expressive and maintainable test conditions using matchers.

---

### 1. What causes typical assertion failures in GoogleTest?

Assertion failures occur when the condition verified by an `EXPECT_` or `ASSERT_` macro is not met. For example, using `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` fails if `val1 != val2`.

Common reasons include:
- Mismatched values or unexpected results
- Invalid pointer usage in string assertions
- Floating-point comparisons failing due to precision differences
- Using incompatible types in comparisons

Failure messages describe the expected and actual values, guiding you to the mismatch.

### 2. How can I interpret failure messages to quickly find the problem?

- **Value Expressions:** Messages show both the expressions and their evaluated values.
- **Difference Diffs:** For string equality failures such as `EXPECT_EQ`, GoogleTest shows a diff highlighting mismatched characters.
- **Stack Traces:** If enabled, stack traces pinpoint where the failure occurred.
- **Additional Notes:** Custom messages streamed using `<<` appear below, providing context.

Look for lines starting with `Expected:` and `Actual:` to identify mismatches.

### 3. What are common confusions or mistakes when using matchers?

- Using `EXPECT_EQ` for C strings compares pointer addresses, not content; instead, use `EXPECT_STREQ`.
- Matchers must be *pure functions* without side effects â€” do not call mock methods inside matchers.
- Using wrong matcher types for function arguments causes compile-time errors; use `SafeMatcherCast` if you know what you are doing.
- Overloaded methods require explicit matcher type disambiguation.

### 4. Why do some matchers produce unclear messages, and how can I improve them?

Some predicates or matchers that only return `bool` might give generic failure messages.

**Solutions:**
- Use predicate functions returning `AssertionResult` with detailed messages.
- Use custom predicate-formatters (`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`) for fine-grained messages.
- Use the built-in GoogleMock matchers, which provide rich explanations.

Example predicate with an explanatory message:
```cpp
AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return AssertionSuccess() << n << " is even";
  else
    return AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}
```

### 5. How do I handle floating-point comparison assertion failures?

Floating-point imprecision often causes direct equality to fail.

Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` to check approximate equality using ULPs.

For checks within a specific tolerance, use `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)`.

If you get failure messages suggesting the difference exceeds the bound, verify your tolerance and use these specialized macros instead of plain `EXPECT_EQ`.

### 6. How to compare strings correctly?

Avoid using `EXPECT_EQ` on C strings, which compares addresses. Instead, use:
- `EXPECT_STREQ` for case-sensitive comparisons
- `EXPECT_STRNE` for inequality
- `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ` and `EXPECT_STRCASENE` to ignore case

Examples:
```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ("hello", c_str_pointer);
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ("Foo", "foo");
```

The failure messages will show UTF-8 translations for wide strings.

### 7. Why do I get "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings?

This warning appears when a mock method is called but has no matching `EXPECT_CALL` expectations.

**Recommendations:**
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors when calls are uninteresting.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting call warnings.
- If certain calls are allowed but uninteresting, add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.
- Avoid adding `EXPECT_CALL` just to silence a warning unless you want to verify the call.

### 8. How can I write expressive matcher conditions to avoid fragile tests?

- Use matchers like `_` to match any argument when you don't care about a particular parameter.
- Combine matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`, and container matchers like `ElementsAre()`.
- Use `Field()` and `Property()` to check object members or getter results.
- Use `Pointee()` to validate pointed-to values via pointers.

### 9. How do I disambiguate overloaded mock methods?

- Use the helper `Const()` to select const vs non-const overloads.
- Use explicit matcher types via `Matcher<Type>(...)` or `TypedEq<Type>(...)`.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetBar())   // non-const method
EXPECT_CALL(Const(mock), GetBar())  // const method
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Print(Matcher<int>(Lt(5))));
```

### 10. Why does `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` not abort the function on failure?

They only detect if the statement generated new fatal failures in the current thread, but they do not abort control flow. Remember fatal failures abort only the current function.

Use `HasFatalFailure()` after calling subroutines that might contain `ASSERT_*` to exit early when a fatal failure occurs.

### 11. How do I catch and verify failures emitted deep inside utility code?

Use the macros `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` or `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)`, included by `#include <gtest/gtest-spi.h>`, to assert failures generated by `statement`.

Limitations:
- Only catches failures on the current thread (except `_ON_ALL_THREADS` variants).
- The statement cannot return a value or reference local variables in some cases.

### 12. How do I control how much information GoogleMock prints?

The `--gmock_verbose` flag controls verbosity:
- `info` for all informational messages and warnings (includes stack traces)
- `warning` for warnings and errors (default, no stack traces)
- `error` for errors only

Set via command line `--gmock_verbose=info` or programmatically:
```cpp
::testing::FLAGS_gmock_verbose = "error";
```

Stack trace depth is controlled via `--gtest_stack_trace_depth`.

### 13. Why does using `Return` with move-only types in actions sometimes fail?

The `Return(x)` action copies the value `x` at time of action creation, which doesn't work with move-only types like `std::unique_ptr`. The solution is:
- Use a lambda or `Invoke` action that constructs and returns the move-only type when the mock method is invoked.
- For example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, MakeBuzz(_))
  .WillRepeatedly([](StringPiece) {
    return std::make_unique<Buzz>(AccessLevel::kInternal);
  });
```

### 14. How do I customize failure messages for matchers?

- Use `MATCHER` or `MATCHER_P` macros to create custom matchers with descriptive failure messages.
- Use the `result_listener` inside matcher to stream additional failure explanation.
- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` macros with predicate-formatters for full control.

Example:
```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleBy, divisor, "") {
  if (arg % divisor == 0) return true;
  *result_listener << "remainder is " << (arg % divisor);
  return false;
}
```

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Assertion and Matcher Issues">
<Accordion title="Why does EXPECT_EQ fail to compare C strings correctly?">
GoogleTest's `EXPECT_EQ` performs pointer comparison for C strings (e.g., `const char*`), not content comparison. To compare C string *contents*, use `EXPECT_STREQ` and related macros like `EXPECT_STRNE`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I get detailed messages when using predicate assertions?">
Use predicate functions that return `AssertionResult` instead of `bool`. This lets you provide descriptive messages for both success and failure cases. Additionally, predicate-formatters used with `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` give full control over messages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do floating-point assertions sometimes fail unexpectedly?">
Floating-point math can cause tiny differences. Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR` to compare with appropriate tolerance instead of direct equality which is sensitive to rounding errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to prevent 'Uninteresting mock function call' warnings in GoogleMock?">
Uninteresting calls occur when a mock method is called without any matching `EXPECT_CALL`. Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior, or employ `NiceMock` to suppress warnings. Alternatively, add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to allow all calls explicitly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I handle overloaded methods in mock classes?">
Disambiguate calls using the `Const()` wrapper for const overloads, or specify matcher types explicitly via `Matcher<Type>(...)` or `TypedEq<Type>(...)` to guide the compiler.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are some best practices for composing matchers?">
Use built-in matchers like `_`, `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` for combining conditions. Use `Field()` and `Property()` to check class members or method results. Use `Pointee()` to match the value pointed to by a pointer.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I interpret GoogleTest failure messages effectively?">
Look for expected vs actual values, relevant diff outputs, and any custom messages. Enabling verbose output or stack traces (`--gtest_stack_trace_depth`) can aid in locating failure origins.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I test code that throws exceptions properly?">
Use the exception assertion macros like `EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`, and `EXPECT_NO_THROW`. Failure messages will indicate the mismatch between expected and actual exceptions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="When and how should I use soft (EXPECT) vs fatal (ASSERT) assertions?">
Use `EXPECT_*` if you want the test to continue after failure. Use `ASSERT_*` when failure should abort the current function immediately. Note fatal assertions abort only the enclosing function, not the whole test by default.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I check that a function call fails as expected in unit tests?">
Use the macros `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE`, `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` (available in `gtest-spi.h`) to verify that some code triggers the expected failures within the current thread.

### Practical Tips

- Stream custom failure messages into assertions with `<<` for richer debugging info.
- Wrap complex predicates in matchers or predicate-formatters for precise failure explanations.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information to failures occurring in subroutines.
- When mocking, prefer to define expectations that reflect contract rather than internal call sequences to avoid brittle tests.
- Limit verbose logging in GoogleMock with the `--gmock_verbose` flag.
