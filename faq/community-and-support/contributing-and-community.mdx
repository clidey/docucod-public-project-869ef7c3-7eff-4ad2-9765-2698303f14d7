## Getting Involved: Contribution Opportunities

GoogleTest thrives thanks to an active community of users and contributors. There are several ways you can contribute:

### 1. Contribute Code

- **Fix bugs and add features:** You can improve GoogleTest by fixing bugs, adding new test features, or enhancing existing functionality.
- **Follow the contributing guide:** To ensure your contributions fit well with the project structure and quality standards, start by reading the official [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository.
- **Submit pull requests:** Fork the codebase, implement your changes, and submit pull requests for review.

<Tip>
When you contribute code, follow GoogleTest’s code style, write clear commit messages, and include tests to verify your improvements.
</Tip>

### 2. Improve Documentation

- GoogleTest documentation is open and welcomes improvements.
- You can help fix typos, clarify explanations, update outdated info, or add new tutorials.
- Make edits directly on GitHub or submit suggestions via pull requests.

<Tip>
Improving documentation helps new users onboard faster and enhances everyone’s understanding of GoogleTest features.

### 3. Provide Community-Created Documentation

- Share your own tutorials, guides, or insights that go beyond the official docs.
- Submit links or samples that others can learn from.
- Some community-created documentation is already curated and linked from the official docs.
