# FAQ: Optimizing Test Performance and Scalability

This FAQ addresses common questions and solutions about improving test execution speed, managing large test suites, and optimizing mock usage in GoogleTest & GoogleMock. It guides users toward faster, more maintainable, and scalable test practices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I reduce the execution time of my unit tests?

- **Use mock objects to reduce dependencies:** Replace slow or unreliable components (e.g., databases, network calls) with mocks to isolate your tests and avoid expensive operations.
- **Set expectations only when necessary:** Avoid over-specifying calls with extra expectations that aren't crucial, which can slow down test execution and increase maintenance.
- **Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors:** Use `ON_CALL` to define default mock actions without enforcing expectations, reducing overhead.
- **Run tests in parallel:** Use your build system or test runner to parallelize execution where possible.

### How do I manage large test suites without excessive compile times?

- **Move mock class constructors and destructors to `.cc` files:** Defining the constructor and destructor outside the header prevents repeated compilation of complex mock methods.
- **Limit the number of distinct mock types per test binary:** Minimize mock diversity in one test file, split mocks across different files or libraries.
- **Use type aliases and parentheses around complex MOCK_METHOD types:** This avoids parsing ambiguities that can slow down compilation.

### What are common performance pitfalls when using mocks?

- **Overusing strict expectations:** Writing too many strict `.Times()` or `.InSequence()` constraints can lead to brittle tests and slower matching.
- **Not retiring expectations when appropriate:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations expected to be called a limited number of times to avoid unnecessary overhead.
- **Setting many `WillOnce` actions without proper sequences:** Excess `WillOnce` without appropriate ordering can cause unexpected failures and hamper test speed.
- **Excessive use of matchers with complex logic:** Simplify or minimize matcher complexity to improve runtime matching performance.

### How do I optimize mock usage for faster tests?

- **Use `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting call warnings:** This reduces log noise and overhead during test runs.
- **Apply reusable matchers and actions:** Assign complex matchers or actions to variables to prevent redundant construction.
- **Delegate default mock behavior via `ON_CALL`:** Define broad default actions to avoid frequent, costly reconfigurations for each test.
- **Avoid mocking non-virtual functions unless necessary:** Prefer interfaces and virtual functions to keep mocks lean and simple.

### How can I troubleshoot tests that run slowly due to mocks?

- Enable `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock function calls and understand expectation matching overhead.
- Profile your tests to identify slow mocks and refine their usage.
- Avoid unexpected calls that trigger default actions repeatedly.
- Check for excessive or redundant expectations that may cause overhead.

## Common Issues & Gotchas

### Compilation Takes Too Long When Using Mocks

- Mock class constructors and destructors, generated from `MOCK_METHOD` macros, are often the biggest source of compile-time overhead.
- Define these constructors and destructors separately in `.cc` files to speed up compilation.
- Use type aliases and parentheses for complex types in `MOCK_METHOD` to avoid macro parsing slowdowns.

### Tests Fail or Run Slowly Due to Excessive or Missing Expectations

- Avoid over-constraining mocks with too many `.Times()`, `.InSequence()`, or overly specific matchers.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations as soon as their upper bound is reached.
- Use `NiceMock` if you do not want to enforce expectations on less critical mock calls.

### Unexpected or Uninteresting Calls Impact Test Feedback and Performance

- `NaggyMock` prints warnings on uninteresting calls, which may slow down tests.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress these warnings when not critical.
- Explicitly expect or disallow calls with `EXPECT_CALL` and `.Times(0)`.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Prefer placeholder matchers (`_`) when argument values don't matter** to avoid over-specifying expectations.
- **Use sequences and partial orders judiciously**: only when call order matters to your testâ€™s intent.
- **Leverage `ON_CALL` for broad default behaviors and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying key interactions.**
- **Reuse matchers and actions across tests to reduce runtime overhead and improve readability.**
- **Inline or delegate mocks with fakes or real objects carefully to optimize test time.**
- **Profile and monitor test suite execution time regularly, especially before major refactors or additions.**

## Troubleshooting Procedures

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Performance Problems">
<Accordion title="Slow Compilation due to Mocks">
- Move mock class constructor/destructor to source files.
- Use type aliases or parentheses in `MOCK_METHOD` macro parameters.
- Reduce the number and complexity of mock methods per mock class.
- Split large mock classes.
- Use precompiled headers where possible.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Runs Too Slow or Hang due to Mock Calls">
- Run with `--gmock_verbose=info` to analyze mock call overhead.
- Avoid over-restrictive or unnecessary `.InSequence()` and `.Times()` constraints.
- Use `NiceMock` to reduce warnings.
- Look for unexpected calls due to missing or wrong expectations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Failure Due to Exhausted WillOnce Actions">
- Either add a `.WillRepeatedly()` action.
- Or set the number of `WillOnce()` clauses equal to `.Times()`.
- Use sequences to specify expected call order properly.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` if appropriate.
