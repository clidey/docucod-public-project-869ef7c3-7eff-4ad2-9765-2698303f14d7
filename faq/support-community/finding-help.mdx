# Where to Find Help

This page directs users to official documentation, community forums, and issue trackers for support with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It provides guidance to help you find effective resources for resolving complex or unresolved questions.

---

## Official Documentation

The first place to look for help and detailed guidance is the official documentation. It includes comprehensive guides, API references, tutorials, and FAQs designed to answer most user questions:

- **GoogleTest Primer**: Learn the essentials of writing and running tests using GoogleTest.
- **Mocking Reference**: Understand how to define and use mocks with GoogleMock.
- **gMock Cookbook**: Find practical recipes and examples for advanced mocking techniques.
- **Assertions Reference**: Detailed list of assertion macros with usage examples.
- **Matchers Reference**: Reference for matchers to specify argument expectations in mocks.
- **Mocking APIs**: Reference for mock method definitions, call expectations, and actions.
- **FAQ Sections**: Answers to common questions and troubleshooting tips.

You can find these resources linked from the official [GoogleTest documentation website](https://google.github.io/googletest) or browse the Markdown files in the repository under the `/docs` directory.

## Community Resources

If your problem requires further assistance, the GoogleTest community offers various avenues for support:

- **GitHub Issues**: For bug reports, feature requests, and implementation questions, open an issue at the [googletest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues). Please provide a clear description, minimal reproducible example, and environment details.

- **Stack Overflow**: Ask specific usage or debugging questions tagged with `googletest` or `gmock`. This is useful for questions about test writing, assertion usage, mocking patterns, and error troubleshooting.

- **Mailing Lists and Forums**: While not officially maintained, some developers share knowledge via mailing lists or related forums. Check for active groups linked from the GoogleTest documentation or GitHub wiki.

- **Community Examples and Tutorials**: Many open-source projects and blog posts provide examples of GoogleTest and GoogleMock in real scenarios. Searching for these can clarify usage patterns and best practices.

## Best Practices for Getting Help

To get effective assistance quickly, keep the following in mind when seeking help:

- **Provide Context**: Include the version of GoogleTest/gMock, your compiler and platform, and how you built the project.
- **Minimal Reproducible Example**: Strip your code down to the smallest version that reproduces the problem. This makes debugging easier.
- **Describe Expectations vs Actual Behavior**: Clearly state what you expect to happen and what is actually happening, including error messages or test failures.
- **Search Before Asking**: Many questions have been answered; searching issue trackers and forums can save time.

## Getting More Help

If you encounter complex issues or bugs that are hard to resolve:

- Review the [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md) and [gMock Cookbook](guides/mocking-best-practices/mocking-workflow.md) to ensure correct usage.
- Increase verbosity by using command-line flags [`--gmock_verbose=info`](reference/mocking-apis/mock-actions.md#flags) to get detailed logs.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to force verification and catch errors earlier.
- Check the [FAQ](faq/general-usage-issues/common-errors.md) for common issues and fixes.

If all else fails, open a detailed issue on GitHub or ask a question on Stack Overflow with the information described above.
