# Support Resources & Reporting Issues

This page guides you on where and how to seek help for complex problems, report bugs, or contribute to improving the GoogleTest and GoogleMock project. It provides direct links to official support channels and essential guidelines to submit clear, high-quality issues.

## 1. Where to Get Help

GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer multiple avenues for assistance when you encounter complex problems or need guidance beyond the documentation.

### Official Support Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: The primary channel for bug reports and feature requests. Please search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
  - Link: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

- **GoogleGroups Discussion Forum**: For asking questions, sharing ideas, and discussing best practices with the community.
  - Link: [https://groups.google.com/g/googletestframework](https://groups.google.com/g/googletestframework)

- **Stack Overflow**: Use tags like `googletest` and `googlemock` to ask questions or find answers from the wider developer community.
  - Link: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest)

### Community-Created Documentation

- GoogleTest community members have created insightful guides and tutorials.
- See [Community-Created Documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/community_created_documentation.md) for curated links such as "Googlemock Insights" by ElectricRCAircraftGuy.

## 2. How to Report Issues Effectively

Submitting a clear and actionable issue accelerates problem resolution and improves the quality of the project. Follow these guidelines:

### Essential Information to Include

- **Environment Details**:
  - Operating system and version
  - Compiler name and version
  - GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions used

- **Build Details**:
  - Build system and configuration (e.g., CMake, Bazel)
  - Flags or special options enabled during build

- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  - Provide minimal, reproducible code example or test case
  - Detail commands used to build and run the test

- **Observed Behavior**:
  - Describe what actually happens
  - Include error messages or logs verbatim

- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Describe what you expected to happen

- **Additional Context**:
  - Any recent changes, special setups, or relevant dependencies

### Best Practices

- Search existing issues before reporting to avoid duplicates.
- Keep the report focused and concise.
- Provide code snippets as markdown-formatted blocks to preserve formatting.
- Use clear, descriptive titles.
- If possible, enable verbose logging using `--gmock_verbose=info` and attach the output.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Reporting issues without reproduction steps.
- Lack of environment or version information.
- Posting lengthy logs without context or highlighting the problem.
- Reporting known limitations as bugs (see [Legacy gMock FAQ](gmock_faq.md) for known issues).

## 3. Contributing to the Project

The GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects welcome contributions including bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation improvements.

### How to Contribute

- Fork the repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Follow the project's coding standards and commit message guidelines.
- Run all tests locally before submitting a pull request.
- Provide clear descriptions and testing steps with your pull request.
- Engage in code review discussions constructively.

### Resources for Contributors

- Explore the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidelines.
- Read the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and [gMock Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md) to understand design and testing philosophy.

## 4. Additional Support Tips

### Debugging Assistance

- Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed mock call traces.
- Use the stack trace depth flag `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=N` to control log verbosity.

### Avoid Common Mistakes

- Verify that your mocks are set with `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` correctly as per mock usage guidelines.
- Remember that mocks verify expectations on destruction; if mocks are leaking, expectations may not be checked.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if you must verify expectations before destruction.
