# How Can I Contribute or Report Issues?

Welcome to the GoogleTest and GoogleMock contribution and issue reporting guide. Whether you have discovered a bug, want to suggest a new feature, or are interested in contributing code or documentation improvements, this page will guide you through the proper channels and best practices to ensure your participation is constructive and effective.

## Reporting Issues

Clear and detailed issue reports help the community and maintainers resolve problems faster.

### What to Report

- Bugs or unexpected behavior in GoogleTest or GoogleMock.
- Build or installation problems.
- Documentation errors or gaps.
- Feature requests or enhancement ideas.

### Preparing Your Report

Before filing an issue:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Make sure the issue has not already been reported or addressed by reviewing the GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
2. **Collect Environment Details:** Include OS, compiler version, GoogleTest/GoogleMock version (or commit SHA), and build system details.
3. **Reproduce the Problem:** Provide a minimal, complete, and verifiable example demonstrating the issue.
4. **Describe Expected vs. Actual Behavior:** Explain what you expected to happen and what actually occurred.

### How to Report

Use the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) on the GoogleTest repository adhering to these guidelines:

- Provide a descriptive title.
- Use Markdown formatting for clarity.
- Add labels, where appropriate, if you have permission.

### Example Issue Template

```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Clone the repo
2. Build the project with CMake
3. Run test `X`

**Expected behavior**
What you expected to happen.

**Actual behavior**
What actually happened.

**Environment:**

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests help shape GoogleTest’s future development.

- Clearly describe the feature and its benefit.
- Include a use case illustrating how it improves testing.
- Avoid vague requests; be specific and actionable.
- Consider whether the feature fits within GoogleTest’s goals.

If possible, discuss your idea in GitHub discussions or forums before drafting a formal proposal.

## Contributing Code or Documentation

GoogleTest welcomes contributions that improve the product.

### Before You Start

- Familiarize yourself with the project’s structure and contribution guidelines.
- Ensure your development environment supports C++17 and you can build the project using CMake.
- Follow the coding style and best practices established in the codebase.

### Typical Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository:** Use your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Topic Branch:** Keep changes focused and isolated.
3. **Make Changes:** Implement your feature or fix.
4. **Write Tests:** Add or update tests to cover your changes.
5. **Build and Test:** Verify that your changes build correctly and all tests pass.
6. **Commit Changes:** Use clear, concise commit messages.
7. **Submit a Pull Request:** Target the `main` branch and provide a detailed description of your changes.

### Pull Request Best Practices

- Explain the motivation and context.
- Reference related issues or pull requests.
- Keep changes atomic and well-scoped.
- Run continuous integration checks and address feedback.

### Building and Testing Links

Refer to the main build instructions in the [googletest README](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md) for detailed setup and build guidance using CMake.

Example standalone build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
dcd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test  # or ctest
```

To incorporate into your project’s CMake build, use the `FetchContent` approach shown:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main gmock_main)
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

### Style and Code Quality

- Use consistent indentation and naming per Google C++ Style Guide.
- Avoid warnings and keep code clean.
- Document new public APIs and features.

### Testing Your Changes

Run tests with `make test` or `ctest`. Contribute new tests for bugs fixed or features added.
