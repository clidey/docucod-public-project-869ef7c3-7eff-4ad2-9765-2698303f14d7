## How to Provide Feedback or Report Issues

The GoogleTest project welcomes input from users and contributors in several ways:

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- **Where to report:** Use the GitHub repository's [Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) page to submit new bug reports or feature requests.
- **Before submitting:** Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- **What to include in reports:**
  - A clear description of the problem or feature.
  - Reproducible steps or code snippets.
  - Expected vs actual behavior.
  - Environment details including platform, compiler, and GoogleTest version.

### Guidelines for Writing Effective Issues

Providing actionable and clear reports speeds up triage and resolution. Include:

- Minimal, complete, and verifiable examples.
- Clear error messages or stack traces.

## Making Code Contributions

### Contribution Process

GoogleTest follows standard open source contribution practices:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the repository for your changes.
2. **Create a Branch:** Use a feature branch for your work.
3. **Implement Changes:** Follow the project's coding style, adding tests and documentation as appropriate.
4. **Test Your Changes:** Verify your code with existing and new tests.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR to the main repository, describing your changes clearly.

### Best Practices

- Review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidance on coding standards, commit messages, tests, and licensing.
- Include tests that cover your changes.
- Keep your commits focused and descriptive.
- Run existing test suites locally before submission to ensure stability.

### Reviewing and Merging

- Contributions are reviewed by maintainers.
- Feedback may be provided for improvements.
- Once accepted, the PR will be merged following the project's review policies.

## Example: Opening a Bug Report

```markdown
Title: "Failing EXPECT_EQ in Multithreaded Environment on Windows"

Description:
I'm encountering an intermittent failure with `EXPECT_EQ` on Windows when tests run concurrently. The failure occurs randomly under high load.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build GoogleTest on Windows with Visual Studio 2019.
2. Run the provided multithreaded test example from `samples/sample1_unittest.cc`.

Expected Behavior:
Tests pass consistently.

Actual Behavior:
`EXPECT_EQ` sometimes fails with mismatched values reported.

Environment:
- GoogleTest version: v1.17.0
- OS: Windows 10
- Compiler: MSVC 2019

Any suggestions or fixes would be appreciated.
