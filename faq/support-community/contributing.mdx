# How Can I Contribute or Report Problems?

Contributing to GoogleTest is a vital part of keeping the framework robust, up-to-date, and valuable to the community. Whether you want to file a bug report, suggest improvements, contribute documentation, or submit code, this guide will walk you through the appropriate paths and best practices to ensure your contributions are effective, well-received, and aligned with project standards.

## Reporting Bugs

### When to Report a Bug

- You have identified a reproducible problem or incorrect behavior in GoogleTest or GoogleMock.
- You have encountered build or runtime errors, crashes, or flaky tests not caused by your code.
- The documentation is incorrect or misleading about a particular feature.

### How to File a Bug Report

- **Search Existing Issues**: Before filing, search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to avoid duplicates.
- **Include a Clear Title**: Summarize the problem succinctly.
- **Provide a Minimal Reproducible Example**: Share code that triggers the issue, including platform details and GoogleTest version.
- **Describe Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: Clearly state what you expect and what you got instead.
- **Attach Logs and Error Messages**: Include build output, test output, and any relevant error traces.

### Best Practices for Bug Reports

- Be concise but thorough.
- Use code formatting for all code snippets.
- Provide environment details: OS, compiler version, and build system.

<Tip>
Providing a minimal reproducible example expedites debugging and leads to faster resolutions.

## Example: Submitting a Bug Report

```markdown
Title: GoogleTest crashes when running on macOS 11 with clang 12

Description:
When running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` on macOS 11 using clang 12, GoogleTest crashes during test suite teardown. This behavior started after upgrading from GoogleTest version 1.10.0 to 1.11.0.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Build GoogleTest with clang 12.
3. Run the following simple test program:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, AlwaysPasses) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Expected:
Tests run and exit cleanly.

Actual:
Crash with stack trace indicating memory access violation.

Environment:
- OS: macOS 11.2
- Compiler: clang 12
- GoogleTest version: 1.11.0

Attached logs and stack trace included.
```
