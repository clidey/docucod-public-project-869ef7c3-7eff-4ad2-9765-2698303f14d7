# Where Can I Get More Help or Report Bugs?

Navigating challenges while using GoogleTest and GoogleMock is an expected part of the development journey. This page guides you through the primary avenues for obtaining assistance and reporting issues effectively, ensuring your experience with the framework remains smooth and productive.

---

## Primary Support Venues

### Official Documentation Portal

Before seeking external help, consult the extensive [GoogleTest Documentation Portal](https://google.github.io/googletest/) which offers comprehensive guides, tutorials, examples, and API references. Exploring these resources often answers common questions quickly and thoroughly.

### GitHub Issues

For bugs, feature requests, or unexpected behavior, [GoogleTest’s GitHub repository issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) is the ideal channel:

- Make sure to check existing issues before filing a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Provide detailed information including exact steps to reproduce, environment details (OS, compiler version, GoogleTest version), code snippets or minimal reproducible examples.

### Discussion Boards and Community Forums

Engage with the GoogleTest community via:

- [GoogleTest Discussion on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/googletest/discussions) for broader questions and feature discussions.
- Stack Overflow with the [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) and [`gmock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gmock) tags for community-driven support and solutions.

### Mailing Lists and Chat Channels

While no official mailing list exists, many developers in the community connect through C++ or testing-related mailing lists and chat groups (such as relevant Slack or Discord servers). Links to community resources are often found in the documentation and GitHub repository README files.

## Writing Effective Help and Bug Reports

When requesting help or reporting bugs, clear communication accelerates resolution. Here are recommended best practices to ensure your requests are actionable and precise:

### 1. Clearly Define Your Environment

Provide details about your system:

- Operating system and version
- Compiler type and version
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions
- Build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel) and relevant configuration

### 2. Describe the Problem Precisely

Explain what you expected versus what happened. Include:

- The exact error message or failure symptoms
- Scenario or workflow leading to the problem
- Whether the issue is reproducible or intermittent

### 3. Provide Minimal Reproducible Examples

Share the smallest amount of code or configuration that reproduces the problem. This helps maintainers and community members understand your issue quickly and test fixes efficiently.

### 4. Include Logs and Output

Attach test run output, compiler messages, and any relevant logs. If using tooling flags (such as `--gmock_verbose`), include those outputs to showcase detailed behavior.

### 5. Reference Related Documentation

Link to or cite related documentation pages you have already reviewed. This shows thoroughness and helps avoid redundant suggestions.

## Additional Tips

- Use descriptive titles for GitHub issues.
- Avoid vague statements like "Does not work" or "Fails sometimes."
- Stay courteous and patient in community discussions.
- When reporting a bug, specify if you’ve attempted any workarounds.
