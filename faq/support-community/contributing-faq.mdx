# Contributing & Feedback

Welcome to the contribution and feedback hub for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page answers common questions about how you can contribute code, report bugs, and help improve documentation for better community collaboration and product quality.

## 1. How Can I Contribute Code?

Contributions to GoogleTest and GoogleMock are welcomed and appreciated. Here’s how you can start:

- **Fork the Repository:** Begin by forking the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- **Create a Branch:** Work on your changes in a separate branch named clearly after your feature or fix.
- **Follow Coding Guidelines:** Ensure your code complies with Google’s [C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and passes all existing tests.
- **Write Tests:** Add new tests or extend existing ones to cover your changes.
- **Document Your Changes:** Update or add relevant documentation, including examples or usage notes.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR describing your changes clearly and referencing any related issues.

Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers and may request changes for clarity, functionality, or style.

<Tip>
Good commits have concise descriptions and references to related issues to help reviewers understand context and rationale.
</Tip>

## 2. How Do I Report Bugs or Issues?

To report bugs effectively and help developers address them swiftly:

- **Use GitHub Issues:** Open a new issue on the [GoogleTest GitHub issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- **Provide Clear Details:** Include a descriptive title, a clear explanation of the problem, and steps to reproduce it.
- **Include Environment Info:** Add your platform details, compiler version, and GoogleTest version.
- **Attach Minimal Examples:** If possible, share a minimal test case that reproduces the issue.
- **Describe Expected and Actual Behavior:** Clarify what you expected to happen and what actually happened.

<Tip>
Before reporting, check existing issues and FAQ sections like the [Legacy gMock FAQ](docs/gmock_faq.md) or [Mocking Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) to avoid duplicates and find quick workarounds.
</Tip>

- **Enhancing Guides:** Help structure content in user-friendly ways, focusing on outcomes and workflows.
- **Reporting Issues:** File issues if the docs are confusing, incomplete, or inconsistent.

Contributions to docs follow the same PR process as code.
