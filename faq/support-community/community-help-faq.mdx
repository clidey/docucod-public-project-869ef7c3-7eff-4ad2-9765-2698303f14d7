## How to Ask Questions Effectively

To get the best help from the community and maintainers:

1. **Search thoroughly** before asking to avoid duplicates.
2. **Provide context:** include your environment details (OS, compiler, GoogleTest version).
3. **Describe your problem in detail:** what you did, what you expected, what happened.
4. **Share code snippets or minimal reproductions:** small examples help others understand your issue quickly.
5. **Show error messages exactly:** copy full stack traces or logs.

Using these practices ensures quicker, higher quality responses.

## Requesting Support

If you encounter issues, consider the following support avenues:

- **Official Documentation:** The comprehensive user's guide and FAQ sections cover many common questions.
- **Community Forums:** Many experienced users frequent Stack Overflow and GitHub discussions.
- **Issue Tracker:** For bugs, file GitHub issues following the issue template.

Avoid support requests through personal emails or social media to keep the process efficient and transparent.
