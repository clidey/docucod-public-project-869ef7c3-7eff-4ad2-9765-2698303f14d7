## Contributing to GoogleTest & GoogleMock

We welcome contributions from everyone — whether it’s a bug fix, feature request, documentation improvement, or idea for enhancement. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Understand the Contribution Process

- **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository at [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- **Clone and Create a Branch:** Clone your fork locally and create a descriptive branch for your work.
- **Follow Coding Conventions:** GoogleTest uses consistent C++ style guidelines; please follow these to keep the codebase uniform.
- **Write Clear and Focused Commits:** Ensure commits are atomic and clearly describe the changes made.
- **Build and Test Locally:** Verify your changes build successfully and all tests pass. Writing new tests for bug fixes or features is highly encouraged.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** When ready, open a PR against the main branch. Include detailed information about what your change does and why.

### 2. Contribution Guidelines

- **Code Style:** Follow Google C++ style. Avoid introducing new dependencies or drastic architectural changes.
- **Testing:** Every new feature or bug fix should include tests covering the changed logic.
- **Documentation:** Update or add relevant documentation to explain your changes, especially if they affect public APIs.
- **License and Attribution:** Ensure all contributions comply with the project's [BSD-style license](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/LICENSE).
- **Respect Existing APIs:** Maintain backward compatibility unless the change is a deliberate breaking change with proper migration instructions.

### 3. Reporting Bugs

Help us improve the project by reporting issues you encounter.

- **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, search the existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- **Provide Clear Details:** Include information such as:
  - Environment details (compiler, OS, versions).
  - Steps to reproduce the problem.
  - Expected vs. actual behavior.
  - Minimal reproducible example (if possible).
- **Use the Issue Tracker:** Report bugs via the GitHub repository’s [Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).

### 4. Suggesting Features

Have a feature request or enhancement idea?

- **Open a Discussion or Issue:** Start by creating a new issue describing the feature, why it’s useful, and how it might be implemented.
- **Engage with Maintainers:** Discuss trade-offs, use cases, and scope with the maintainers and community.
- **Contribute a Prototype:** If possible, contribute a proof of concept or prototype as a PR to demonstrate your idea.

### 5. Contact Channels & Community Engagement

- **GitHub:** Main platform for issues, PRs, and discussions.
- **Mailing Lists & Forums:** Refer to the project’s README or website for community mailing lists or forums.
- **Chat/Slack:** If available, official chat platforms can be found linked in the project documentation.

### 6. Best Practices for Contributions

- **Start Small:** Tackle small issues or documentation improvements to familiarize yourself with the project.
- **Communicate Early:** Before diving deep, open an issue or discussion to gauge maintainers’ feedback.
- **Keep Pull Requests Focused:** Each PR should address one concern.
- **Respond to Feedback:** Be open to review comments and ready to iterate on your submission.

### Troubleshooting Contribution Issues

If you encounter difficulties during the contribution process:

- Verify you have the latest version of the main branch.
- Check for continuous integration (CI) failures in your PR and read their logs carefully.
- Ensure your branch history is clean (rebase if necessary).
- Ask for help by commenting on your PR or in community channels.
