# Contributing and Reporting Issues

Helping to improve GoogleTest and ensuring its robustness is a collaborative effort. This page guides you through how you can contribute to the project, report bugs, suggest features, and participate in the community while adhering to the project’s guidelines.

## 1. How to Contribute to GoogleTest

### a. Submitting Code Changes

GoogleTest encourages contributions ranging from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new features. To ensure your changes align with project standards:

- **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy at [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- **Work on a Branch:** Develop your feature or fix on a separate branch.
- **Follow Coding Standards:** Adhere to Google’s C++ style guide and test your changes thoroughly.
- **Write Tests:** Include unit tests for your new features or bug fixes.
- **Use `googletest` APIs Correctly:** Follow documented API usage to avoid regressions.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Clearly describe your change, referencing any related issues if applicable.

Before submitting, ensure your code passes existing tests and that your addition doesn’t break the build on supported platforms.

### b. Documentation Contributions

Clear and accurate documentation is vital. You can contribute by:

- Editing or improving existing documentation pages.
- Adding new sections or examples that clarify usage.
- Correcting typos or outdated information.

Changes to documentation follow the same PR process and should match the tone and style of the existing docs.

### c. Discussing Changes and Features

Engage with the community and maintainers through:

- GitHub issues to propose new features or improvements.
- Commenting on PRs for feedback.
- Participating in discussions and brainstorming for long-term vision.

## 2. Reporting Issues (Bugs and Problems)

### a. Bug Reports

Effective bug reports help maintainers understand and reproduce issues quickly. When reporting a bug:

- **Check Existing Issues:** Avoid duplicates by searching open and closed issues.
- **Provide Environment Details:** Include OS, compiler version, build system, and any relevant configuration flags.
- **Describe the Problem:** Clearly state what went wrong, including steps to reproduce it.
- **Include Minimal Example:** Provide a minimal code snippet or test case that reproduces the issue.
- **Show Expected vs Actual Behavior:** Clarify what you expect and what actually happens.
- **Attach Logs or Output:** Include relevant console output or error messages.

For build or installation issues, consult the [System Requirements](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.html) and [Installation and Build Problems FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq/common-issues/installation-build-problems.html) for troubleshooting before filing an issue.

### b. Feature Requests

If you want to suggest a new feature:

- Check if a similar feature request or discussion already exists.
- Explain the motivation, benefits, and potential use cases clearly.
- If possible, outline a possible API design or implementation approach.

## 6. FAQ: Common Contribution and Issue Reporting Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Contribution & Issue Reporting FAQ">
<Accordion title="How do I submit a bug report that is helpful?">
Provide detailed reproduction instructions, environment information, minimal code examples, and describe your expected versus actual outcomes. This accelerates diagnosis and fixes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I contribute documentation changes without code changes?">
Yes. Improving documentation, clarifying examples, fixing typos, and adding usage patterns are all welcome contributions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What should I do if my test fails after my changes?">
Re-run tests locally using flags like `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle`. Investigate failure messages, stack traces, and review if your changes could cause side-effects. Use existing debugging guides.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I write tests for my contributions?">
Use `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros with appropriate assertions. For advanced scenarios, leverage value and type-parameterized tests. Consult guides like [Writing Your First Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/core-workflows/writing-unit-tests.html).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is there a process for coding style and review?">
Follow Google’s C++ style guidelines and ensure all new code passes existing static analysis and style checks. PRs undergo review by maintainers before merging.

## Additional Notes

- Always update your fork with the latest from the main branch before creating PRs to reduce merge conflicts.
- Large features may benefit from opening a design discussion issue before coding.
- When submitting PRs, include relevant tests that verify your changes.
