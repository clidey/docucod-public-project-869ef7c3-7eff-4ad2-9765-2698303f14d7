# Getting Help & Reporting Issues

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are actively maintained open source projects with a vibrant community. This page provides you with clear guidance on how to seek help, file bug reports, and contribute improvements effectively, ensuring you get timely support and help maintainers respond efficiently.

---

## How to Get Help

### 1. Consult the Documentation

Before seeking additional help, we strongly recommend reviewing the official documentation thoroughly. You can find detailed usage guides, FAQs, and best practices that address most common issues:

- [GoogleTest Primer & Writing Your First Test](../guides/getting-started/writing-first-test)
- [Mocking Reference](../api-reference/mocking-apis/mock-methods)
- [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md)
- [Common Scenarios and Solutions](../guides/real-world-examples-integration/common-scenarios)

### 2. Search the Issue Tracker and Community Forums

Chances are someone else has encountered your problem before. Check:

- GitHub Issues: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues
- Google Test User Forum (if available)

Searching will help you find existing solutions or workarounds.

### 3. Reproduce and Simplify Your Problem

When asking for help, provide a minimal, complete, and verifiable example. This means:

- The code snippet should be as small as possible but still trigger the problem.
- Include relevant EXPECT_CALL / ON_CALL constructs if related to mocks.
- Mention your environment specifics (OS, compiler, GoogleTest version).

This makes it easier for maintainers and the community to understand and resolve your issue quickly.

### 4. Configure Verbosity for Diagnosis

If your problem involves unexpected or uninteresting calls, or confusing failures, run with the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag. This flag produces detailed logs of mock calls, expectation matching, and actions executed to help trace issues.

Example:

```shell
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

## How to File a Useful Bug Report

Providing a high-quality bug report accelerates diagnosis and resolution.

### What to Include:

- **Description**: Clearly explain what you expected and what happened instead.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: A minimal sample project or code snippet.
- **Test Environment**: OS, compiler version, GoogleTest/GMock commit or release version.
- **Log Output**: Relevant test output or warning/error messages.
- **Use of Verbosity**: Attach output from running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` if related to mock behavior.

### What to Avoid:

- Filing duplicate issues without checking existing reports.
- Posting too-large test projects without minimal reproducers.
- Vague descriptions like 'it doesn't work.'

### Example Bug Report Template

```
**Problem Description:**
Describe the unexpected behavior encountered.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Provide minimal code snippet
2. Build and run

**Expected Behavior:**

### Troubleshooting Common Assistance Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Help & Issue Engagement Topics">
<Accordion title="No Response on Issue or Pull Request">
If your issue or PR has not received any response after 2 weeks:

- Check if you provided enough detail.
- Add a polite comment asking for feedback.
- Review the project’s contribution policies to ensure compliance.

Maintainers prioritize issues affecting many users or severity.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Difficulty Reproducing Issue">
Simplify your code and environment as much as possible. Remove unrelated code.

Use a minimal example that triggers the bug.

Attach complete logs and information about your environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unclear Error Messages or Test Failures">
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get diagnostic logs.

Verify you are using supported compiler versions and platforms.

Check for common causes like missing EXPECT_CALLs or incorrect argument matchers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Help with Mocking Complex Interfaces">
Consult the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for advanced mocking patterns.

Provide interface definitions and describe your use case when requesting help.
