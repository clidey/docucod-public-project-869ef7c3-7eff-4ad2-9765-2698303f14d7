## Official User Guides

GoogleTest offers a rich set of user guides designed to cover all aspects of testing and mocking in C++. These guides provide step-by-step instructions, best practices, and illustrative examples.

- **GoogleTest Primer** — Start here to learn the basics of writing tests effectively: [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html)
- **Writing and Using Mocks** — Learn how to define mock classes, set expectations, and use mocks in your tests: [Mocking for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html)
- **gMock Cookbook** — A treasure trove of recipes and practical tips for advanced mocking use cases: [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)
- **Custom Matchers and Actions** — Extend gMock beyond built-in features with your own matchers and actions: [Creating Custom Matchers and Actions](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#defining-custom-matchers-and-actions)


## Advanced Resources and References

For deeper dives into the APIs, internal behaviors, and integration scenarios, consult these references:

- **Mocking Reference** — Complete details on mock method declarations, expectations, and mock behaviors: [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html)
- **Matchers Reference** — Explore the full list of built-in matchers and how to compose complex argument validations: [Matchers Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/matchers.html)
- **Actions Reference** — Comprehensive information on actions defining mock method behaviors and how to write your own: [Actions Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/actions.html)
- **GoogleTest API Reference** — Full API details for test fixtures, assertions, test runners, and flags: [API Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/index.html)


## Hosted Documentation vs. Local Copies

- **Hosted Documentation** is always the latest and ensures you see the most current features, changes, and best practices. It is accessible here:
  - https://google.github.io/googletest/

- **Local Offline Documentation** is available if you have cloned or downloaded the GoogleTest repository. It resides in the `/docs` directory and can be built and viewed locally.

  > **Tip:** If you are unsure whether your local docs are up to date, cross-reference with the hosted docs or consider updating your repository.


## Community Resources and Support

- **GoogleTest Community-Created Documentation** offers additional insights, tutorials, and practical examples beyond official docs.
- **Issue Tracker and GitHub Discussions:** For reporting bugs, requesting features, or engaging with other users and contributors, use the GitHub repository:
  - https://github.com/google/googletest
- **Mailing Lists and Forums:** GoogleTest has community mailing lists and forums where experienced users share advice and solutions.


## Getting Started and Next Steps

To quickly get up and running with testing and mocking, consider the following steps:

1. Read the **GoogleTest Primer** for test basics.
2. Learn mock creation and usage with **Mocking for Dummies**.
3. Explore specific mocking patterns and advanced features in the **gMock Cookbook**.
4. Practice with sample tests and gradually incorporate more complex assertions and matches.
