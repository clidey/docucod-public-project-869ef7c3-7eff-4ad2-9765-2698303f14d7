## Tips for Asking Good Questions or Reporting Issues

To get the most effective help from the community or maintainers, follow these guidelines:

- **Search First**: Consult existing issues and FAQ pages before posting.
- **Provide Context**: Include your GoogleTest/GoogleMock version (e.g., v1.17.0 or main branch), platform, and compiler details.
- **Minimal Reproducible Example**: Supply a small, complete code snippet that replicates the issue.
- **Describe Expected vs Actual Behavior**: Clearly explain what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
- **Include Error Messages and Logs**: Share the full output, stack trace, or error code.
- **Use Correct Tags and Titles**: Tag bug reports and questions accurately for visibility.
