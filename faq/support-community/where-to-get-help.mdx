# Where to Get More Help

As you explore and work with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, you may find occasions when you need additional help beyond what this documentation offers. Whether you are troubleshooting tricky issues, looking for usage examples, or want to tap into community wisdom, this page directs you to relevant support channels and resources.

## Community Forums and Discussion Groups

GoogleTest benefits from a vibrant open-source community of C++ developers who actively discuss issues, share tips, and provide guidance.

- **GitHub Discussions**: The main GoogleTest repository on GitHub hosts a Discussions area where users ask questions and share solutions. This is the best place for general usage queries and community-driven support.

- **Stack Overflow**: Use the tag [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) to search for existing questions or ask your own related to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Tagging your question with relevant keywords like `gmock` or `cpp-testing` helps attract knowledgeable answers.

- **Google Groups / Mailing Lists**: Occasionally, dedicated developer mailing lists or Google Groups may have active discussions. Check the project’s GitHub or official site for links or pointers.


## Issue Tracker and Bug Reports

When you encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or missing features, the **GitHub Issue Tracker** is the official venue to report them.

- Visit the [GoogleTest GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to:
  - Check if the issue has already been reported or addressed.
  - Submit a detailed bug report including reproduction steps and environment details.

Following the repository’s issue guidelines helps maintainers understand and prioritize problems efficiently.


## Support from the Documentation

Our documentation provides a rich array of resources that often answer common questions:

- **Primer and Getting Started Guides**: Step-by-step tutorials to get your tests running.
- **Mocking Guides and Cookbook**: Extensive examples, best practices, and advanced mocking patterns.
- **FAQ Pages**: Solutions to frequent issues, troubleshooting tips, and usage clarifications.

## Getting Professional Help

While GoogleTest is open source and free, some organizations rely on internal experts or third-party consultants for commercial support. Consider leveraging internal expertise if available.
