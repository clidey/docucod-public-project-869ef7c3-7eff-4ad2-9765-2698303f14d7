# Where Can I Get More Help?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have an active user community and several official channels where you can seek help, report issues, discuss your use cases, and share insights. Hereâ€™s how you can connect and get support from the community and maintainers:

---

## Official Forums and Mailing Lists

- **GoogleTest Users Google Group**
  - A primary forum for asking questions, sharing tips, and discussing testing and mocking with GoogleTest.
  - Email list link: [googletestframework@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/g/googletestframework)
  - Archives are public, making it a great resource to search past questions.


## Issue Tracker

- **GitHub Issues**
  - To report bugs, request features, or track ongoing problems, use the [GitHub Issue Tracker on the googletest repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
  - When opening an issue, provide clear reproduction steps and environment details to facilitate quick resolution.


## Real-Time Chat Channels

- Some community members and maintainers also use Slack or Discord channels for faster, interactive communication. Although unofficial, these channels are a valuable resource for timely help:

  - Check if your organization or team maintains an internal Slack workspace with GoogleTest topics.


## Documentation and Tutorials

- Sometimes the fastest help is self-service through official documentation, guides, and tutorials. These resources cover common questions and advanced topics:

  - [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md)
  - [GoogleMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html)
  - [GoogleTest FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq.html)
  - [GoogleMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html)


## Best Practices for Getting Help

- When posting questions or issues, include details such as:

  - Your platform, compiler, and build environment.
  - The exact problem, error message, or unexpected behavior.
  - Minimal reproducible code or configuration.
  - Steps you've already tried to solve the problem.

- Be respectful and concise to encourage prompt and helpful responses.


## Contributing Back

- If you find bugs or develop useful enhancements, consider contributing via pull requests on GitHub.
- Review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for contribution guidelines.
