## Common Issues & Troubleshooting Tips

While this page focuses on support resources, it is helpful to cite some common areas where users seek assistance:

- **Build and Integration Problems:** Ensure your build environment meets the requirements of supported compilers and C++ standards as described in [System Requirements](getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements.md).
- **Test Discovery and Filtering Issues:** Understand test selection and filtering based on [filter flags](docs/primer.md#running-subset-of-tests) and sharding environment variables.
- **Assertion Failures and Debugging:** Use GoogleTest’s assertion macros effectively, as detailed in [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md).
- **Handling Death Tests:** See the [Death Tests documentation](guides/scenarios-and-best-practices/death-tests-outcomes.md) for debugging and writing reliable death tests.
