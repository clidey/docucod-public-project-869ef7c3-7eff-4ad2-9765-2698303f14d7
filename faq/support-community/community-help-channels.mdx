## Issue Tracker

If you suspect you've encountered a bug or want to request a feature, the official issue tracker is the place to report it and follow updates.

- GitHub Issues: [https://github.com/google/googletest/issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

Before filing an issue, try:

- Searching existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Clearly describing your environment, problem, and steps to reproduce.
- Including minimal reproducible code if applicable.

The issue tracker also provides valuable information on known issues and workarounds.

## Discussion Forums and Community Engagement

Sometimes you need practical advice, usage tips, or help troubleshooting nuanced problems. The community is your ally.

- **Google Test Google Group** (mailing list)
- **Stack Overflow** with the [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) tag

Engage constructively, providing details for community members to assist.

## Community-Contributed Resources

The community around GoogleTest has created supplementary documentation and tutorials.

- [Community-Created Documentation](https://google.github.io/googletest/community_created_documentation.html): A collection of user-generated guides and insights.

These can be useful for real-world examples and alternative perspectives.

## Tips for Effective Help-Seeking

- Read the official docs fully before opening issues or asking for help.
- Isolate and reproduce problems in minimal test code.
- Share your build environment, compiler versions, and GoogleTest versions.
- Clearly state what you expected versus what you observed.

Adopting these habits accelerates diagnosis and support.
