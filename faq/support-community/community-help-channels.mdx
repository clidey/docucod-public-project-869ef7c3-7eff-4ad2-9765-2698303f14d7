## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, GoogleTest welcomes your reports to improve the product quality and usability.

### Where to Report

- **GitHub Issue Tracker:**
  Use the [GoogleTest GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to file your bug reports or feature requests.

### How to Report Effectively

When submitting an issue, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the problem or the feature you are requesting.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (for bugs).
- Example code snippets or test cases demonstrating the problem.
- The version of GoogleTest you are using.
- Your development environment details (OS, compiler version, build system).
- Any error messages or test output relevant to the issue.

Providing this information helps maintainers identify and address issues quickly.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests should describe the use case and how the feature would bring value to your testing workflows. This helps prioritize features that benefit the wider community.
