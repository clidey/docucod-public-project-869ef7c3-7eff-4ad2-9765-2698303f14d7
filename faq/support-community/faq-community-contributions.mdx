## Getting Started with Contributions

### 1. Understand the Project Structure and Contribution Workflow

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the project organization, coding conventions, and development practices:

- **Project Source & Tests:** The core of GoogleTest and GoogleMock is organized in the GitHub repository. Begin by exploring the [googletest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- **Documentation:** Read existing docs such as the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) and [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html) to understand APIs and usage.

### 2. Types of Contributions

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Code Contributions:** Fix bugs, add features, improve test coverage, or optimize the framework.
- **Documentation Enhancements:** Improve clarity, add tutorials, update usage guides, or fix broken links.
- **Examples & Recipes:** Share practical usage examples, custom matchers, or actions.
- **Issue Reporting and Triage:** Help identify bugs or suggest enhancements.

### 3. Contribution Process

Follow a standard Git workflow:

- Fork the repository and clone your copy.
- Create a feature branch for your changes.
- Develop and test your changes thoroughly.
- Follow the coding style and documentation standards.
- Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description.

Refer to the official project CONTRIBUTING.md file for detailed instructions.
