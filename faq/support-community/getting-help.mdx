## Opening an Issue: Reporting Bugs or Suggestions

When you encounter a bug or have a feature request, opening a detailed issue helps maintainers address it promptly.

### Best Practices for Opening Issues

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check if your problem or suggestion already exists to avoid duplicates.
2. **Clear Title**: Summarize the problem or feature clearly.
3. **Environment Details**: Include your platform, compiler, GoogleTest version, and build system used.
4. **Minimal Reproducible Example**: Provide a small, compilable code snippet that demonstrates the issue.
5. **Describe Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: Clarify what you expected to happen and what actually occurred.
6. **Attach Logs or Error Messages**: Include full error output or log excerpts.

The repository’s issue template helps prompt these details.

### Example to Report a Bug Effectively

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MyMock {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Foo, (int), ());
};

TEST(MyMockTest, Example) {
  MyMock mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(42))
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(100));

  int value = mock.Foo(42);
  EXPECT_EQ(value, 100);
}
```

This minimal snippet helps maintainers reproduce your issue faster.
