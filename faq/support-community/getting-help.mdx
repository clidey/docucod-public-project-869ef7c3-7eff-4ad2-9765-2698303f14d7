# Getting Help and Reporting Issues

This page guides you on how to seek official support, report bugs, or request new features effectively for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses on connecting users with the right channels and making the reporting process efficient and productive.

## When and Why to Ask for Help

Whether you are encountering build problems, unexpected test failures, or need assistance understanding GoogleTest functionalities, knowing where and how to ask for help saves you time and leads to better solutions.

- **Before Asking:**
  - Search the existing documentation and FAQs.
  - Verify your issue is reproducible with minimal code.
  - Attempt relevant troubleshooting guides linked in the documentation.

- **When to Reach Out:**
  - If your problem persists after using available resources.
  - When you encounter unexpected errors not covered by docs.
  - To request new features or report a confirmed bug.

## Official Support Channels

GoogleTest is an open-source project primarily supported by its community and maintainers via:

### Issue Tracker

Report bugs, submit feature requests, or suggest enhancements on GitHub Issues:

- [GoogleTest GitHub Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues)

**Tips for Effective Issue Reporting:**

- Provide a clear and descriptive title.
- Include environment details: OS, compiler version, build system, and GoogleTest version.
- Share minimal reproducible code snippets.
- Describe expected and actual behavior.
- Attach logs, error messages, or screenshots where applicable.

### GoogleTest Community & Forums

Engage with other users and contributors to troubleshoot, share knowledge, or discuss best practices.

- [GoogleTest Discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/google/googletest/discussions)
- Community-created documentation and tutorials (e.g., "[Googlemock Insights](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md)")

### Contribution Guides

For users interested in contributing fixes or enhancements:

- Follow the [GoogleTest contributing guidelines](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Adhere to coding style and testing policies.
- Submit pull requests with clear descriptions and tests.

## How to Report Bugs Effectively

1. **Ensure the Problem is Reproducible:**
   - Isolate the issue in a small test case.
   - Confirm it is not caused by your build environment or third-party code.

2. **Collect Diagnostic Information:**
   - Compiler and platform details (see [System Requirements](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements)).
   - The exact GoogleTest or GoogleMock versions.
   - Build commands and settings (especially if using CMake or Bazel).
   - Error messages and stack traces.

3. **Describe Expected vs Actual Behavior:**
   - What did you expect to happen?
   - What actually happened?

4. **Submit the Issue:**
   - Use the GitHub Issue template if provided.
   - Include all gathered details.

## Common Pitfalls When Asking for Help

- Providing vague or incomplete information.
- Asking without searching the existing documentation or issue tracker.
- Posting sensitive or proprietary code publicly.
- Not specifying your environment or versions clearly.

## Feature Requests and Suggestions

If you need new capabilities or improvements:

- Submit a detailed feature request via GitHub Issues.
- Explain the problem scenario and why the feature helps.
- Optionally suggest APIs or workflow changes.
