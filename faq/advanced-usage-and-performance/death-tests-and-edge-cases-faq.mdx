# Death Tests & Edge Case FAQ

This FAQ addresses common questions and challenges users face when working with death tests in GoogleTest, particularly focusing on platform limitations and special testing scenarios. It offers practical solutions for robust error testing and highlights best practices for managing non-standard cases.

---

## 1. What Are Death Tests and Why Use Them?

Death tests verify that certain code causes the process to terminate as expected, such as failing assertions or forced exits. They ensure that your software handles critical error conditions correctly by terminating rather than continuing in an invalid state.

For example, a death test can check that a function aborts when passed invalid input:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(Foo(-1), "Invalid argument");
```

Here, the test verifies that calling `Foo(-1)` causes a termination and that the error output matches the regex "Invalid argument".

See the [Death Assertions documentation](../reference/assertions.md#death) for the macros used.

---

## 2. How Do I Write Effective Death Tests?

- Use `ASSERT_DEATH` or `EXPECT_DEATH` macros inside your test function.
- Enclose code that should cause termination in a statement or compound block.
- Provide a regex or matcher verifying the error output on stderr.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, TerminatesOnError) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({
    int value = -100;
    ProcessValue(value);
  }, "Value out of range");
}
```

Ensure your death test suite names end with `DeathTest`. This helps GoogleTest run these tests first to reduce thread safety issues.

---

## 3. Why Are Death Tests Run in a Separate Process?

Death tests require the tested code to _terminate_ the process, which would otherwise abort the entire test run. GoogleTest spawns a child process to run that code separately:

- Parent forks or spawns a new process.
- Child runs the death test statement.
- Parent waits and verifies the child terminated as expected.

This isolates the side effects and prevents crashes from affecting the test suite.

---

## 4. What Are the Available Death Test Styles?

GoogleTest supports two main styles controlled by the `--gtest_death_test_style` flag:

| Style        | Description                                                                                     | Platforms                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `fast`       | Child process runs test code immediately after fork. Faster but less thread-safe.                | POSIX systems                              |
| `threadsafe` | Child process re-executes the test binary with filters to run only the death test. Safer with threads. | Windows, POSIX, Fuchsia, others            |

Set the style in your code or command line:

```cpp
GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
```

---

## 5. What Platforms Support Death Tests?

Death tests are supported on most POSIX systems, Windows, and Fuchsia. However, some platforms or build configurations may not support them, in which case:

- `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` and `ASSERT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` will skip the tests gracefully.
- A warning is printed if death tests are not supported on the platform.

---

## 6. How Can I Handle Multithreading Issues in Death Tests?

Forking processes in a multithreaded environment is challenging as `fork()` duplicates only the calling thread:

- GoogleTest warns you if multiple threads are detected when a death test runs in "fast" mode.
- Use `threadsafe` style to mitigate this by re-executing the test binary.
- To prevent deadlocks and hangs, ensure your test environment is as single-threaded as possible during death tests.

---

## 7. Can I Write Death Tests for Non-void Functions or Member Functions?

Yes, death tests support testing:

- Member functions
- Static member functions
- Functions returning values
- Global functions

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, MemberFunctionCausesDeath) {
  MyClass obj;
  EXPECT_DEATH(obj.FailMethod(), "Failing method");
}
```

---

## 8. What Are Some Common Pitfalls When Writing Death Tests?

- **Multiple Death Test Assertions on the Same Line:** Causes compilation errors. Place each on separate lines.
- **Using `return` inside death test code:** Illegal, will cause failure. Avoid `return` inside death test statements.
- **Expectations and mocks leaking:**  If you use mocks inside death tests, allow leaks via `Mock::AllowLeak()` to avoid false errors.
- **Assertions that throw exceptions inside death tests:** Exceptions escaping the death test cause failures.

---

## 9. What Kind of Regular Expressions Can I Use in Death Tests?

GoogleTest supports different regex dialects depending on platform and build:

- POSIX Extended Regex (most Unix-like systems)
- A simplified regex syntax on Windows and Mac

Supported elements include:
- Literal characters
- Character classes like `\d`, `\w`, `\s`
- Quantifiers like `?`, `*`, `+`
- Anchors `^` and `$`

Unsupported are union (`|`), grouping (`()`), brackets (`[]`), and repetition counts (`{m,n}`).

Write your death test regex within these constraints to ensure compatibility.

---

## 10. How Does GoogleTest Report Death Test Failures?

Upon failure, GoogleTest provides detailed messages outlining:

- Whether the test code executed but did not cause death
- Whether the process exited with an unexpected code or signal
- Whether the error output did not match the expected regex
- Detailed stderr output lines indented with `[  DEATH   ]` for clarity

Example failure message snippet:

```
Death test: { Foo(-1); }
  Result: failed to die.
 Error msg:
[  DEATH   ] Assertion failed: Invalid argument
```

If the death test aborted due to return or exception, GoogleTest reports this explicitly.

---

## 11. Can I Skip Death Tests on Unsupported Platforms?

Yes, use `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` or `ASSERT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` to run death tests only on supported platforms. On unsupported platforms, these macros issue a warning but do not fail.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED(Foo(-1), "Invalid argument");
```

---

## 12. Troubleshooting Common Death Test Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting Topics">
<Accordion title="Test Does Not Die as Expected">
- Verify the code inside the death test actually calls exit, abort, or similar.
- Avoid silent catch or swallow of fatal assertions or signals.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip if preconditions are not met.
- Check for side effects lost due to child process isolation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Failure Message Mismatch">
- Ensure your regex matches stderr output within supported regex dialect.
- Use simple and precise regex to cover key patterns.
- Test your regex separately with compatible regex engines.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Thread Safety Warnings or Hangs">
- Switch to `threadsafe` death test style.
- Ensure tests run single-threaded or prevent threads before death tests.
- Review any background threads started during static initialization.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Leak Errors in Death Tests">
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` for mock objects used in death tests.
- Memory leak detectors can misinterpret early exits caused by death tests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 13. Best Practices for Death Tests

- Name death test suites with the suffix `DeathTest`.
- Keep death test statements short and self-contained.
- Avoid complex side effects inside death test statements.
- Use the `threadsafe` style on multithreaded or complex environments.
- Use scoped traces (`SCOPED_TRACE`) to provide additional context in deeply nested code.
- Write clear and simple regex matchers that capture your key error messages.

  EXPECT_DEATH(Foo(-1), "Value out of range");
}

TEST(ExitCodeDeathTest, NormalExitWithCodeZero) {
  EXPECT_EXIT(NormalExit(), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "Success");

TEST(SignalDeathTest, KilledBySIGKILL) {
  EXPECT_EXIT(KillProcess(), testing::KilledBySignal(SIGKILL), "SIGKILL signal");
}
```

## 16. Tips

<Tip>
When writing death tests, remember that the code runs in a separate process, so any changes to global or static state inside the death test are not visible after it finishes. Plan your tests accordingly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If your program uses multiple threads, prefer setting death test style to "threadsafe" for stability and reliability.
</Tip>

<Tip>
To verify that your death test regex is correct, test it independently using regex testing tools compatible with the supported regex dialect.
</Tip>
