# Using Assertions and Matchers Effectively

Mastering assertions and matchers is key to writing robust and maintainable tests with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page guides you through choosing the right assertion, using matchers effectively—including custom matchers—and troubleshooting common pitfalls encountered when assertions fail or behave unexpectedly.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions: Matching Your Testing Intent

Assertions verify that your code behaves as expected. GoogleTest offers many assertion macros tailored for various scenarios:

- **Boolean assertions:** `EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_FALSE`
- **Equality and comparison:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE`
- **String comparisons:** `EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_STRNE` (for C strings)
- **Floating-point comparisons:** `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`
- **Exception assertions:** `EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW`
- **Generalized assertions with matchers:** `EXPECT_THAT` (allows powerful, readable conditions)

**Best Practice:** Use assertions that most precisely express the property you want to test. For example, use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` instead of `EXPECT_EQ` for floating-point numbers to account for rounding errors.

## 2. Harnessing Matchers for Expressive Tests

Matchers enable pattern-based validation of values and arguments in expectations and assertions. They provide a readable, flexible way to express "what" to expect rather than enumerating all valid values explicitly.

### 2.1 Built-in Matchers

GoogleMock includes an extensive set of built-in matchers such as:

- Wildcards: `_` matches anything.
- Comparisons: `Eq()`, `Ne()`, `Lt()`, `Le()`, `Gt()`, `Ge()`.
- String operations: `StrEq()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()`, `HasSubstr()`.
- Container matchers: `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `Contains()`, `Each()`, `SizeIs()`.
- Pointer matchers: `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`, `Pointee()` (validates pointed-to value).
- Composite matchers: `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(5))); // The argument should be >= 5
EXPECT_THAT(vec, ElementsAre(1, _, Gt(10))); // Container elements match pattern
```

### 2.2 Custom Matchers

When built-ins are insufficient, define custom matchers using:

- **MATCHER macros** for concise and readable definitions.
- **Full matcher classes** for advanced reuse, polymorphism, or complex descriptions.

Custom matchers must be functional and free of side effects since GoogleMock calls them unpredictably.

**Example:**
```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "") { return (arg % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsEven());
```

With detailed failure explanations using `result_listener`:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleBy, divisor, "") {
  if (arg % divisor == 0) return true;
  *result_listener << "which leaves a remainder " << (arg % divisor);
  return false;
}
EXPECT_THAT(13, IsDivisibleBy(5)); // Failure message includes the remainder
```

### 2.3 Matchers for Arguments in Mocks

Use matchers in `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to specify which method arguments matter:

- Use `_` to allow any value.
- Use specific value matchers like `Eq(42)` or `StartsWith("abc")`.
- Combine matchers to express complex constraints.
- Use `With()` to match multiple arguments as a tuple.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetValue(_, Ge(10))).With(Lt());
```

This checks the first argument (any) and second argument is >= 10 and the second is less than the first.

---

## 3. Common Pitfalls & How to Fix Them

### 3.1 Over-Specifying Calls

Avoid over-specifying argument matchers or call counts unnecessarily. This leads to brittle tests that fail on implementation detail changes.

Use `ON_CALL` to set default actions without enforcing call order or count, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying critical interactions.

### 3.2 Mistaking Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls

- **Uninteresting call:** No `EXPECT_CALL` is set for the method. It produces warnings unless suppressed by `NiceMock` or explicit catch-all expectations.
- **Unexpected call:** Arguments do not match any expectation. This is always an error.

Use `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress uninteresting call warnings for methods that can be called freely.

### 3.3 Wrong Use of Side Effects in Actions

Because `EXPECT_CALL` evaluates action expressions only once, using expressions with side effects inside `Return()` causes unexpected results.

**Instead of:**
```cpp
int i = 0;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).WillRepeatedly(Return(i++)); // Always returns 0
```
Use:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).WillRepeatedly(Invoke([&i]() { return i++; }));
```

### 3.4 Mocking Move-Only Types

Mock methods accepting and returning move-only types (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) must be mocked with `MOCK_METHOD` as usual.

- Return move-only values via lambdas rather than `Return()`.
- Accept move-only arguments normally.

Older workarounds involved delegating to non-moveable mock methods.

### 3.5 Overloaded Methods

For overloaded methods, fully specify matchers or use casting helpers like `TypedEq` or `Const()` to disambiguate.

### 3.6 Matching Non-Copyable Arguments

When a matcher argument is non-copyable, use `std::ref()` in matchers to pass by reference, ensuring the argument outlives the test.

### 3.7 Handling Complex Argument Matching

Use `SaveArg`, `SaveArgPointee`, and custom matchers to extract or verify complex parameter structures in multiple steps rather than writing unwieldy matchers.

## 4. Best Practices for Robust Assertion and Matcher Usage

- **Start simple:** Use simple matchers and basic assertions; add complexity only when necessary.
- **Use matchers to improve readability:** Instead of hardcoding exact values, use expressive matchers that clarify intent.
- **Leverage `EXPECT_THAT` for complex validations:** `EXPECT_THAT` works well with matchers for detailed and nuanced assertions.
- **Use sequences (`InSequence`) and partial order (`After`) when call ordering matters:**

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

- **Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky expectations when a call count limit is reached:** This prevents false failures when an expectation should become inactive.
- **Suppression of uninteresting calls:** Use `NiceMock` to silence warnings about methods you don't care about.
- **Customize default return actions with `ON_CALL`:** This ensures fallback behavior without enforcing call count.

---

## 5. Interpreting Assertion Failures

When an assertion fails, GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide detailed messages explaining:

- The expected matcher or condition.
- The actual value received.
- The reason for mismatch when possible (e.g., remainder when divisible check fails).

Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag during test runs to get verbose tracing of mock calls, which helps debug matching issues.

If an unexpected call occurs, check:

- Are your expectations correctly specified?
- Do your matchers correctly match the argument types and values?
- Is there a call order requirement that your code under test violates?

Use stack traces included in warnings/errors to locate the source of calls.

## 6. Advanced Matcher Techniques

### 6.1 Parameterized Matchers

Define matchers that accept parameters using `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, etc., for reusable conditions with descriptive failure messages.

Example:
```cpp
MATCHER_P(InRange, range, "") {
  return arg >= range.first && arg <= range.second;
}
EXPECT_THAT(value, InRange(std::make_pair(5, 10)));
```

### 6.2 Composite Matchers

Combine matchers elegantly with:

- `AllOf(m1, m2)`: value must match all.
- `AnyOf(m1, m2)`: value must match any.
- `Not(m)`: negates matcher.

### 6.3 Matching Container Elements

Use `ElementsAre`, `UnorderedElementsAre`, and `Contains` to specify expectations on container contents.

### 6.4 Matching Fields and Properties

Use `Field(&Class::member, matcher)` and `Property(&Class::getter, matcher)` to focus on specific members or getter methods within objects.

### 6.5 Matching Pointers and Pointees

`Pointee(matcher)` matches the value pointed to by a pointer, safely handling `nullptr`.

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Compile errors on mocking with templates or overloaded methods:** Wrap complicated type parameters in parentheses or use `using` aliases.
- **Warnings about "uninteresting mock function call":** Use `NiceMock` or add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` where appropriate.
- **Unexpected failures in strict `EXPECT_CALL` orders:** Verify sequences using `InSequence` or relax ordering constraints.
- **Default return value issues:** Use `ON_CALL` to set realistic default behaviors.
- **Slow compilation times:** Move mock class constructors and destructors to `.cc` files instead of header inline.

### Code Example: Combining Matchers and Assertions

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::Eq;
using ::testing::Ge;
using ::testing::Not;
using ::testing::ElementsAre;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int x, int y), ());
};

TEST(ExampleTest, ComputeBehavior) {
  MockFoo mock;

  // Expect Compute called with first arg >= 0 and second arg != 0
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(Ge(0), Not(0)))
      .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(5, 3), 42);
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(0, 1), 42);
}

TEST(ContainerTest, ElementsMatching) {
  std::vector<int> vec = {1, 3, 5};
  EXPECT_THAT(vec, ElementsAre(Eq(1), Ge(2), Not(4)));
}
```

This example illustrates the use of matchers in expectations and assertions for clarity, flexibility, and robust verification.
