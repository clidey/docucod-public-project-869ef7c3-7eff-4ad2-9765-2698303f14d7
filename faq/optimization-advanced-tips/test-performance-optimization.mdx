# Test Performance Optimization Tips

Optimizing test performance is essential when working on large C++ projects using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide focuses on strategies and best practices to efficiently run tests, reduce runtime, and maintain clean, fast test builds. We cover parallel execution, test filtering, minimizing overhead, and practical tips for writing running tests that scale smoothly.

---

## 1. Why Optimize Test Performance?

As your project's test suite grows, test runtime and resource usage can increase significantly. Slow tests undermine developer productivity and continuous integration throughput. By optimizing test performance, you ensure faster feedback, increased confidence, and a smoother development experience.


## 2. Parallel Test Execution

GoogleTest supports safe parallel test execution to leverage multiple CPU cores.

- **Thread-Safe APIs**: GoogleTest APIs are thread-safe, enabling concurrent test runs without race conditions.
- **Sharding**: Distribute tests across machines or processes using test filters to divide workload evenly.

**How to enable parallelism:**
Use test runners or build tools supporting parallel runs (e.g., CTest with `--parallel`, Bazel’s `--jobs`). Alternatively, manually shard tests via the `--gtest_filter` flag, running subsets of tests concurrently.

<Tip>
Always ensure tests are isolated and do not share state across threads or processes to prevent flaky results.
</Tip>

## 3. Test Filtering for Efficient Runs

During development, running the entire test suite may be unnecessary and costly.

- Use `--gtest_filter=PositivePattern[-NegativePattern]` to select relevant tests.
- Combine filters to exclude slow or flaky tests temporarily.
- Create filter aliases or scripts for common subsets.

<Note>
Filtering reduces overhead by limiting test discovery and execution only to what's needed.
</Note>

## 4. Writing Fast and Focused Tests

- **Minimize Setup and Teardown:** Limit expensive initialization in test fixtures.
- **Use Mocks and Fakes Wisely:** Replace expensive dependencies with lightweight mocks using GoogleMock, but avoid over-mocking which can complicate tests.
- **Avoid Global State:** Prevent contention by isolating changes within test scope.

<Warning>
Beware of side effects or hidden costs in your mocks – excessive overhead here can nullify gains.
</Warning>

## 5. Reducing Compilation Overhead

Mock classes can introduce large compile times.

- Move mock constructors and destructors to `.cc` files to speed up incremental compilation.
- Limit the number of unique mock methods when practical.

## 6. Managing Test Output Verbosity

Excessive logging slows down execution and clutters output.

- Adjust gMock verbosity with `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning`, `error`), using `warning` or `error` for faster runs.
- Use GoogleTest’s `--gtest_brief=1` or custom event listeners to reduce output.

## 7. Practical Tips for Scaling Large Test Suites

- **Use `NiceMock` for Reduced Noise:** Suppresses uninteresting call warnings, reducing log overhead.
- **Retire Expectations When Done:** Using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` in `EXPECT_CALL` avoids sticky expectations, improving performance in sequences of calls.
- **Delegate Complex Behavior:** For mocks with default behavior, delegate with `ON_CALL` to avoid redundant expectations.

## 8. Example: Using RetiresOnSaturation for Ordered Calls

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
using ::testing::StrictMock;
using ::testing::Return;

StrictMock<MockFoo> mock;
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(1)).WillOnce(Return(10)).RetiresOnSaturation();
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(2)).WillOnce(Return(20)).RetiresOnSaturation();
}

// Calls must occur in order and expectations retire after use, improving matching performance.
EXPECT_EQ(10, mock.Foo(1));
EXPECT_EQ(20, mock.Foo(2));
```

## 9. Preventing Leaked Mocks Impact on Performance

- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_ptr)` if a mock is intentionally leaked to avoid false leak warnings and associated overhead.
- Leaked mocks not destroyed cause missed verification and potential memory bloat.

## 10. Verifying and Clearing Expectations in Long-Running Tests

For long-living mocks, periodically verify and clear expectations with:

```cpp
::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

This avoids excessive accumulation and improves memory usage.

## Summary
Efficient test performance relies on parallel execution, targeted test filtering, smart use of mocks, and minimizing test and compile overhead. Proper expectation management with RetiresOnSaturation and clean mock lifetimes help maintain speed and reliability. By following these tips, you keep your project’s tests running quickly and smoothly, allowing faster feedback and more productive development cycles.
