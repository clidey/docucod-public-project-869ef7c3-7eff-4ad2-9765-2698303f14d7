# Solving Test Discovery and Execution Problems

This FAQ page addresses frequent issues encountered when GoogleTest or GoogleMock tests fail to run or when test binaries produce confusing output. It guides you through understanding common causes such as missing `main()` functions, incorrect initialization, and build misconfiguration. Tailored solutions for various scenarios and environments are provided to ensure smooth test discovery and execution.

## 1. Why Are My Tests Not Running?

If you have written tests but none seem to execute, or you do not see any output indicating test execution, it is most likely due to missing or incorrectly defined main functions or improper initialization.

### Typical Causes

- No entry point (`main` function) defined in your test executable.
- Forgetting to call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` or `testing::InitGoogleMock()` before running tests.
- Linking against the wrong GoogleTest/GoogleMock libraries (e.g., linking to `gtest` instead of `gtest_main`).

### How to Fix

<Steps>
<Step title="Provide a main() Function or Link to One">
GoogleTest requires a `main()` function to run the tests. You can either:

- Link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries which provide a default implementation.
- Define your own `main()` function in your test binary. For example:

```cpp
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Ensure `testing::InitGoogleTest()` or `testing::InitGoogleMock()` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
</Step>

<Step title="Use testing::InitGoogleMock for Tests Using GoogleMock">
If your tests use GoogleMock, prefer `testing::InitGoogleMock()` which initializes GoogleTest and GoogleMock properly:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This replaces calling `InitGoogleTest()` alone and avoids missing mock initialization.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Your Linkage">
Make sure you link your test binaries properly:

- Link with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to provide the default `main()`.
- If defining your own `main()`, link with `gtest` and/or `gmock` but not `gtest_main`.

Incorrect linkage often leads to linker errors or no tests running.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Test Registration">
Verify your test files include or link to the test definitions so they get registered correctly.

GoogleTest automatically registers tests defined with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.

If you are using dynamic loading or other complex build systems, ensure the test symbols are included in the linker unit.
</Step>

<Step title="Run With Verbose Output for Diagnostics">
Use the flag `--gtest_list_tests` to verify that GoogleTest detects your tests. For example:

```sh
./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
```

This will print all test suites and test cases recognized. If no tests are shown, the problem is in test registration.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
When writing custom `main()`, always remember to return the value from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Ignoring the return value can cause CI systems to misinterpret test results.
</Tip>

## 2. Why Do Tests Run But Produce Confusing or No Output?

Sometimes tests run but no informative output or incorrect results are shown. Common causes include verbose flag misconfiguration or missing mock initialization.

### Key Problems & Solutions

- **Missing Initialization of GoogleMock**: Calling only `InitGoogleTest()` without `InitGoogleMock()` means mocks might not be properly initialized.

- **Verbose Flag Settings Suppressing Output**: The `--gmock_verbose` flag controls logging detail. Setting it too restrictively can hide messages.

- **Unexpected Behavior of Uninteresting or Unexpected Calls** can confuse test outcomes.

### Recommended Actions

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize GoogleMock Correctly">
Use the recommended initialization in your `main` function:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

If you are only using GoogleTest, `InitGoogleTest()` is enough, but when GoogleMock is involved `InitGoogleMock()` is preferred.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust Verbosity Flags for Diagnostic Output">
To see detailed trace information during testing, use:

```sh
./my_tests --gmock_verbose=info
```

This setting prints all mock function calls, warnings, and stack traces, which can aid in troubleshooting test failures and confusing calls.
</Step>

<Step title="Manage Uninteresting Mock Calls">
Uninteresting calls are mock function calls with no explicit expectation. By default, GoogleMock warns about them. You can control this behavior via mock wrappers:

- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress warnings on these calls.
- Use `NaggyMock<T>` (default) to show warnings only.
- Use `StrictMock<T>` to treat uninteresting calls as errors.

Example:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
```

Use this approach to reduce noise during tests.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If your mocks or tests crash unexpectedly, consider running with sanitizer tools or increasing verbosity to identify the source of problematic mock calls.
</Note>

## 3. Are There Platform-Specific Considerations?

Yes. Especially on embedded or mobile platforms, custom main loops or setup functions may be used.

For instance, on ESP8266, ESP32, or NRF52 Arduino environments, GoogleMock provides sample `setup()` and `loop()` functions as entry points instead of `main()`.

Make sure you integrate GoogleMock's initialization appropriately according to your platform.

See sample code in `gmock_main.cc` for platform-specific implementations.

## 4. How to Debug Test Discovery and Execution Problems?

### Step-By-Step Debugging Process

- **Run tests with `--gtest_list_tests`** to verify recognized tests.
- **Check linker inputs and object files** to confirm all test modules are linked.
- **Enable verbose output with `--gmock_verbose=info`** to trace mock calls.
- **Inspect your test registration macros (`TEST()`, `TEST_F()`)** for correctness.
- **Ensure no conflicting or missing macros** hurt test discovery.

### Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to initialize GoogleMock before running tests.
- Overlapping or shadowed expectations causing unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect macro usage or method signatures causing tests to be skipped.

### Practical Tips

- Write a minimal test with a `TEST` macro to verify basic test execution.
- Incrementally add mocks and expectations to isolate the source of issue.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings initially, then tighten expectations.

## 5. Example Minimal Test Main for GoogleMock

```cpp
#include "gmock/gmock.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Ensure your build links to `gmock_main` or the equivalent object file implementing the above, or provide it yourself if writing a custom `main()`.
