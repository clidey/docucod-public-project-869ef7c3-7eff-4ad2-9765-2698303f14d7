# What advanced testing features does GoogleTest offer?

GoogleTest provides a rich set of built-in and customizable testing features to help you design robust, maintainable, and high-coverage C++ tests. This guide offers quick-access answers about advanced constructs, empowering you to fully leverage GoogleTest’s testing capabilities.

---

## 1. Assertions and Custom Assertions

GoogleTest includes a comprehensive suite of assertions to validate conditions in tests, divided mainly into *fatal* (`ASSERT_*`) and *non-fatal* (`EXPECT_*`) checks. Both kinds provide detailed diagnostics on failures.

- **Built-in Assertions:** Check expressions, equality, exceptions, approximate floats, strings, and container contents.
- **Predicate Assertions:** Use predicates returning `::testing::AssertionResult` for clearer custom checks.
- **Custom Assertions:** Define your own assertions easily; include explanations on failure, improving test readability and diagnostics.

### Example: Writing a Custom Assertion

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even.";
}

TEST(MyTest, CheckEven) {
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, 4);  // Passes
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, 5);  // Fails with message
}
```

For detailed usage and all available assertions, see [GoogleTest Assertions Reference](api-reference/core-testing-interfaces/test-macros-assertions.md).

## 2. Death Tests

Death tests allow you to verify that your program crashes or terminates as expected under erroneous conditions.

- Use macros like `ASSERT_DEATH` and `EXPECT_DEATH` to write tests that verify process termination with specific error messages.
- Support multiple styles for running death tests, including fast and threadsafe.
- Includes best practices and tips to write reliable death tests, minimizing flaky failures.

### Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, CrashesOnNull) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(
    Foo(nullptr),
    "null pointer passed"
  );
}
```

Learn more in the [Death Tests Guide](guides/advanced_testing_patterns/death_testing.md).

## 3. Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest offers powerful parameterized tests that enable running a single test logic against multiple values or types, reducing duplication and improving coverage.

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** 
  - Use `TEST_P` macros with parameterized fixtures.
  - Instantiate with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` and parameter generators like `Range()`, `Values()`, or custom generators.
  - Support naming customization for clearer test reports.

- **Type-Parameterized Tests:**
  - Use `TYPED_TEST` and `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` macros to run tests over different types.

### Example: Value-Parameterized Test

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, FooTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

### Example: Type-Parameterized Test

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTemplateTest : public testing::Test {};

typedef ::testing::Types<int, double> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTemplateTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTemplateTest, DoesSomething) {
  TypeParam value{};
  EXPECT_TRUE(DoSomething(value));
}
```

For comprehensive information, see the [Value- and Type-Parameterized Tests Documentation](api-reference/core-testing-interfaces/parameterized-and-typed-tests.md) and [Advanced GoogleTest Topics on Parameterized Tests](guides/advanced_testing_patterns/parameterized_tests.md).

## 4. Custom Test Environments and Event Listeners

Extend GoogleTest to suit your test infrastructure and reporting needs.

- Define global or per-test environments by subclassing `::testing::Environment`, allowing you to set up and tear down shared resources.
- Implement custom event listeners via the event listener interface to monitor test execution events:
  - Test start and end
  - Assertion results
  - Environment setup and teardown
- Compose and replace existing listeners to customize output or integrate with build tools and CI systems.

### Example: Custom Environment

```cpp
class MyEnvironment : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // global setup code
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // global cleanup code
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnvironment);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Example: Using Event Listeners

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::TestEventListeners& listeners = 
      ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
  listeners.Append(new MyListener);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

For detailed capabilities and customization guidance, see the [Test Environment and Event Listeners Reference](api-reference/core-testing-interfaces/test-environment-and-event-listeners.md) and the [Customization and Extension Concepts](concepts/advanced-topics/customization-extension.md).
