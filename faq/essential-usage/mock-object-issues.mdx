# Troubleshooting Mock Object and Expectation Problems

This FAQ addresses the most frequent questions and common errors encountered when defining, using, or verifying mock objects with GoogleMock. It clarifies key concepts such as the differences between `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`, lifetime issues of mocks, and typical pitfalls when working with `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and `NaggyMock`. Alongside explanations, it provides practical diagnostic steps and recommended usage patterns to help you resolve issues effectively.

---

## 1. Understanding ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL

### What is the difference between `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`?

- `ON_CALL` defines **default behaviors** for mock methods but does **not** set any expectations that the method will be called. It's used to specify what should happen when a mock method is invoked without asserting that it must be called.

- `EXPECT_CALL` sets an **expectation** that the method will be called with specified arguments, a number of times, and optionally in an order. It also configures the behavior in response to calls.

### When should I use `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`?

Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors typically in the mock object's constructor or test setup. This avoids over-specifying tests and makes them more maintainable by not enforcing unnecessary call expectations.

Use `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to **verify that your code actually makes specific calls** to the mock methods under test.

### Why do I get "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings even when I use `ON_CALL`?

Because `ON_CALL` doesn't set expectations, calls to such methods are considered "uninteresting" by default and will generate warnings unless you:

- Change the mock to `NiceMock` which suppresses uninteresting call warnings,
- Add an `EXPECT_CALL` with `.Times(AnyNumber())` for methods you want to ignore,
- Or set `--gmock_verbose=error` to suppress these warnings globally.

## 2. Issues with Mock Object Lifetimes

### My mock object isnâ€™t destroyed when I expect it to be. What problems can this cause?

GoogleMock verifies expected calls when the mock object is destroyed. If the object lives longer than expected or leaks, unsatisfied expectations may never be detected, causing false positive test results.

### How do I force verification if the mock isn't going out of scope?

Use `::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object)` to verify expectations before destruction. This is useful when mocks are owned by other code or intentionally leak.

### What if my mock object is deleted within a mock method call's action?

GoogleMock supports deleting a mock object inside its method call action, but exercise caution to avoid dangling references later. Use the `Delete` action or a lambda that deletes the mock safely.

---

## 3. Using NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock

### What are `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`?

These are wrappers around your mock class that control how uninteresting calls (calls to methods without explicit expectations) are handled:

- **`NiceMock<T>`:** Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls. Best for most testing scenarios to reduce noise.

- **`NaggyMock<T>`:** The default mock type; prints warnings on uninteresting calls but does not fail the test.

- **`StrictMock<T>`:** Treats all uninteresting calls as errors, causing test failures. Useful for precise enforcement but risks brittle tests.

### When should I use these modes?

- Prefer `NiceMock` generally to keep tests maintainable and avoid noisy warnings.

- Use `NaggyMock` during test development to confirm you're aware of unexpected calls.

- Use `StrictMock` sparingly when you need to enforce strict call expectations and are confident the interface is stable.

### Can I nest these mocks, like `NiceMock<StrictMock<T>>`?

No. GoogleMock does not support nesting strictness modes due to compiler and implementation limitations.

### Are there cases where these modes do not affect all methods?

Yes. They only work for mock methods **declared directly** in the mocked class (via `MOCK_METHOD`) and may not affect mock methods inherited from base classes.

### What happens if a mock method returns a non-default-constructible type and gets called unexpectedly?

`NiceMock` will throw a runtime exception indicating the method was called unexpectedly without a default behavior. Other modes may behave differently.

## 4. Common Mistakes and Their Solutions

### Why am I getting confusing compilation errors with `MOCK_METHOD` on methods with comma-containing types?

Types such as `std::pair<bool, int>` or `std::map<int, double>` contain commas that need protection.

**Solution:**
- Wrap such types in parentheses in `MOCK_METHOD`, e.g.,

  ```cpp
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool));
  ```

- Or define type aliases for those complex types and use them as the return or argument type.

### Why does `MOCK_METHOD` need to be in the `public` section even for mocking protected or private methods?

Because GoogleMock's macros `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` need to access the mock methods from outside the class, and C++ allows a subclass to increase accessibility.

Place all `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public` section regardless of the base method's access.

### What do I do if a method is overloaded?

You must mock all overloads you want to intercept individually with `MOCK_METHOD`.

To avoid hiding base class overloads, pull them into scope with `using Base::MethodName;`.

Use `Const()` wrapper for const overloads when setting expectations.

### My expectations are failing because of the "newer expectations override older ones" rule. How do I fix that?

- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations retire as they saturate.
- Place expectations in an `InSequence` block to enforce call ordering.
- Use multiple `WillOnce()` calls in a single `EXPECT_CALL` for ordered responses.

### I keep getting "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings. How do I suppress them without hiding real bugs?

- If you don't care about certain calls, use `NiceMock`.
- Add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, MethodName(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly allow any calls.
- Avoid suppressing warnings by never writing empty `EXPECT_CALL`s without `.Times(AnyNumber())`.

### What if I need the mock method to return live or changing values?

Use actions like `ReturnPointee(&variable)` to return the current value pointed by a variable instead of an evaluated constant. Avoid `Return(std::ref(variable))` as it captures the value at expectation set time, leading to unexpected results.

### How do I mock move-only types?

You can mock methods with move-only types such as `std::unique_ptr` using `MOCK_METHOD` normally. Set actions using lambdas or callable objects that create or manipulate the move-only types. Avoid using `Return(std::move(...))` repeatedly as the source is consumed.

For older codebases, a workaround is to delegate move-only parameter methods to separate mock methods that accept raw pointers.

## 5. Diagnosing Expectation Failures

### How to debug when my expectations are not satisfied?

- Run tests with the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs of mock calls and matching expectations.
- Review the output logs to see which expectations were tried and why they did or did not match.
- Confirm that argument matchers align with actual call parameters.
- Check call order constraints, sequences, and `.After()` dependencies.

### What does it mean when I see repeated failure messages for the same expectation?

Multiple failures can be reported for the same expectation but at different points in time; this is intentional as it shows the sequence of failures and where the expectation was unsatisfied.

### Why does my mock function called more times than expected?

This usually indicates that your `Times()` cardinality in `EXPECT_CALL` is incorrectly set or your code under test is calling the method too many times. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectation to mark it inactive after being saturated to avoid overlapping matches.

### What are "uninteresting" vs "unexpected" calls?

- An **uninteresting call** is one with **no matching `EXPECT_CALL`** set. By default, it triggers a warning but is not an error.
- An **unexpected call** is one where **some `EXPECT_CALL`s exist**, but none match the call's arguments or invocation constraints. This triggers an error.

### How do I handle tests where asynchronous calls or threading causes expectation mismatches?

- Use synchronization primitives (`Notification`, mutexes) and GoogleMock actions to coordinate.
- Set expectations carefully with `.Times()` and sequences.
- Make sure you set expectations before calls happen.

## 6. Best Practices to Avoid Common Pitfalls

- **Set expectations before the code under test invokes the methods.**
- **Prefer `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors** and restrict use of `EXPECT_CALL` to where verification is meaningful.
- Use `NiceMock` for mocks when you want to ignore uninteresting calls safely.
- Use sequences and `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to manage call order and expectation lifetimes.
- Avoid over-specifying matchers or call counts; be precise but as loose as possible.
- Use `WillRepeatedly` combined with `WillOnce` wisely to specify behaviors for calls.
- Avoid mixing mock strictness types for the same mock class hierarchy.
- When mocking complex types or overloaded functions, use type aliases and helpers to clarify mock declarations.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` judiciously if mock lifetime cannot be managed properly.

## 9. Quick Tips

- Always put `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the public section.
- Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors; reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for expectations you want to verify.
- Apply `RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations with limited call counts.
- Utilize `InSequence` blocks to enforce call ordering.
- Test with `--gmock_verbose=info` for verbose diagnostic output.
- Consider wrapping complex argument types with type aliases.
- Use `WillOnce` chained with `WillRepeatedly` to simulate sequences of responses.

<Tip>
Keep your tests maintainable by using mock strictness modes thoughtfully: start with `NiceMock` to reduce noise, escalate to `NaggyMock` and `StrictMock` only when you need more rigorous enforcement.
