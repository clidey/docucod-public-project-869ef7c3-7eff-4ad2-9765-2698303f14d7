# Resolving Test Failures and Debugging

This FAQ addresses the common questions and challenges users face when tests fail or behave unexpectedly in GoogleTest. It guides you through understanding assertion failures, diagnosing flaky tests, and handling platform-specific quirks, enabling you to confidently interpret results and smoothly debug issues.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Failures

Failures are the primary signal that your code or tests didn't behave as expected. GoogleTest provides detailed, expressive assertion failure messages designed to pinpoint issues precisely.

### 1.1 Types of Assertions and Failure Effects

- **ASSERT_***: Generate *fatal failures*; immediately exit the current function (usually aborting the test). Use when continuing makes no sense.
- **EXPECT_***: Generate *nonfatal failures*; record the failure but continue executing the current function, revealing multiple errors in one run.

### 1.2 Interpreting Failure Messages

Failure messages include:

- The expression tested
- Actual and expected values with formatted differences
- Location in source code (file and line number)
- Optional streamed user messages
- Stack trace (if enabled)

For example:

```none
path/to/file.cc:42: Failure
Value of: result
  Actual: 4
Expected: 5
```

The message shows: what was checked, what values were observed, and where in the code this happened.

> **Tip:** Use custom messages to add context:
> ```cpp
> ASSERT_EQ(x, y) << "x and y should match after update";
> ```

### 1.3 Common Assertion Macros in Failures

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`: checks equality.
- `EXPECT_TRUE(cond)`: asserts `cond` is true.
- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)`: compares C strings by content.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)`: checks numeric closeness.
- `ASSERT_THROW(statement, exception_type)`: expects an exception.

See the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) for a complete list.

### 1.4 Advanced Assertion Techniques

- Use **`EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)`** with rich matchers for readable, composable checks.
- Use **predicate assertions** (e.g., `EXPECT_PRED2`) to test complex conditions with detailed failure diagnostics.
- Use **`SCOPED_TRACE`** to add context to failures happening inside helper functions or loops.


## 2. Diagnosing and Debugging Test Failures

When you see a failure, follow this flow to efficiently diagnose and fix it.

### 2.1 Confirm the Failure

- Ensure test output is fully flushed.
- Check the failure message and location.
- Re-run the test in isolation to confirm it consistently fails.

### 2.2 Analyze the Failure Message

- Identify the assertion macro that failed.
- Note the actual versus expected values.
- Use the provided stack trace to locate the source.
- Look for any custom failure messages added in the test.

### 2.3 Common Pitfalls

- Using **`ASSERT_*`** in sub-routines can abort only the current function, not the entire test. Combine with `HasFatalFailure()` or `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` to prevent continuing after critical failures.

- Flaky tests often arise from external dependencies, race conditions, or uninitialized resources.

### 2.4 Debugging Flaky or Intermittent Failures

- Run tests multiple times with `--gtest_repeat=N` to observe failure frequency.

- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test order and reveal dependencies between tests.

- Consider using `--gtest_break_on_failure` for debugger breakpoints at failure moments.

- Check for shared state or non-deterministic dependencies.

### 2.5 Using Test Events and Listeners

For advanced debugging and test introspection, you can:

- Implement custom [`TestEventListener`](reference/testing.md#TestEventListener) to log or react to test events.
- Use existing listeners to generate XML or JSON reports that detail failures.

## 3. Handling Platform-Specific Issues

### 3.1 Compiler and Runtime Compatibility

- Confirm your compiler supports C++17 or later.
- Make sure your runtime linkage is consistent (e.g., MSVC run-times).
- Beware platform-specific macros and behaviors affecting tests.

### 3.2 Character Encoding in Failures

- GoogleTest handles wide strings and converts them to UTF-8 when streaming failure messages.
- Ensure your terminal or test output supports UTF-8 for accurate rendering.

### 3.3 Signal and Exception Handling

- GoogleTest detects structured exceptions on Windows and can catch C++ exceptions.
- Use `--gtest_catch_exceptions=0` to disable catching for easier debugger integration.

### 3.4 Death Tests

- Use `ASSERT_DEATH` and variants to test code paths expected to terminate.
- Follow conventions by naming death test suites with the suffix `DeathTest`.

## 4. Capturing and Responding to Failures in Code

### 4.1 Checking Failure Status Inside Tests

GoogleTest provides API to check test status dynamically:

- `Test::HasFatalFailure()` returns `true` if a fatal failure has occurred in the current test case.
- `Test::HasNonfatalFailure()` returns `true` if any nonfatal failure has occurred.
- `Test::HasFailure()` returns `true` if any failure (fatal or non-fatal) has occurred.

Use these to conditionally abort complex test logic when failures occur in a sub-routine.

```cpp
if (testing::Test::HasFatalFailure()) return;
```

### 4.2 Asserting Expected Failure in Test Utilities

When developing test helpers that should themselves fail to assist testing, use the macros from `gtest/gtest-spi.h`:

- `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` asserts that `statement` triggers a fatal failure message containing `substring`.
- `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` for non-fatal failures.

These are essential for testing the testing framework or extensions.

## 5. Best Practices for Successful Debugging

- Write clear and precise assertions.
- Add custom failure messages to clarify intent.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to provide context inside helper functions.
- Avoid mixing `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*` without understanding control flow.
- Leverage test filtering to isolate failures.
- Use `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` flags to uncover flaky dependencies.
- Confirm environment consistency across platforms.

## Practical Debugging Scenario Example

Imagine your test `AmazonOrderTest.CheckoutProcess` fails with:

```none
path/amazon_order_test.cc:112: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  expected_total
    Which is: 150
  actual_total
    Which is: 145
```

1. Confirm this is consistent by isolating the test case.
2. Review assertion line (112) and values causing mismatch.
3. Add debug prints or use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT` or `ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT` with custom diagnostics to get more insights.
4. If flaky, repeat test multiple times using `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle`.
5. Check for any shared state or concurrency issues affecting total calculations.

This flow applies broadly across most assertion failures.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Did you run `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`?
- [ ] Is your assertion failure message clear and does it contain expected vs actual values?
- [ ] Did you use the correct assertion (`EXPECT_` vs `ASSERT_`) to control flow?
- [ ] Have you isolated flaky tests using repeat and shuffle flags?
- [ ] Are you handling platform-specific settings, particularly for wide strings and exceptions?
- [ ] Use `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` to verify expected failures in test helpers.
