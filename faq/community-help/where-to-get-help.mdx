## Reporting Bugs and Issues

When you discover a bug or unexpected behavior in GoogleTest or GoogleMock, please follow these best practices for reporting:

### Steps for Reporting an Issue

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before opening a new issue, search the GitHub Issues [page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported or resolved.

2. **Provide Clear Reproduction Steps:** Include a minimal, complete, and verifiable example that reproduces the bug. Describe your environment including:
   - Operating system and version
   - Compiler and version
   - GoogleTest/GoogleMock version or commit hash
   - Build system used (CMake, Bazel, Makefile, etc.)

3. **Describe Expected vs Actual Behavior:** Clearly explain what you expected to happen and what actually happened.

4. **Attach Logs and Error Messages:** Provide relevant error messages, stack traces, or outputs.

5. **Use Templates When Available:** The GitHub Issues interface offers templates to structure bug reports; follow them closely for best results.

### Bug Triage and Response

The GoogleTest development team monitors issue reports regularly and prioritizes them by severity and impact. Community members often assist in diagnosing and fixing bugs.

## Requesting Features

Want a new feature or improvement in GoogleTest or GoogleMock? Here's how to proceed:

1. **Search Existing Feature Requests:** Confirm if your feature is already requested or planned by reviewing open feature issues.

2. **Open a New Feature Request Issue:** Use the GitHub Issues page and select the feature request template if available.

3. **Describe the Problem and Proposed Solution:** Provide context on why the feature is important and, if possible, some ideas or use cases illustrating the need.

4. **Engage in Discussion:** The community and maintainers may ask clarifying questions or request further detail.

Feature requests that align with project goals and community needs have a higher chance of being accepted and implemented.
