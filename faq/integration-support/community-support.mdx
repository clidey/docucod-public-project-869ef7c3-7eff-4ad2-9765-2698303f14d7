# Where can I get help or contribute to GoogleTest?

This page guides you to the primary support and communication channels for GoogleTest, outlines how to contribute, and points to GitHub repositories where you can raise issues or propose features. It is your authoritative resource for quick and effective assistance or getting involved in the development of GoogleTest.

## 1. Getting Help and Support

### Official Support Channels
- **GitHub Issues:** The primary platform for reporting bugs, requesting features, or asking questions is the [GoogleTest GitHub repository Issues page](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues). When posting, clearly describe your problem or suggestion with relevant reproduction steps or code.

- **Community Forums and Discussions:** Join discussions or seek help from fellow users and contributors on [GoogleTest Discussions](https://github.com/google/googletest/discussions). It’s a collaborative space for support and sharing insights.

- **Documentation:** The official documentation at [GoogleTest Documentation Site](https://google.github.io/googletest/) provides comprehensive guides, FAQs, API references, and troubleshooting tips. It's always best to consult this first to find answers quickly.

### Support Workflow
1. **Search Existing Resources:** Before reaching out, search GitHub issues and discussions and consult the documentation to see if your question or issue already exists.
2. **Raise an Issue or Discussion:** If not found, create a detailed issue or start a discussion.
3. **Engage with the Community:** Monitor responses and provide additional information if requested.

<Tip>
When reporting an issue, include environment details such as your platform, compiler version, relevant parts of your test code, and steps that reproduce the problem. This helps the community and maintainers diagnose and resolve issues faster.
</Tip>

## 2. How to Contribute

GoogleTest welcomes contributions from the community. Here’s a user-friendly guide to get started:

### Contribution Guidelines
- **Code Contributions:** Fork the [google/googletest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest), implement your changes following the style and quality conventions, and submit a pull request with a clear description.

- **Issues & Feature Requests:** Use the GitHub Issues tracker to report bugs or suggest new features. Provide as much detail as possible.

- **Documentation Improvements:** Documentation fixes or improvements are highly valuable. Propose enhancements via pull requests or discussions.

### Getting Started with Contributions
1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your personal fork on GitHub.
2. **Clone the Fork Locally:** Checkout your fork to work locally.
3. **Setup Development Environment:** Follow the [Installing with CMake](../getting-started/installation-and-configuration/installing-googletest-cmake) or [Platform-Specific Setup](../getting-started/installation-and-configuration/platform-specific-setup) guides.
4. **Make Your Changes:** Write clean, well-documented code and add tests where applicable.
5. **Run Tests:** Ensure all existing and new tests pass before submitting.
6. **Submit a Pull Request:** Clearly describe what your change does and reference any related issue.

<Tip>
Familiarize yourself with the [GoogleTest Code of Conduct](https://opensource.google.com/codeofconduct/) to align with community values and practices.

  - Use the "Issues" tab to open new tickets.
  - Label issues clearly (bug, feature, question) for faster triage.

- **Documentation Feedback:** Submit suggestions or corrections directly via pull requests or by opening issues in the GitHub repository.

## 4. Additional Communication Channels

Though GitHub is the definitive channel for code-related discussions and support, consider these options for broader community engagement:

- **Stack Overflow:** Tag your question with `googletest` or `gmock` on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest).
- **Mailing Lists or Google Groups:** If any official mailing discussions exist, they will be linked in the project’s README or documentation pages.

## 5. Best Practices for Getting Help

- Always verify you’re using the latest version of GoogleTest.
- Reproduce issues with minimal code examples.
- Include relevant error messages or stack traces.
- Provide platform, compiler, and GoogleTest version details.
- Clearly articulate your question or problem.
