# Platform Support & Compatibility Issues

GoogleTest supports an extensive range of compilers and operating systems, compliant with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This section helps you verify platform compatibility and addresses common environment-specific constraints.

---

## Supported Compilers and Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be portable and robust across major platforms including:

- **Linux** distributions, including popular variants like Ubuntu and Fedora.
- **Windows** (Desktop editions and variants such as MinGW and Windows Mobile).
- **Mac OS X** and **iOS**.
- **FreeBSD**, **OpenBSD**, **NetBSD**, **DragonFlyBSD**.
- Other *niche and embedded platforms* such as QNX, Haiku, Fuchsia, ESP32, and more.

It supports all modern C++ compilers that provide **C++17** capabilities, including:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) 7.0 and above
- MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio) 2017 Update 3 and above
- Clang with C++17 support
- Intel and other common compilers

## Known Platform Constraints

While GoogleTest aims for wide platform coverage, there are a few known limitations and behavioral differences depending on the environment:

### 1. Thread-Safety
- GoogleTest is **thread-safe on platforms that support pthreads**. This is the case on Linux, Mac, and many BSD variants.
- On Windows platforms, thread safety is provided except on **Windows Mobile** and other restricted editions.
- Users should not invoke GoogleTest assertions concurrently from multiple threads unless `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` is set to 1.

### 2. Exception Handling
- Compile-time detection of exception support is automatic but can be overridden.
- Some older or embedded compilers might disable exception support, which affects test behaviors. Use macro definitions to explicitly enable or disable exceptions as needed.

### 3. Regular Expressions
- GoogleTest uses **RE2** when compiled with Abseil (Absl). Otherwise, it defaults to POSIX regular expressions on supported Unix-like platforms.
- On platforms lacking POSIX regex support or where libraries are unavailable (e.g., Windows without Absl), GoogleTest uses a simple regex implementation.

### 4. File System Support
- GoogleTest requires a filesystem to support features such as death tests and output capturing.
- On embedded or mobile platforms that have no filesystem (e.g., ESP8266, certain Windows Mobile variants), some features like death tests and stream redirection are disabled.

### 5. Unicode and String Encoding
- Wide string (“std::wstring”) support varies; on Cygwin, Solaris, Android (Froyo and earlier), and certain embedded platforms it is unsupported.

### 6. Build Tools and Runtime Library Compatibility
- When integrating with build systems like CMake and Bazel, care must be taken to avoid runtime library conflicts, especially on Windows where static vs dynamic linking of CRTs can cause linker errors.
- GoogleTest provides configuration options (e.g., `gtest_force_shared_crt` in CMake) to harmonize runtime linkage.

## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

If you experience compilation errors, runtime crashes, or unexpected test behavior on your platform, consider the following:

### Check Compiler and Library Support

- Verify that your compiler supports **C++17** as it is required.
- Confirm that your build environment provides required libraries, such as pthreads or Abseil if used.
- Use compiler flags to explicitly enable or disable features (e.g., exceptions, pthread support):

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0
```

### Review GoogleTest Macros

GoogleTest offers user-overridable macros to adapt to platform constraints. Common macros include:

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` — Enable or disable pthread support.
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` — Control exception handling assumption.
- `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING` — Enable or disable wide string support.
- `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` — Enable capturing of stdout/stderr.
- `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY` and `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY` — Define when using GoogleTest as a shared library.

You can define these macros in your build scripts or via compiler flags to tailor the build.

### Validate Platform Macro Detection

- The internal header `gtest-port-arch.h` detects your operating system and architecture at compile time.
- If GoogleTest macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` or `GTEST_OS_LINUX` are not accurate, ensure your compiler defines the usual platform macros.

### Consult Platform-Specific Notes

- For Windows, ensure consistent use of static or dynamic CRT linkage to prevent linking errors.
- On embedded or limited environments (e.g., ESP32), expect reduced capabilities.

## Where to Find More Help

If problems persist, seek support from the following channels:

- **GitHub Issue Tracker:** Submit detailed bug reports or compatibility issues on the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
- **Community Forums:** Use the Google Test community groups and mailing lists to ask questions.
- **Documentation:** Review the following guides and FAQs:
  - [Getting Started Issues](https://yourdocs/faq/general-faq/getting-started-problems)
  - [Build System Integration (CMake, Bazel, etc.)](https://yourdocs/faq/integration-support/build-system-integration)
  - [Known Platform Limitations](https://yourdocs/docs/platforms.md)

## Best Practices for Platform Compatibility

- Use standard and widely supported compilers with up-to-date versions.
- When building on Windows, prefer using the CMake options that align runtime linkage.
- Validate macro settings explicitly in your build environment to avoid automatic misdetection.
- Test your GoogleTest integration early on your target platform to catch environment issues before scaling.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does GoogleTest work on embedded platforms like ESP32 or QNX?">
Yes, GoogleTest supports several embedded platforms, but some advanced features (e.g., death tests, stream capturing) may not function due to OS limitations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to handle linking errors related to CRT on Windows?">
Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align your runtime library linkage with your project’s settings, avoiding conflicts between static and dynamic CRT linkage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can GoogleTest disable exceptions or pthread support on unsupported platforms?">
Yes. You can disable exception handling or threading support by defining `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` respectively in your compiler flags.
</Accordion>

#### Troubleshooting Platform Issues

- Verify your compiler version and platform macros.
- Ensure threading libraries (pthread) are available if your tests rely on multi-threading.
- For Windows environments, confirm that Windows SDK and compiler settings are consistent with GoogleTest requirements.
- On mobile or embedded platforms, check for filesystem presence as GoogleTest depends on it for certain features.

Your understanding of platform support ensures you can build and run GoogleTest reliably in your environment. When in doubt, review the macros and environment flags defined during compilation via verbose build logs.
