# General FAQ: Product Purpose and Core Usage

This FAQ provides an overview of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, clarifying their distinct roles, main features, and how they empower developers to improve C++ testing practices. It explains the core problems these frameworks solve and illustrates their integration within typical developer workflows for building reliable and maintainable code.

## What are GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

- **GoogleTest (gTest)** is an open-source C++ testing framework designed to help developers write reliable and portable unit tests.
- **GoogleMock (gMock)** is an extension for GoogleTest that facilitates creating mock objects and controlling dependencies in tests.

Together, they provide a comprehensive testing ecosystem that supports both functional validation and interaction verification in C++ projects.

## What problems do GoogleTest and GoogleMock solve?

**GoogleTest:**
- Simplifies writing, organizing, and running unit tests with its rich assertion library and test discovery mechanisms.
- Offers testing patterns like test fixtures, parameterized, and typed tests that promote reusable, expressive test code.

**GoogleMock:**
- Enables defining mock classes with declarative syntax to simulate dependencies, isolate components, and verify interactions.
- Handles mocking for complex C++ features such as overloaded, templated, const, and noexcept methods.
- Provides powerful matchers and actions to specify detailed expectations about method calls, argument values, call counts, and sequences.

Together, they allow developers to:
- Validate code correctness at the unit level efficiently.
- Isolate components by mocking collaborators, reducing test fragility and speed.
- Verify the behavior of system parts under various scenarios including failures and edge cases.

## What are the core features of these frameworks?

### GoogleTest:
- **xUnit-style test organization:** Group tests into test suites and test fixtures.
- **Automatic test discovery and execution:** Run all or filtered tests with easy command-line controls.
- **Rich assertions and matchers:** Support for fatal/non-fatal failures, predicates, exceptions, floating-point comparisons, and more.
- **Parameterized & typed tests:** Run the same test logic against multiple data inputs or types.

### GoogleMock:
- **Mock class generation via `MOCK_METHOD` macros:** Quickly create mocks for interfaces or classes.
- **Flexible expectation syntax (`EXPECT_CALL`):** Specify how your mocks should be called, in which order, with what frequency.
- **Default behavior specification (`ON_CALL`):** Define default behaviors without enforcing call expectations.
- **Matchers:** Expressive and composable matching of arguments.
- **Actions:** Customizable behaviors including returning values, invoking callbacks, modifying arguments.
- **Strictness configurations:** Choose how mocks handle unexpected or uninteresting calls using `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, or the default (naggy).

## How do GoogleTest and GoogleMock fit into a developer’s typical workflow?

1. **Setup** your C++ project and integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock via CMake or your build system.
2. **Write tests with GoogleTest:** Use `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros to create unit tests and fixtures.
3. **Create mocks with GoogleMock:** Define mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros to simulate dependencies.
4. **Specify mock behavior and expectations:** Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` to set specific call expectations.
5. **Run tests:** Execute tests via your build system, inspecting output, logs, and test reports.
6. **Analyze failures or unexpected interactions:** GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide detailed diagnostics for failed assertions and mock violations.

This approach helps maintain code quality, detect regressions early, and facilitates confident refactoring.

## How does GoogleMock help improve test quality?

- Enables **interaction-based testing** by verifying that your code calls collaborators correctly.
- Reduces reliance on slow or flaky external resources by mocking dependencies.
- Facilitates testing error and edge cases by simulating failures or special behaviors.
- Supports fine-grained control of call order, argument matching, and call counts, making tests precise and meaningful.

## What are some common questions about these frameworks?

### Can GoogleMock mock non-virtual methods?
No, GoogleMock mocks virtual (or interface) methods. For non-virtual methods, alternative approaches like template-based dependency injection are recommended.

### What is the difference between `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL`?
- `EXPECT_CALL` sets an expectation that a method should be called and defines how it will behave.
- `ON_CALL` simply defines the default behavior but does not enforce any call expectations.

### What are `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`?
These are wrappers that change how mocks treat uninteresting calls:
- **NiceMock:** suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock:** warns on uninteresting calls (default behavior).
- **StrictMock:** treats uninteresting calls as failures.

Use them to balance verbosity and strictness in your tests.

### How do I mock overloaded methods?
GoogleMock supports mocking overloaded methods directly, but you may need to use casting helpers like `Const()` or specify types explicitly to disambiguate calls.

### Is GoogleMock compatible with complex C++ features?
Yes, GoogleMock supports mocking const, noexcept, and templated methods, as well as methods with complex argument types including move-only and smart pointers.

## Tips and best practices

- Define mock classes in public sections regardless of the access level of original methods.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set common default behavior, and `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify specific calls.
- Prefer `NiceMock` to reduce noisy warnings unless strict verification is needed.
- Use sequences and order clauses (`InSequence`, `After`) if call order matters.
- For parameterized tests, combine GoogleTest’s features to test multiple inputs cleanly.

## Where to learn more?

- **Getting Started and Installation:** Guides on setup basics and your first test.
- **Mocking Concepts and Tutorials:** `gmock_for_dummies.md`, `gmock_cook_book.md`, `gmock_cheat_sheet.md`, API references.
- **Advanced Testing Patterns:** Parameterized and typed tests, custom matchers, assertions.
- **Troubleshooting:** Common build and runtime issues.

<Tip>
Start your testing journey by writing simple GoogleTest unit tests and progressively introduce GoogleMock for interaction verification. Embrace best practices around expectations to maintain tests that are resilient and informative.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Remember that `EXPECT_CALL` statements should precede the code exercising the mocks to ensure correctness and proper verification.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use the default verbosity flags (e.g., `--gmock_verbose`) and test output settings to get improved diagnostics on mock call matching and failures.
