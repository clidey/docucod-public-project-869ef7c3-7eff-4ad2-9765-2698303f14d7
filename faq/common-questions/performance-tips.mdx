# Performance and Optimization Questions

This page addresses common user questions related to performance concerns in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses specifically on optimizing test suite execution speed, managing large numbers of tests efficiently, handling parameterized tests, and avoiding test design anti-patterns that degrade performance in large projects.

## Frequently Asked Questions on Performance

### Why are my tests running slowly?

Slow test execution is often caused by:

- **Expensive setup or teardown:** Tests that instantiate complex fixtures or perform heavy initialization repeatedly.
- **Excessive number of tests or subtests:** Running many tests or parameterized tests with large parameter sets.
- **Unnecessary resource contention:** Tests that interact with I/O, databases, or global/shared states.
- **Inefficient use of mocks or expectations:** Overly strict or numerous expectations increasing overhead.

**How to fix:**

- Use test fixtures to share setup/teardown for related tests, thus avoiding duplication.
- Limit the parameterized test cases to relevant sets or use filtering to reduce runs.
- Mock external resources to eliminate network or disk access.
- Avoid too fine-grained expectations; be concise in what you verify.

<Tip>
Profiling your test executions can point out bottlenecks — start with GoogleTest's built-in test timing information or use third-party profilers.
</Tip>

### How can I run many tests or parameterized tests efficiently?

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests that expand into multiple instantiations. For large projects, this can result in thousands of tests.

**Best Practices:**

- Use filters to run only affected tests when making changes.
- Group related tests logically using test suites.
- Use `--gtest_parallel` or integrate with parallel test runners when using build tools that support parallel execution.
- Avoid parameter sets that are unnecessarily large or combinatorial expansions that lead to explosion.
- Consider using typed or type-parameterized tests for generic code instead of massive parameter permutations.

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_filter` to restrict which tests run during development, saving time.
</Tip>

### How do I avoid common anti-patterns that hurt test performance?

**Common pitfalls:**

- Running the same expensive setup repeatedly in many tests instead of sharing via fixtures.
- Defining expectations on mocks that cause expensive computation or excessive logging.
- Creating too granular, fragile expectations which cause slow matching and high overhead.
- Excessive use of strict mocks that require detailed expectations on every call.

**Recommendations:**

- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default mock behavior and avoid unnecessary expectations.
- Prefer `NiceMock` over `NaggyMock` or `StrictMock` unless strictness is needed.
- Define minimal, meaningful expectations; do not over-specify.
- If a mock method is called frequently without much importance to the test, use `NiceMock` or suppress warnings.

<Tip>
Regularly review and refactor your test codebase to keep tests lean and focused.
</Tip>

### Can I measure and improve test execution time?

You can measure test execution time using GoogleTest’s `--gtest_output` with XML or by manually timing runs.

**Strategies to improve performance:**

- Profile and identify slow tests.
- Parallelize test runs where possible.
- Reuse expensive setup in test fixtures.
- Mock heavy dependencies to avoid slow I/O or computations.
- Avoid writing overly large or monolithic tests that try to cover too many checks.

## Practical Tips for Optimizing Large Test Suites

<Steps>
<Step title="Share Setup Using Fixtures">
Create a test fixture class by inheriting from `testing::Test` where expensive setup is done once per test instance, reducing duplication and speeding tests.
</Step>
<Step title="Limit Parameterized Test Cases">
Filter or reduce the number of parameter combinations used in parameterized tests to avoid combinatorial explosion.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Nice Mocks for Uninteresting Calls">
Wrap mock objects with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls and reduce overhead.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Default Actions Over Many Expectations">
Use `ON_CALL` to specify default mock behavior and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you specifically need to verify.
</Step>
<Step title="Filter Tests During Development">
Use `--gtest_filter` command line flag to run a subset of tests related to your current changes.
</Step>
<Step title="Parallel Test Execution">
Leverage parallel test runners or build tool support to run tests concurrently when possible.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Pitfalls & Gotchas

<AccordionGroup title="Performance Pain Points and How to Avoid Them">
<Accordion title="Repeated Expensive Setup">
Repetitive construction and destruction of heavy objects in each test slows the suite. To avoid, refactor code to share expensive resources in `SetUp()` and use proper fixtures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Overuse of Strict and Naggy Mocks">
Excessive strictness in mocks forces dense expectation definitions and verification, causing slowdowns and brittle tests. Use `NiceMock` to soften this as a default unless you need strict verification.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Large Parameter Sets in Parameterized Tests">
Massive expansions slow tests exponentially. Prefer smaller, focused parameter collections and split into multiple test suites if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Verbose Logging and Debug Output in Tests">
Excessive logging triggered by mocks or in test setup clogs output and wastes CPU cycles; adjust verbosity or limit output.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Slow or Inefficient Tests

<Steps>
<Step title="Check for Expensive Test Setup or Teardown">
Identify tests performing costly operations repeatedly. Move shared expensive setup to test fixtures’ `SetUpTestSuite` or use static resources.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Mock Strictness and Expectations">
Review mocks with many expectations or strict modes; uninteresting calls with warnings can degrade performance.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Tests with Filtering to Narrow Scope">
Verify if runtime improves significantly when running only a subset of tests, indicating heavy tests in the full suite.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Parallel Execution">
Try running tests in parallel (with external tools as GoogleTest itself does not run tests in parallel) to improve throughput.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Ensure your tests are independent and side-effect free to allow safe parallel execution.
</Tip>
