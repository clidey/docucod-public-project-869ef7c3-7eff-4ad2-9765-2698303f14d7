# Troubleshooting Test Failures & Errors

Comprehensive troubleshooting for resolving common errors encountered during test execution using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including assertion failures, unexpected test results, crashes, and mock-related issues. This documentation will help you diagnose test execution problems, death test complications, and correctly interpret framework output for actionable fixes.

---

## 1. Understanding Common Test Failures

### Assertion Failures
Assertion failures occur when the testâ€™s expected conditions are not met. Pay attention to the error messages which include:

- The line number where the failure happened
- The assertion used (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`)
- The actual vs expected values

**What to check:**

- Are the test inputs correct?
- Are the assertions too strict or mistyped?
- Is the code under test behaving as intended?

### Unknown or Unexpected Test Results

Tests may generate unknown results or unexpected output when:

- Mocks receive calls that don't match any `EXPECT_CALL`.
- There are unhandled exceptions thrown inside tests.
- Tests terminate early or terminate the process abnormally.

### Unexpected Crashes or Deaths

If a test crashes or fails a *death test*:

- Verify code under test and test fixture setups are not causing resource issues.
- Ensure death tests are correctly using `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH` macros.
- Confirm that preconditions for death tests are properly set.

### Misbehaving Mocks

Common mock-related issues arise when:

- Calls occur with unexpected arguments.
- Mocks receive calls with no matching expectations.
- Strictness settings cause warnings or failures on uninteresting calls.

---

## 2. Diagnosing Assertion Failures

### Reading Failure Messages

GoogleTest outputs clear messages on assertion failures, including the expression evaluated and values involved.

Example:

```text
path/to/test_file.cc:45: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  actual
  expected
  Which is: 5
Stack trace:
...
```

Use this information to:

- Locate the failing code quickly
- Check if the inputs or test setup are correct
- Adjust the assertions if they are too narrow or incorrect

### Common Pitfalls

- Using `ASSERT_*` inside loops without care can abort the rest of the test prematurely.
- Floating-point comparisons require tolerance with `EXPECT_NEAR` or matcher-based assertions.

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive test and assertion messages for clarity.
- Isolate failing cases to minimal reproducible scenarios.

---

## 3. Handling Unexpected Behaviors & Test Outcomes

### Unexpected Mock Calls

If a mock method is called but you get warnings or failures about unexpected calls:

- Check if you have set an `EXPECT_CALL` that matches the call.
- If the call is okay but not expected, add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` or use `NiceMock` to silence warnings.

**Understanding Uninteresting vs Unexpected calls:**

- *Uninteresting calls* have no expectations configured and by default generate warnings.
- *Unexpected calls* match some expectations but with unmatched arguments, causing failures.

### Debugging Tips

Run tests with verbose logging:

```bash
./test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This enables tracing of all mock function calls, showing which expectations were considered and matched.


### Exceptions in Tests

GoogleTest will catch unhandled exceptions and report failure with stack info.

- Verify your test or fixture setup doesn't throw.
- For exception testing, use `ASSERT_THROW` or `EXPECT_THROW`.

---

## 4. Troubleshooting Death Tests

Death tests verify that code terminates or crashes as expected.

### Common Issues

- Test hangs or runs infinitely
- False failures (test doesn't detect death)

### Recommendations

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH` macros correctly, with sufficient matching substrings.
- Ensure test code runs in a subprocess where death is isolated.
- Use `--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe` flag if using death tests in multi-threaded environments.

### Debugging Steps

- Run death tests standalone with verbose output.
- Check for race conditions or resource locks.

---

## 5. Mocking-Related Errors and Warnings

### Handling Uninteresting or Unexpected Calls

- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress warnings about uninteresting calls on a mock.
- Use `StrictMock<T>` to make uninteresting calls failures.
- Add catch-all expectations to allow certain calls without warnings:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### Ordering and Cardinality Failures

- Use sequences (`InSequence`) to enforce call order when necessary.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations once satisfied, avoiding saturation errors.
- Cardinalities like `Times(2)`, `AtLeast(1)`, `AnyNumber()` control expected call counts.

### Conflicts in Multiple Expectations

- Remember that newer (`EXPECT_CALL`) expectations override older ones.
- Order your expectations from general to specific, placing more specific last.

### Verbosity Control

Control how much mock information is displayed via `--gmock_verbose=` flag:

- `info`: show all mock calls with stack traces
- `warning`: show warnings and errors (default)
- `error`: only errors

For instance, to debug mismatch issues:

```bash
./test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

## 6. Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Procedure

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify Failure Type">
Determine if the failure is an assertion failure, unexpected crash, death test failure, or mock expectation issue.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Failure Output">
Read the test logs carefully, focusing on messages about assertion mismatches, unexpected calls, or stack traces.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Mock Setup">
Ensure all required expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) and default actions (`ON_CALL`) are correctly set, especially for mocks receiving calls.
</Step>
<Step title="Run with Verbose Logging">
Rerun with `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain insight into mock call matching and expectations evaluation.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Test Isolation and Setup">
Verify test fixture setup and teardown do not interfere or throw exceptions; isolate mock lifetimes properly.
</Step>
<Step title="For Death Tests: Validate Preconditions">
Ensure death tests use correct regex matching and run in the appropriate mode (`threadsafe` or `fast`).
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Fixes and Re-run">
Make necessary code or test corrections, then re-run tests to confirm resolution.
</Step>
<Step title="Seek Support if Needed">
Use community forums, official guides, and issue trackers if problems persist.
</Step>

## 7. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Set expectations *before* exercising mocks.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` to set default mock behavior, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for exact verification.
- Use `NiceMock<T>` for less noisy tests.
- Avoid overly strict expectations that cause brittle tests.
- Use sequences to enforce logical call orders but avoid excessive ordering that hinders refactoring.
- Clearly isolate test cases and mock scopes to prevent lifetime-induced issues.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` if mock objects may outlive test scope.

## 8. Common Issues & Solutions

### 8.1 Uninteresting Mock Function Call Warning
**Issue:** Warning about uninteresting calls when methods with no `EXPECT_CALL` are invoked.

**Solution:**
- Add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to silence warnings.
- Alternatively, wrap your mock in `NiceMock<>` to suppress warnings globally.

### 8.2 Unexpected Call Errors
**Issue:** Mock function called with unexpected arguments or at unexpected times.

**Solution:**
- Check the argument matchers in `EXPECT_CALL` for correctness.
- Use `_` wildcard or more relaxed matchers if exact matching is not needed.
- Add catch-all expectations for any other frequent calls.

### 8.3 Too Many or Too Few `WillOnce` Actions
**Issue:** Tests warn about mismatch between the number of calls and the number of `WillOnce` actions.

**Solution:**
- Use `.WillRepeatedly()` to specify behavior after all `WillOnce` actions are executed.
- Add `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to expectations to avoid sticky expectations causing upper-bound violations.

### 8.4 Death Test Fails or Hangs

**Solution:**
- Verify use of correct assertions (`EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH`)
- Confirm that death test code is isolated and runs in subprocess
- Use `--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe` if multi-threading causes problems.

### 8.5 Unexpected Test Termination

**Solution:**
- Look for code paths calling `abort()`, `exit()`, or segfaults.
- Run under debugger or memory sanitizer tools to identify crashes.

## 9. Understanding Framework Output

### Expected Call Output
When a mock call matches an expectation, detailed output shows:

```
Mock function call matches EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers))...
    Function call: Method(actual_args)
Stack trace:
...
```

Use this for verifying that expectations are evaluated correctly.

### Unexpected Call Output
Failure output lists all expectations tried and the reason they did not match.

### Uninteresting Calls
Warnings indicate calls to mock methods for which no expectation was set.

### Saturated Expectations
Indicates calls exceed the maximum specified in a `Times` clause.

<Check>
Remember: Always set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) before exercising your mocks. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors without expectations. Adjust mock strictness (NiceMock, StrictMock) to control how uninteresting calls are handled. Increase verbosity for deeper insight. Use sequences and cardinalities judiciously to avoid brittle tests.
