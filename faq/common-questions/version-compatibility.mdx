# What are the version requirements?

Understand GoogleTest’s C++ standard requirements and how to identify which versions are right for your project, as well as where to find changelogs before upgrading.

---

## Introduction

Before integrating GoogleTest into your C++ project, it is essential to understand the version requirements, particularly regarding the C++ standard, compiler versions, and compatibility considerations. This page guides you through these requirements so you can confidently select and upgrade GoogleTest versions that fit your environment and project goals.


## GoogleTest C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires a minimum of **C++17** support to build and function correctly. This requirement ensures usage of modern C++ features, improved safety, and consistent behavior across supported platforms.

- If your project is not yet using C++17 or later, you must upgrade your compiler and build environment to meet this prerequisite before adopting recent GoogleTest versions.
- To ensure compliance, configure your build system to specify C++17 explicitly (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang or appropriate MSVC flags).

> Practical tip: When using CMake, add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt` to enforce this:
>
> ```cmake
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
> set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
> ```


## Supported Compiler Versions

GoogleTest supports a variety of compilers meeting the C++17 standard requirement. Common recommended minimum versions include:

| Compiler             | Minimum Version      |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| GCC                  | 7.0+                 |
| Clang                | 3.4.1+               |
| MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio) | 2017 Update 3 (19.11)+ |

- These versions ensure full compatibility with GoogleTest’s features.
- Using newer versions enhances stability, build performance, and access to latest language improvements.


## Recommended Platform and Build System Considerations

GoogleTest aims to be portable across multiple platforms such as Linux, Windows, and Mac OS. However, careful attention to compiler and build tools is necessary:

- Ensure your build system supports C++17 properly.
- If leveraging package managers or submodules, verify that the GoogleTest version being pulled aligns with your compiler’s capabilities.
- If building from source, check GoogleTest’s [release notes](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) for any changes affecting compatibility.


## Identifying the Right GoogleTest Version

1. **Check Your Project Environment:**
   - Confirm compiler version and platform.
   - Confirm C++ standard in use.

2. **Review GoogleTest Release Notes:**
   - GoogleTest's releases document new requirements and feature changes.
   - The [release page](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) provides detailed changelogs.

3. **Choose a Version:**
   - For C++17 and later, use the latest stable release (currently, releases from version 1.10.0+).
   - For legacy environments, consider older versions but be aware they may lack new features or fixes.


## Where to Find Changelogs Before Upgrading

Before upgrading GoogleTest, reviewing changelogs is critical for smooth transitions and understanding any breaking changes:

- The official repository’s [Releases](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases) section contains detailed notes.
- Within the repository, the `CHANGES.md` or similarly named files summarize version-to-version differences.
- Also review the [Breaking Changes & Migration](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/changelog/breaking-migration) guides for major releases.


## Best Practices for Upgrading

- **Backup:** Always keep a backup of your current working version.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Run your entire test suite after upgrading to spot any regressions or incompatibilities.
- **Incremental Upgrades:** For large version gaps, upgrade incrementally through intermediate versions.
- **Review Release Notes:** Carefully read any notes about deprecated APIs, new flags, or required build changes.


## Troubleshooting Version Issues

If you encounter build or runtime problems related to version requirements:

- Verify your compiler supports C++17 (check with a simple C++17 program).
- Check that your build system respects the C++ standard flag and is consistent across all dependencies.
- Consult the [System Requirements](https://google.github.io/googletest/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) guide for environment specifics.
- Look for known incompatibility issues or patches in the GitHub issues or community forums.


## Summary

Understanding and meeting the version requirements of GoogleTest ensures robust integration, reliable testing, and access to its full feature set. By confirming C++17 support and verifying your compiler version, you lay the foundation for a successful testing setup.

## Example: Enforcing C++17 in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTestProject)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add GoogleTest as a subdirectory or via FetchContent
add_subdirectory(googletest)

target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```


<Tip>
Always align your project's C++ standard version with GoogleTest’s minimum requirements to avoid subtle issues during build or test execution.
</Tip>


<Warning>
Attempting to build GoogleTest with a compiler that lacks full C++17 support will fail at compile time, often with obscure errors. Upgrade your compiler or adjust the GoogleTest version accordingly.
</Warning>

## How GoogleTest Fits Into Your Project Documentation

This page focuses on the **version compatibility** aspect within the broader GoogleTest ecosystem:

- It complements **Installation and Setup** guides that cover how to get GoogleTest into your project.
- Precedes workflow documentation like **Writing First Tests** or **Mocking API** by ensuring users have a compatible environment.
- Assists users who encounter setup failures due to environment mismatch.

By thoroughly understanding and adhering to the version requirements here, users can confidently build upon later guides and fully leverage GoogleTest’s powerful testing capabilities.
