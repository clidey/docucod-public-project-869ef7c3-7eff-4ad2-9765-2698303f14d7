# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

GoogleTest is designed as a portable, robust C++ testing and mocking framework supporting a broad range of platforms and compilers. This page details the officially supported operating systems, compiler versions, threading capabilities, and tooling requirements, enabling you to confidently plan your testing workflow and avoid preventable integration issues.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of platforms commonly used in industry and open source development. Here are the officially supported operating systems:

- **Linux** (multiple distributions)
- **Windows** (including Desktop, MinGW, Windows Store, Windows Phone, and Mobile variants)
- **macOS**
- **FreeBSD**
- **OpenBSD**
- **NetBSD**
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **Cygwin**
- **GNU Hurd**
- **GNU/kFreeBSD**
- **DragonFly BSD**
- **Haiku**
- **QNX**
- **z/OS**
- **Fuchsia**
- **Embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, NXP QN9090, NRF52, XTENSA, QuRT**

> Platforms like Fuchsia are supported but not officially maintained in all aspects.

For detailed OS detection, GoogleTest internally uses the `GTEST_OS_*` macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`), automatically defined during compilation to enable appropriate platform-specific behavior.

## Supported Compiler Versions

To build and run GoogleTest effectively, an environment supporting at least **C++17** is required. Supported compilers include:

- **GCC** 7.0 and above
- **Clang** 3.4.1 and above
- **Microsoft Visual C++** 2017 Update 3 (MSVC >= 19.11)
- **Intel C++ Compiler:** Compatible versions supporting C++17 features
- **SunPro (Oracle Solaris Studio)**: recent versions with C++17 support
- **IBM VisualAge C++** 9.0 or later
- **HP aCC**: compilers supporting C++17

Older compilers lacking C++17 support are not compatible.

GoogleTest detects compiler capabilities such as:

- Exception support
- Runtime Type Information (RTTI)
- Threading and synchronization primitives

and adapts internally with corresponding macros like `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`, and `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`.

## Threading and Concurrency Support

GoogleTest is designed to be thread-safe on platforms where appropriate threading primitives are available.

- On Unix-like platforms, GoogleTest detects `pthread` availability and enables thread safety (flag `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`).
- On Windows Desktop, native Windows threading APIs are used.
- On some embedded or mobile platforms (e.g., Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, embedded RTOS like QuRT), threading support is limited or unavailable.

By default, GoogleTest attempts to auto-detect threading availability.
You can override this detection by defining the `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` build macro to 1 or 0.

If you use GoogleTest in a multi-threaded environment, ensure your platform has pthread or native threading support and that the corresponding macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` evaluates to 1.

## C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires a compiler environment that supports **C++17** features. If your build system does not specify the C++ standard, you may need to add flags manually (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang or `/std:c++17` for MSVC).

The C++17 requirement enables GoogleTest to use language features for improved safety, portability, and maintainability.

## Build Tools and Build System Integration

GoogleTest supports several popular build systems:

- **CMake**
  - GoogleTest provides CMake scripts that build both GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
  - Minimum required CMake version: 3.14 for FetchContent and `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()` functionality.
  - Recommended usage patterns include standalone projects, integration via `add_subdirectory()`, or FetchContent-based downloading.

- **Bazel**
  - Full Bazel build files are provided.
  - The build rules support platform and compiler-specific flags and dependencies.

- Support for manual or legacy build tools depends on configuring compiler and linker flags to accommodate threading and platform detection macros.

## Common Issues Related to Platform Support

- **Threading Detection Fails:** Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `=0` explicitly to force correct detection.
- **RTTI or Exceptions Disabled:** Check your compiler settings if GoogleTest reports missing RTTI or exceptions.
- **Unsupported Platforms:** GoogleTest may compile but lack some features or fail at runtime.

## Tips for Ensuring Compatibility

- Always use a supported compiler version with full C++17 support.
- Confirm your OS platform is among the supported list.
- Use the provided CMake or Bazel build files to prevent missing required flags or incorrectly set macros.
- For unsupported embedded platforms, consider customizing GoogleTest via `custom/gtest-port.h` as documented.

## Customization and User Overrides

GoogleTest exposes several customization points to adapt platform-specific behavior:

- Defining custom macros in `custom/gtest-port.h`.
- Overriding platform-specific implementations if necessary.

Refer to [Customization Points](googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md) for advanced integration needs.
