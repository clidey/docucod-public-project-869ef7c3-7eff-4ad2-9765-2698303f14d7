# Supported Platforms and Compilers for GoogleTest and GoogleMock

This page details the supported C++ standards, compilers, and operating systems for successful usage of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Understanding this compatibility ensures smooth installation, build, and test execution without platform-specific issues.

---

## 1. Overview of Supported Platforms

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Below are the primary aspects of platform support:

- **Operating Systems**
  - Linux (including Android)
  - macOS and iOS
  - Windows (Desktop editions, MinGW, Windows Mobile, and related variants)
  - BSD variants (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
  - Other Unix-like systems: Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, QNX
  - Embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52 with some limitations

- **Compilers**
  - GCC versions supporting C++17
  - Clang versions supporting C++17
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.3) or later
  - Other compilers supporting the C++17 standard

- **C++ Standard**
  - GoogleTest requires **C++17** or later to build and operate correctly.

## 2. Operating System Compatibility Details

| Platform        | Notes                                                                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**       | Full support including desktop and server distributions. Also supports Linux Android variants. |
| **Windows**     | Supported with variations for Desktop, Mobile, and CMake integration. Requires MSVC 2017+.     |
| **macOS / iOS** | Supported with Xcode; macOS typically uses CMake for builds.                                  |
| **BSD Systems** | FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD supported, but users may need to verify pthread support. |
| **Others**      | Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and QNX supported with some platform-specific conditions.                |
| **Embedded**    | ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52 supported. Some system calls, file systems, and threading features may be limited. |

### Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Threading**: GoogleTest depends on pthreads where available for thread safety and death test support.
- **File System**: Platforms must provide file system support for file I/O; embedded systems without file systems may have limited functionality.
- **Death tests**: Supported on platforms that allow process forking or spawning and have filesystem support.

<Info>
On Windows with Visual Studio, ensure that the runtime library linkage matches GoogleTest's settings to avoid linker errors. Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align runtime linkage.

## 3. Compiler Requirements

### Minimum Supported Versions and Features

- **C++17 Support** is mandatory. Users must enable this standard explicitly if their projects default to older standards.

- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**
  - Minimum: Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC Version 14.16, _MSC_VER >= 1911)
  - Required to compile GoogleMock as well.

- **GCC**
  - Versions that fully support C++17 (generally GCC 7 and later).

- **Clang**
  - Versions supporting C++17 (Clang 5.0 or later is recommended).

- **Other compilers**
  - Must comply with C++17, including support for exceptions, RTTI, and threading to some extent.

### CMake Version

- GoogleTest requires **CMake 3.14 or newer** to use the recommended `FetchContent_MakeAvailable()` approach.


<Note>
Building GoogleMock, which extends GoogleTest, additionally requires MSVC 2015 or later.
</Note>

## 4. Threading and Library Support

- **Pthreads**
  - GoogleTest automatically detects pthread availability.
  - Users can force pthread support with the compiler flag `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or disable with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0`.
  - On platforms without pthreads (e.g., some embedded), GoogleTest operates single-threaded with degraded functionality.

- **Exceptions and RTTI**
  - GoogleTest detects whether exceptions and Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) are enabled.
  - Some features such as typed tests require RTTI.

- **Shared Libraries**
  - GoogleTest and GoogleMock can be built as static or shared libraries.
  - On Windows, runtime linkage mismatch errors are common; use CMake options to control linkage.

---

## 5. Platform-Specific and Build Notes

### Windows

- Visual Studio project files (`.sln`, `.vcproj`) are generated by CMake.
- By default, runtime libraries are linked statically; conflicts arise if your project uses dynamic linkage.
- Use `cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to align GoogleTest runtime with your project.

### macOS

- Xcode project files can be generated by CMake.
- Make sure to use a modern compiler supporting C++17.

### Linux

- Typical `make` flow after CMake generation.
- Pthread flags are handled automatically by GoogleTest's CMake.

### Embedded Platforms

- Some GoogleTest capabilities (e.g., file system operations, environment variables) might be limited.
- Threading support depends on platform.
- Refer to the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) for more details.

## 6. Verification and Troubleshooting

### Verifying Setup

- Confirm compiler compatibility:

```bash
<compiler> --version
# or
clang++ --version
```

- Verify C++17 is enabled (often `-std=c++17` or equivalent).

- Check CMake version:

```bash
cmake --version
```

- Run sample GoogleTest examples following the [Quick Validation & Sample Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/configuration-initial-run/quick-validation.md) guide.

### Common Issues

- **Linker errors on Windows** due to runtime library mismatch: use `gtest_force_shared_crt` option.

- **Compilation errors due to lacking C++17**: explicitly enable the correct standard in your build.

- **Missing pthreads**: manually add pthread linkage if you use custom build scripts.

- **Unsupported platforms or embedded targets**: refer to platform documentation and consider disabling non-supported features.

## 8. Best Practices

- Always verify compiler and CMake versions before starting.
- Use GoogleTest’s provided CMake scripts for consistent build experience.
- For Windows users, pay attention to runtime library linkage settings for MSVC.
- On unsupported or embedded platforms, verify which GoogleTest features are functional.
- Reference official GoogleTest platform support tables and documentation regularly.
