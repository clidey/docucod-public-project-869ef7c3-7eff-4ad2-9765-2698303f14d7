# Using GoogleTest and GoogleMock Features FAQ

This FAQ provides clear, practical answers to common questions users have about utilizing GoogleTest and GoogleMock's core and advanced features. It focuses specifically on how to effectively use assertions, parameterized tests, mocking, and test management tools to write robust, maintainable tests in standard C++ workflows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Assertions

**Q: What is the difference between `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*` assertions?**

A: `ASSERT_*` assertions generate a fatal failure and immediately abort the current test function, stopping further execution in that test. Use them when it makes no sense to continue after a failure (e.g., when required preconditions fail). `EXPECT_*` assertions generate non-fatal failures, allowing the test to continue and report multiple failures at once. Typically `EXPECT_*` is preferred for thorough testing.

---

**Q: How do I provide custom failure messages with assertions?**

A: Stream your message using the `<<` operator at the end of an assertion. For example:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors differ in length.";
EXPECT_EQ(x[i], y[i]) << "Mismatch at index " << i;
```

Messages augment GoogleTest's output with precise debug info.

### Using Parameterized Tests

**Q: How can I write tests that run the same logic with different input values?**

A: Use parameterized tests by defining a test fixture that inherits from `::testing::TestWithParam<ParamType>`, then instantiate test cases with values or types. This allows compact, scalable testing of multiple scenarios without code duplication.

For example:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, WorksForVariousValues) {
  int input = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(FunctionUnderTest(input));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyInst, MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

---

### Mocking

**Q: How do I define a mock class using GoogleMock?**

A: Derive a class from the interface you want to mock and use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro in the `public` section to declare mocked methods. For example:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (int n), (override));
};
```

Remember that methods must be virtual in the interface and that `MOCK_METHOD` must be public even if overriding protected or private methods.

---

**Q: How do I control the behavior of mock methods?**

A: Use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior (called whenever the method is invoked without expectation) and `EXPECT_CALL` to set call expectations with specified behavior and verification. Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, GetSize()).WillByDefault(Return(10));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething(5)).Times(1).WillOnce(Return());
```

Use `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` to verify interactions.

---

**Q: What are NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock? When should I use them?**

A: These are wrappers to control uninteresting calls (calls to mock methods without matching expectations):

- `NiceMock` suppresses warnings about uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock` (default behavior) prints warnings for uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as errors, failing the test.

Use **NiceMock** for less noisy output during stable tests, **NaggyMock** while writing or debugging tests, and **StrictMock** to enforce strict interaction rules mostly in tighter verification scenarios.

---

**Q: How do I specify argument matchers for mock method calls?**

A: GoogleMock provides built-in argument matchers such as `_` (match anything), `Eq(value)`, `Ge(value)`, `NotNull()`, and many others. Use them within `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to precisely specify expected argument patterns, e.g.: 

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Ge(10), _));
```

You can combine matchers logically with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and create custom matchers for complex scenarios.

---

**Q: How do I set the order of expected calls?**

A: Use the `InSequence` helper to enforce that expectations occur in the declared order. For partial ordering or complex sequences, use `EXPECT_CALL`'s `After()` and sequence objects:

```cpp
{
  ::testing::InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

Calls must happen in order, or the test fails.

---

### Test Management

**Q: How does GoogleTest discover and run tests?**

A: Tests are registered automatically when you use `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros. Running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in `main()` runs all registered tests. You can filter which tests to run using the `--gtest_filter` command line flag.

---

**Q: Can I control the number of times a mocked method is expected to be called?**

A: Yes. Use `.Times()` clause with built-in cardinalities like `Exactly(n)`, `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)`, `AnyNumber()`, or specify 0 to disallow calls.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).Times(Exactly(2));
```

---

**Q: How do I specify multiple actions for a mock method call?**

A: Use `DoAll()` to combine several actions. The return value of the last action is used as the return value. For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Mutate(_))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<0>(5), Return(true)));
```

---

## Common Issues & Best Practices

- Set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) *before* exercising the code that triggers the mock.
- Use `ON_CALL` for setting default mock behaviors without enforcing calls.
- Be cautious when returning references; prefer `ReturnRef()` instead of `Return()`.
- Avoid over-specifying mocks which leads to brittle tests. Test what really matters.
- When mocking non-virtual methods, consider interface adaptation or template injection.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Uninteresting mocks warnings?** Wrap mock objects in `NiceMock` or add a catch-all expectation with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- **Unexpected calls failing tests?** Check argument matchers carefully, and adjust expectations to allow permissible calls.
- **Test crashes or segfaults?** Check use of `ASSERT_*` macros carefullyâ€”failing `ASSERT_*` aborts immediately, so ensure clean-up.
- **Slow compilation?** Move mock class constructors and destructors definitions out of header to `.cc` file.
