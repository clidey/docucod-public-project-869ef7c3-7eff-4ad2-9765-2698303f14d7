# What is GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock together form Google's comprehensive, platform-independent **C++ testing and mocking framework** designed to help developers write reliable and maintainable tests for their C++ codebases. This page introduces their core purpose, primary features, and typical scenarios where they shine, helping you decide if they match your project's testing needs.

## Understanding GoogleTest

GoogleTest is a feature-rich, open-source **testing framework** for C++ designed with portability, ease-of-use, and robustness in mind. It supports the full spectrum of testing types beyond just unit tests, suitable for any kind of automated test you want to write in C++.

### Why Choose GoogleTest?

- **Independence & Repeatability:** GoogleTest runs each test independently, eliminating flaky tests caused by shared state or order dependencies, and making debugging faster and more straightforward.
- **Logical Organization:** Tests are grouped into *test suites* that mirror your code structure, making it easier to maintain and understand tests as your code grows.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works seamlessly across Linux, Windows, and Mac, supporting various compiler setups, with or without exceptions.
- **Informative Failures:** When a test fails, GoogleTest provides detailed diagnostics, including source location and context, without stopping at the first failure. Non-fatal failure reporting aids in catching multiple bugs in a single run.
- **Automation-Friendly:** Automatically discovers and runs all defined tests without requiring manual registration.
- **Fast Execution:** Supports sharing expensive resources across tests, minimizing setup/teardown overhead.

### Core Concepts

- **Assertions:** Statements that verify conditions; they can fail fatally (abort current function) or non-fatally (allow test continuation).
- **Tests:** Functions that contain assertions to verify code behavior; if any assertion fails fatally or the test crashes, the test fails.
- **Test Suites:** Logical groupings of tests that resemble the structure of the code under test.
- **Test Fixtures:** Classes that allow sharing setup and teardown code and common objects between multiple tests within a test suite.

### Typical Workflow

1. **Write assertions** in test functions using macros like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc., to verify your code’s behavior.
2. **Group related tests** into test suites using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
3. Optionally, create **test fixtures** by deriving from `testing::Test` to share setup among multiple tests.
4. Run your tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which reports success/failure via return codes.

### Example

```c++
// Simple function under test.
int Factorial(int n);

// Tests factorial of 0.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

// Tests factorial of positive numbers.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

This example clearly groups related tests and uses assertions that output detailed error info if they fail.

## Understanding GoogleMock

GoogleMock is a powerful **mocking framework** built on top of GoogleTest, allowing you to create mock objects and set expectations to simulate and verify interactions in complex C++ codebases.

While this page focuses on the overview and use cases, GoogleMock tightly integrates with GoogleTest, enabling you to define mock classes and methods with macros, specify expected calls (`EXPECT_CALL`), and control their behavior with argument matchers and actions.

### Who Should Use GoogleMock?

- Developers writing tests for classes or components interacting with complex dependencies.
- Teams wanting to isolate units under test by mocking external interfaces.
- Projects requiring strict enforcement of expected method calls and arguments.

---

## When to Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock

### GoogleTest is ideal when you want to:

- Write **unit** or **integration tests** for C++ code.
- Make running tests automatic and consistent across platforms.
- Gain **detailed diagnostics** on test failures.
- Organize tests in suites and use fixtures for reusable setups.
- Leverage advanced features like parameterized, value-parameterized, and typed tests.

### GoogleMock is ideal when you want to:

- Test code that depends on **external components, interfaces, or hardware** without requiring the actual dependencies.
- Verify that your code **interacts correctly** with collaborators: method calls, call order, number of invocations, etc.
- Test asynchronous or event-driven code by controlling mock behavior precisely.

## Getting Started and Integration

- Include `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` for GoogleTest functionality.
- Include `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` when using GoogleMock.
- Write tests using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and for parameterized scenarios use `TEST_P()`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`.
- Define mocks extending interfaces and use `EXPECT_CALL` to set expectations.
- Initialize and run tests with `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv); return RUN_ALL_TESTS();` in `main()`.

For detailed introductory material, start with the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html), followed by the [Testing Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/testing.md). For mocking, explore the [GoogleMock README](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googlemock) and guides.
