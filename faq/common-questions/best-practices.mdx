# Recommended Coding and Testing Practices

This page provides clear, actionable best practices for writing effective, maintainable tests and mocks using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses on organizing tests, naming conventions, and leveraging framework features to enhance clarity and robustness.

---

## 1. Writing Clear and Maintainable Tests

### Organize Tests Logically
- Group related tests into test suites (`TEST_F`) to share setup and teardown code.
- Use descriptive test case and test names that communicate the intent clearly.
- Avoid testing multiple concepts in a single test. One test should verify one behavior or property.

### Naming Tests
- Use descriptive, human-readable names reflecting what the test verifies.
- Consider naming conventions such as `<Functionality>_<Condition>_<ExpectedResult>`.
- Name mocks similarly, emphasizing the interface or class they mock, e.g., `MockTurtle`.

### Test Independence
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order.
- Use fixtures (`SetUp()` and `TearDown()`) to isolate side effects.

<Tip>
Consistency in test organization and naming leads to easier maintenance and quicker onboarding for new team members.
</Tip>

## 2. Best Practices for Using GoogleMock

### Defining Robust Mock Classes
- Always define mock methods in the `public:` section regardless of the base class method's access level.
- Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro consistently with proper specifiers like `(override)`, `(const, override)`, or `Calltype(...)` when needed.
- For methods with template or complex arguments containing commas, use parentheses or type aliases to avoid parsing issues.

### Using NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock
- By default, mocks generate warnings on uninteresting calls (naggy behavior).
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings if uninteresting calls are expected and intentional.
- Use `StrictMock` to treat unexpected or uninteresting calls as errors, enforcing stricter test contracts.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;    // Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;  // Fails tests on uninteresting or unexpected calls.
```

- Choose the appropriate strictness mode to balance test brittleness and fault detection.

### Setting Expectations Effectively
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set explicit expectations for method calls.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior without enforcing call expectations.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations that constrain the code unnecessarily, leading to brittle tests.
- Use cardinality like `Times(AnyNumber())`, `Times(AtLeast(n))` judiciously.

### Ordering and Sequencing Calls
- By default, method call expectations are order-independent.
- Use `InSequence` or `.InSequence()` to enforce strict call order.
- Use `.After()` or partial order sequences to handle complex call dependencies.

---

## 3. Tips and Common Pitfalls

### Expectation Setting Before Use
- Always set `EXPECT_CALL`s before exercising the mock.
- Setting or changing expectations after mock use leads to undefined behavior.

### Mock Object Lifetimes
- Confirm mock objects are properly destroyed so expectations are verified.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to force verification early, when necessary.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional leaks are necessary to avoid false failures.

### Avoid Over-Mocking
- Prefer coding to interfaces rather than mocking concrete classes directly.
- Over-mocking concrete classes can cause fragile tests tightly coupled to implementation.

### Handling Overloaded Methods
- Mock all overloaded variants or bring originals into scope using `using Base::Method;` to avoid compiler warnings.

### Using Delegation
- For complex mocks, delegate calls to a real object or fake to preserve default behavior while allowing expectation verification.

## 4. Leveraging GoogleMock Features

### Actions and Matchers
- Use matchers like `_`, `Eq()`, `Ge()`, and custom matchers to specify flexible argument expectations.
- Combine matchers for complex conditions using `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()`.

### Default Actions
- Use `ON_CALL` with `WillByDefault()` to define default mock behavior.
- Use `Return()`, `ReturnRef()`, `ReturnPointee()` for returning values from mocks.

### Sequencing Multiple Returns
- Use multiple `WillOnce()` clauses followed by `WillRepeatedly()` for return sequences.

### Side Effects and Argument Manipulation
- Use actions like `SetArgPointee()`, `SetArrayArgument()`, and `DoAll()` to handle output parameters and side effects in mocks.

### Controlling Verbosity
- Control warnings and informational messages with the `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning` (default), `error`).

---

## 5. Troubleshooting and Debugging

### Diagnosing Expectation Failures
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs of calls and matchings.
- Analyze mismatch messages and stack traces to correct expectation settings.

### Handling Unexpected Calls
- Ensure all expected calls are set properly.
- Add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly allow unexpected calls.

### Compilation Issues
- For compilation slowdowns, move mock class constructor and destructor definitions to `.cc` files.
- Avoid problems with MSVC warnings by removing meaningless `const` qualifiers from function parameters.

## Practical Example: Using NiceMock

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetId, (), ());
};

void TestFunction() {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;
  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));

  // Only interested in Connect(), ignore uninteresting calls gracefully.
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect());

  // Code under test...
  mock_db.Connect();
  mock_db.GetId();  // No warning due to NiceMock
}
```

## Summary

Following these recommended practices ensures your tests are reliable, clear, and maintainable. Use appropriate mock strictness to balance test robustness and ease of development. Organize and name tests thoughtfully, leverage GoogleMock's powerful features, and troubleshoot effectively using the provided tips and diagnostics.

## Callouts

<Warning>
Avoid setting expectations after mock objects have been used. Doing so leads to undefined behavior and unpredictable test outcomes.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use `NiceMock` for mocks you do not want to be warned about on uninteresting calls, especially for dependencies that are incidental to the test's focus.
</Tip>

<Note>
Always code to interfaces rather than directly mocking concrete classes to promote test stability and better software design.
</Note>
