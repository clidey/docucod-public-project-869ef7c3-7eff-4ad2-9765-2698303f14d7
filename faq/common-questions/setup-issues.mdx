# Solving Setup & Build Issues

GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer powerful C++ testing capabilities, but ensuring a smooth setup and build process can sometimes pose challenges. This page addresses the most common issues encountered when integrating GoogleTest or GoogleMock into your projects, including linking errors, header file resolution, and configuration pitfalls across CMake, Bazel, and compiler compatibility.

---

## 1. Common Setup Problems

### 1.1 Linking Errors

**Problem:** You encounter linker errors such as "undefined reference" to GoogleTest or GoogleMock symbols.

**Cause:**
- The GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries are not correctly linked.
- Mismatch between static/dynamic linking modes.
- Runtime library conflicts, such as static vs dynamic CRT in Visual Studio.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your build system links against the correct libraries (e.g., `gtest_main`, `gmock_main`, or `gtest`, `gmock`).
- For CMake, prefer linking with imported targets like `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gtest_main`.
- If using Visual Studio, set the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to match your projectâ€™s runtime library setting:

```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "")
```

- Confirm that GoogleTest is built with the same compiler, and runtime options as your test code to avoid ABI mismatches.

---

### 1.2 Header File Not Found

**Problem:** Build fails with errors like `fatal error: gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory`.

**Cause:**
- Include directories are missing or incorrectly specified.
- GoogleTest source or installed headers are not visible to your compilation unit.

**Solution:**
- Verify you have added the GoogleTest include paths properly.
  - For CMake, using `FetchContent` or `find_package` ensures includes are set up automatically.
- If embedding GoogleTest source code, add its root directory as an include path.
- When using Bazel, make sure the `cc_test` or `cc_binary` `deps` contain GoogleTest targets.

---

### 1.3 Compiler Compatibility Issues

**Problem:** Compilation warnings or errors related to C++ version or language features.

**Cause:**
- GoogleTest requires C++17 or newer.
- Inappropriate or mismatched compiler flags.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your project is compiled with at least C++17 support. For CMake, add:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- Use consistent compiler flags between your code and GoogleTest.
- If you encounter platform-specific issues, check the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) document for known limitations.

## 2. Troubleshooting CMake Builds

### 2.1 Standalone GoogleTest Build

If you build GoogleTest as a standalone project, the steps should be:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
mkdir googletest/build && cd googletest/build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install  # Optional to install system-wide
```

If you want to disable GoogleMock, use:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
```

Make sure to build with a compatible compiler and flags.

### 2.2 Embedding GoogleTest in Your Project

Use one of these common integration approaches:

- Add GoogleTest source as a subdirectory:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(googletest)
```

- Use `FetchContent` in CMake to download and configure during the build:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)
```

Ensure your test target links to GoogleTest properly:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_test_target gtest_main)
```

### 2.3 Common Pitfalls and Fixes

- **Mismatch of Runtime Libraries on Windows:** Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to harmonize runtime linkage.
- **Macros Conflicts:** If GoogleTest macros like `TEST` conflict with other libraries, define `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` and use the `GTEST_TEST` macro instead.

---

## 3. Troubleshooting Bazel Builds

- Ensure your `BUILD` files correctly reference Google's testing targets, usually via `@com_google_googletest//:gtest`
- Your `cc_test` targets must include appropriate `deps` on GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Bazel automatically handles include paths for these dependencies.

If you face linking or missing headers:
- Check your workspace and `WORKSPACE` file have GoogleTest/Bazel rules correctly imported.
- Run `bazel clean` to reset build state.

---

## 4. Frequently Encountered Configuration Issues

### 4.1 C++17 Requirement

GoogleTest mandates C++17 support. Failure to meet this causes cryptic compiler errors.

### 4.2 Exception Handling

GoogleTest checks for exception support (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) at compile time. If your compiler disables exceptions, GoogleTest will adapt, but many features might not work as expected.

### 4.3 Threading and Synchronization

GoogleTest automatically detects pthread availability and threading support. For cross-platform consistency, confirm your build environment correctly detects threading features.

---

## 5. Verifying Your Setup

After building and linking, write a minimal test to verify:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and run this test executable. Success here confirms that GoogleTest is correctly set up.

---

## 6. Additional Tips

- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before running tests to ensure flag parsing.
- If you write a custom main, verify you return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to propagate test failures.
- Review the "/getting-started/setup-installation/prerequisites-requirements" and "/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-cmake-bazel" guides for environment-specific setup assistance.
