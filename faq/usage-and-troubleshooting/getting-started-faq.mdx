# Getting Started & Basic Usage FAQ

This FAQ answers your most common questions about installing, configuring, and writing your first tests with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It provides practical advice to help you jump in quickly, resolve setup issues, and highlights essential beginner resources.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Installation and Setup

**Q1: How do I install GoogleTest and GoogleMock on my platform?**  
A1: Use platform-specific package managers if available, or build from source using CMake. For cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows), follow the detailed steps in the [Installation Instructions (All Platforms)](/getting-started/setup-overview/installation-multi-platform).  

**Q2: What are the prerequisites before installing?**  
A2: Ensure your system meets the requirements for OS, compiler version (supporting C++17), and build tools like CMake. See [Prerequisites and System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-overview/system-prerequisites) for exact details.

**Q3: How do I verify that installation was successful?**  
A3: Compile and run a basic test binary using provided examples or your own simple test. Refer to [Quick Validation and Sanity Check](/getting-started/first-test-run/quick-validation) for verification steps and interpreting test output.

### Writing Your First Test

**Q4: How do I write a simple unit test with GoogleTest?**  
A4: Use the `TEST()` macro to create a test case. Within the test, use assertions like `EXPECT_EQ` to verify conditions. For example:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

See the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md#simple-tests) for comprehensive guidance.

**Q5: When should I use TEST_F() instead of TEST()?**  
A5: Use `TEST_F()` when multiple tests share common setup data or subroutines, defined in a test fixture class derived from `testing::Test`. This facilitates reusing test data and code. Learn more at [Test Fixtures](primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests).

**Q6: Do I need to write my own `main()` function to run tests?**  
A6: Usually not. Linking with `gtest_main` provides a default `main()` that initializes and runs all tests. Write your own `main()` only for custom pre-test setup. See details in [Writing the main() Function](primer.md#writing-the-main-function).

### Configuring Test Runs

**Q7: How do I run all the tests I've defined?**  
A7: Call the macro `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your test’s `main()` function. It executes all registered tests and returns `0` if all succeed or `1` otherwise. Don’t ignore its return value.

**Q8: Can I run specific tests or filter tests?**  
A8: Use command-line flags when executing your test binary to select or exclude tests by name. Refer to the Advanced Guide and `--gtest_filter` option.

### Using GoogleMock (gMock)

**Q9: How does GoogleMock integrate with GoogleTest?**  
A9: gMock is bundled with GoogleTest and provides tools for creating mock classes and setting expectations. Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros and `EXPECT_CALL`s within your tests to specify mock behavior and verify interactions. See the beginner-friendly [gMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md).

**Q10: What’s the best practice for setting expectations on mock methods?**  
A10: Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors without imposing expectations, and use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify that a method is called with particular arguments or number of times. This keeps tests both expressive and maintainable.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Q11: My tests aren’t running or linking correctly. What can I do?**  
A11: Verify compiler compatibility (must support C++17), ensure correct linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries, and double-check build system setup (especially if using CMake). See [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/troubleshooting-getting-started/common-setup-issues).

**Q12: GoogleMock gives warnings about uninteresting calls. How to handle them?**  
A12: Uninteresting calls happen when a mock method is called without an explicit expectation. You can suppress these warnings by using `NiceMock` wrappers or by adding an `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to allow those calls.

**Q13: I get compiler errors mocking methods with commas in signatures. How to fix?**  
A13: Wrap the argument or return type containing commas in extra parentheses or define type aliases. For example:

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<int, int>), GetPair, ());
```

See [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md#MOCK_METHOD) for details.

### Best Practices and Tips

- Group related tests in test suites with descriptive names reflecting the code under test for better organization.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions over `ASSERT_*` unless you need to stop a test on failure.
- Use test fixtures to reduce repetition and share configuration.
- Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()`.
- Use GoogleMock’s `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` appropriately to balance test strictness and flexibility.
- Start with simple tests and progressively explore parameterized tests and mocks.

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Failures and Linking Errors">
Check that:
- Your compiler supports C++17.
- You link against both `gtest` and `gtest_main` (or `gmock` and `gmock_main` if mocking).
- CMakeLists.txt includes proper dependencies.
- On Windows, ensure `gtest_force_shared_crt` is set to avoid runtime library mismatches.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Test Failures or No Tests Run">
- Confirm test cases are defined properly using `TEST` or `TEST_F`.
- Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called once and its result returned.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` command line argument to list discovered tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="GoogleMock Warnings about Uninteresting Calls">
- Either suppress warnings with `NiceMock` or set explicit expectations with `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.
- Review if missing `EXPECT_CALL`s might indicate incomplete tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Issues with Complex Signatures">
- Use parentheses or typedefs to wrap types with commas in `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Verify overridden methods have matching qualifiers and signatures.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Writing Your First Tests: A Quick Walkthrough

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Include the Headers">
Include GoogleTest headers and optionally GoogleMock:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>  // Only if using mocks
```
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Define Simple Tests">
Use the `TEST` macro to define tests:

```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, TestName) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Use Fixtures for Shared Setup">
Define a test fixture class derived from `testing::Test` and use `TEST_F`:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize shared resources
  }
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestBody) {
  // Use fixture resources
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Run Tests">
Write or link a `main()` function (or link `gtest_main`) which calls:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Build and execute your test binary.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use meaningful test suite and test names to clarify intent.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*` to let a test report multiple failures.
- Group shared setup into fixtures for test clarity and reuse.
- Start with simple, isolated tests; add mocks and parameterization as needed.
- Always check the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your test entry point.
- Use GoogleMock's `ON_CALL` for defaults and `EXPECT_CALL` for verification.
