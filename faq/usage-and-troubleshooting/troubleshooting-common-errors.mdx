# Troubleshooting Common Errors

This page helps you quickly identify and resolve frequent issues encountered while using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including test discovery failures, assertion mismatches, and problems with linking mock classes. By focusing on clear diagnostic steps and actionable solutions, this guide ensures you get unstuck fast and keep your tests running smoothly.

---

## Common Error Patterns

### 1. Test Discovery Issues

Your tests may fail to appear or run if GoogleTest cannot discover them properly. Common causes and fixes include:

- **Missing test registration:** Ensure you use the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros properly. Tests must be linked into the executable and compiled with GoogleTest.
- **Improper main() setup:** Confirm you call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` function.
- **Build integration errors:** Verify your build system properly links against GoogleTest libraries and that source files containing tests are included.

**Quick Diagnostic:** Run your tests with verbose logging:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

If tests don’t list, verify compilation and linking of test code.

---

### 2. Assertion Failures

Tests fail when actual outcomes differ from expected results. This can happen due to incorrect test code or bugs in the code under test.

**Tips to diagnose and fix assertion failures:**

- Use descriptive failure messages with `<<` streaming to add context.
- Run tests with increased verbosity to see detailed matcher and argument outputs:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
  ```

- Check for floating-point precision issues and use assertions like `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR` for approximate comparisons.
- When using custom matchers or predicates, ensure correctness by adding detailed diagnostics.

**Example:**

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Mismatch at case 5";
```

### 3. Linking Problems with Mocks

Common linking errors arise when mock method implementations are missing or improperly declared.

**Causes and Solutions:**

- **Forgot to include `#include <gmock/gmock.h>`:** Your mock classes depend on this header for method implementations.
- **Defined `MOCK_METHOD` inappropriately:** Must be declared in the `public:` section of your mock class.
- **Missing virtual destructor in base interface:** Always ensure interfaces have a virtual destructor to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Old style mock macros usage:** Prefer the modern `MOCK_METHOD` macro over legacy macros for better compatibility.

**Best Practice:** Place mock class declarations in header files included by test sources, and define constructors and destructors in source files if compilation speed is a concern.

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

Follow these steps to quickly understand and resolve frequent issues:

1. **Verify test registration:** Run your binary with `--gtest_list_tests` to see discovered tests.
2. **Enable detailed mock diagnostics:** Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls, matched expectations, and failures.
3. **Check your expectations:** Ensure all expected calls are set with `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising the code.
4. **Confirm mock object lifecycle:** Make sure mock objects get destructed properly so expectations are verified.
5. **Review matchers and argument types:** Mismatched argument types or overload ambiguity may lead to unexpected failures.

## Guided Solutions to Common Scenarios

### Scenario: "Uninteresting function call encountered" Warning

This warning indicates a mock method was called without a matching `EXPECT_CALL`. It is informational, not an error, but may point to missing test expectations.

**How to handle:**
- Add `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` if calls are expected but don’t need strict checks.
- If you wish to suppress all such warnings, wrap your mock with `NiceMock`, e.g.: 

```cpp
NiceMock<MockClass> nice_mock;
```

**Avoid** adding empty `EXPECT_CALL`s blindly to silence this warning; instead, understand why the call happens.

---

### Scenario: Excessive or Unexpected Calls

When a mock method is called more times than expected or with unexpected arguments, GoogleMock reports an error.

**Fixes:**
- Increase or adjust the `Times()` clause.
- Use wildcard matcher `_` in `EXPECT_CALL` to relax argument constraints.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after they are satisfied to permit other calls.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(42));
```

---

### Scenario: Mock Methods Calling Real Implementations Unexpectedly

Occurs if a method being mocked is not virtual, or if expectations are set after method calls.

**Check:**
- All methods to be mocked **must** be virtual.
- Set all `EXPECT_CALL`s **before** any calls to the mock.

---

## Best Practices to Prevent Common Pitfalls

- Always mock virtual methods and put `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public` section.
- Set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) before calling methods on mocks.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers consciously according to test needs.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` for non-sticky expectations if needed.
- Use sequences or `InSequence` when call order matters.
- Confirm custom matchers and actions produce reliable diagnostics.

## Troubleshooting Example: Investigating Assertion Failures

When a test fails to meet an assertion, follow this simple checklist:

1. Run test with verbosity:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

2. Review which expectation matched the failing call.
3. Check argument values showed in the failure message.
4. Narrow down the failure cause by adding focused expectations or matchers.
5. Verify changes fix the failure without breaking other tests.

---

## Additional Tips

- **Heap check failures** often indicate missing virtual destructors in interfaces.
- **Overloaded methods** require explicit matcher disambiguation using wrappers like `Const()`.
- Use `ON_CALL` for setting default behavior **without** expectation.
- Use GoogleTest's `EXPECT_THAT` and custom matchers for flexible assertions.
