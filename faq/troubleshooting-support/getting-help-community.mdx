- When posting questions on forums or issue trackers, **use clear titles and provide reproducible examples**.
- To dig deeper on mocking specifics, start with **gMock for Dummies** and the **Mocking Reference**.
- Utilize verbosity flags like `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain insights during test failures.

## Troubleshooting Section

If you encounter issues that are not resolved by the documentation or community resources:

<Accordion title="Common Support Issues and How to Address Them">
**Installation and Build Issues:** Ensure your environment meets the prerequisites listed in the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../getting-started/setup-introduction/prerequisites-requirements) page. Verify that C++17 is enabled and the correct compiler flags are set.

**Runtime Errors:** Use the `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to obtain detailed logs of mock expectations and calls. Confirm the mock methods are set up correctly before invocation.

**Test Failures Due to Expectations:** Review the ordering and cardinalities of `EXPECT_CALL` statements. Use sequences or `RetiresOnSaturation()` for ordered or repetitive calls.

**Community Resources Not Responsive:** Consider posting detailed issues on the GitHub issues tracker or checking recent commits for potential fixes.
</Accordion>
