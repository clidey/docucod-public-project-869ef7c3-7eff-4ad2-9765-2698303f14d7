# Test Performance and Optimization FAQ

GoogleTest empowers users managing extensive or time-sensitive test environments with strategies and practical tips to speed up test execution, handle large test suites efficiently, and address common bottlenecks in the testing workflow. This FAQ guides you through optimizing your testing setup and troubleshooting common performance issues.

## 1. Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I speed up the execution of large test suites?

GoogleTest provides several techniques to accelerate tests, including leveraging shared setup in test fixtures, running tests in parallel, and using test sharding for distributed execution. Shared fixtures reduce redundant initialization, while sharding splits tests across machines or processes to run concurrently. Use appropriate filters to run only relevant tests, minimizing unnecessary test execution.

### What are the best practices for sharing expensive resources across tests?

Define `static` members in your test fixture classes to hold shared resources and use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` (formerly `SetUpTestCase`/`TearDownTestCase`) for per-suite setup and teardown. GoogleTest will initialize and destroy these shared resources only once per test suite, drastically cutting repeated setup costs for expensive resources.

Example:
```cpp
class MyTestSuite : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* MyTestSuite::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

### How do I run tests in parallel to reduce overall runtime?

GoogleTest supports parallel execution via *sharding*, where the test suite is split across multiple shards (processes or machines). Control this with environment variables:

- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: total number of shards
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: the zero-based index of the current shard

Using these settings, each shard runs only a subset of tests, making total runtime nearly inversely proportional to the number of shards.

Ensure your tests are independent and don't have shared mutable state to avoid flaky results during parallel runs.

### What command-line flags or environment variables help control test execution for performance?

Key options include:

- `--gtest_filter`: Run only a subset of tests matching a pattern.
- `--gtest_repeat=N`: Run tests multiple times to detect flaky tests or gain profiling data.
- `--gtest_shuffle`: Randomize test execution order to uncover inter-test dependencies.
- `--gtest_fail_fast`: Stops execution on first failure, speeding up fix cycles during debugging.

These flags can be combined to optimize test runs without changing test code.

### How can I avoid test execution bottlenecks caused by setup/teardown?

Reduce setup and teardown cost by moving expensive initialization to `SetUpTestSuite()` and expensive cleanup to `TearDownTestSuite()`. Avoid placing costly operations in `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` if they can be shared safely.

For global initialization/cleanup across all tests, use global test environments derived from `::testing::Environment` with overridden `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods registered via `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()`.

### How do parameterized and typed tests help improve test performance?

Parameterized (`TEST_P`) and typed tests (`TYPED_TEST`) allow a single test definition to run over different inputs or types without duplication of code. They promote reuse and organization, reduce code size, and make it easier to selectively instantiate and run subsets of tests, improving both maintainability and speed when configured correctly.

### What are common pitfalls that can degrade test performance?

- Running the full test suite unnecessarily instead of filtering to a relevant subset.
- Excessive or heavyweight resource setup in per-test setup functions instead of per-suite or global setup.
- Writing dependent tests which rely on shared mutable state, leading to flaky tests and difficult parallelization.
- Running too many parameterized test cases without a strategy to limit or shard execution.

### Is GoogleTest thread-safe for parallel test execution?

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms supporting pthreads. However, GoogleTest runs each test sequentially in a single thread by default. Parallel execution is better achieved at the process level using sharding or external parallel test runners like `gtest-parallel`.

### How can I monitor and profile test performance to find bottlenecks?

Enable XML or JSON output (`--gtest_output=xml:<file>` or `json:<file>`) for detailed test durations. Analyze reported times to identify slow tests or suites. Combine with `--gtest_repeat` or external profiling tools to gather more data.

Use event listeners (see Sample #9) to hook into test lifecycle events and emit custom performance logs or integrate with your CI system.

### How to suppress verbose output to focus on performance?

Use the `--gtest_brief=1` flag or set the `GTEST_BRIEF` environment variable to display only failures, reducing console clutter. This helps speed up test runs when running large suites with many successful tests.

### What should I do if tests hang or timeout frequently?

Investigate shared state and resource dependencies that lead to deadlocks. Enable `--gtest_shuffle` to detect inter-test order issues. If running with sharding or parallel runners, ensure tests are isolated and independent.

Use the `--gtest_break_on_failure` flag to halt at the point of first failure or hang for debugging.

### Where can I safely change GoogleTest flags programmatically?

You can set flags via:
```cpp
GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
```

Do this before calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` to control test execution behaviors such as death test styles, fail-fast mode, or exception catching.

### How do I write efficient tests that scale well?

- Use value-parameterized and typed tests to reduce code duplication.
- Share resources using `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`.
- Run tests in shards or parallel processes.
- Use filtering to run small subsets while developing.
- Avoid global mutable state and expensive initializations in `SetUp()`.

### Can I customize test output to debug performance issues?

Yes. Using custom event listeners allows you to modify or supplement output. Sample #9 shows an example listener that replaces the default console output with minimal output focusing on test start/end and results, helping to reduce noise and highlight timing and failure data.

## 2. Common Issues & Gotchas

### Installation & Build
- Ensure your compiler supports C++17, a requirement since GoogleTest 1.17.0.
- Use CMake 3.14 or higher to take advantage of `FetchContent` for embedding GoogleTest.

### Configuration
- Visual Studio users may face linker runtime mismatches; set `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to handle this.
- Avoid mixing shared and static runtimes in GoogleTest and your tests.

### Performance Pitfalls
- Avoid excessive per-test `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` when resources can be shared.
- Disabled tests (prefixed with `DISABLED_`) still compile and affect suite size; track and remove them promptly.
- Test sharding variables (`GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`) must be consistent across environment to avoid skipped or duplicated tests.

### Parallel Execution
- Not all tests are safe for parallel execution; verify thread safety and resource isolation.
- Death tests need special handling due to process forking and thread safety considerations.

## 3. Troubleshooting Procedures

### Unable to speed up test execution?
1. Verify your test filtering settings to limit test runs.
2. Use `SetUpTestSuite()` for shared resource initialization.
3. Enable test sharding if you have multiple machines or cores.
4. Profile test durations with XML/JSON output.

### Test output is too verbose?
- Remove the default result printer with:
```cpp
  auto& listeners = testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
  delete listeners.Release(listeners.default_result_printer());
```
- Add a minimal custom output listener or use the `--gtest_brief` flag.

### Tests fail or hang under parallel or repeated runs?
- Confirm your tests do not share mutable global or static state without synchronization.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to change test order and detect inter-test dependencies.
- Add `GTEST_SKIP()` for tests that depend on unavailable resources.

### Fatal assertions are not stopping subroutine execution?
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` macros to ensure failures propagate in subroutines.
- Consider using a custom test event listener that throws exceptions on fatal failures to halt test execution promptly.
