# Which platforms and compilers are supported?

This page clarifies the supported operating systems, compilers, and architectures for GoogleTest and GoogleMock according to Google's foundational C++ policy. It provides guidance on best practices to maintain compatibility and points to authoritative resources for detailed compatibility information.

---

## Supported Operating Systems and Architectures

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support a wide range of operating systems and architectures following Google's foundational C++ support policy. The most stable and actively maintained platforms include:

- **Linux**, including common distributions
- **macOS** (Mac OS X and iOS variants)
- **Windows**, including Desktop, MinGW, and Mobile versions

Additional platforms with varying degrees of support include:

- BSD variants such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and DragonFlyBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
- Fuchsia
- Google Native Client (NaCl)
- z/OS
- Embedded and specialized platforms (e.g., ESP32, Xtensa)

Support for some platforms like Cygwin and less common operating systems can be less stable due to limited maintenance resources.

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a **C++17-compliant** compiler as a minimum. Supported compiler families include:

- **GCC** (versions supporting C++17 and above)
- **Clang** (versions supporting C++17 and above)
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**: Version 19.11 (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3) or later
- **Intel C++ Compiler** (where applicable)
- Other compilers with compliant C++17 support and compatibility with Google's portability macros

Special notes:

- The minimum C++ standard supported is **C++17**; earlier standards are not supported.
- Certain compiler and platform combinations may require explicit flags or macro definitions to handle platform-specific features.

## Key Platform and Feature Detection Macros

GoogleTest automatically detects platform and compiler features at compile time using a series of macros. These macros enable conditional compilation within the framework to maintain consistent behavior across diverse environments.

Examples include:

- `GTEST_OS_...` macros to identify the operating system, such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, etc.
- Feature flags like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` for POSIX thread support, `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` to check exception availability, and `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` for run-time type information support.
- Support for stream redirection (`GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`) and death tests (`GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`) depends on platform capabilities.

These macros are predefined and users should not redefine them.

## Maintaining Compatibility: Best Practices

To ensure your use of GoogleTest remains compatible across platforms and compilers:

1. **Target C++17 or higher**: Verify your build environment uses a C++17-compliant compiler.

2. **Use official build configurations**: Leverage GoogleTest's Bazel or CMake configurations, which handle platform-specific flags and definitions automatically.

3. **Avoid relying on undefined behavior or platform-specific hacks.** GoogleTest abstracts many platform differences; use its APIs and macros instead of duplicating platform checks.

4. **Consult the compatibility matrix regularly**: Google maintains an official compatibility matrix detailing tested platforms and compiler versions.

5. **Test on multiple platforms early**: Incorporate continuous integration that builds and runs tests on all target platforms.


## Authoritative Compatibility Matrix and Resources

The definitive source for supported platforms and compiler versions is Google's foundational C++ support policy and the associated compatibility matrix:

- [Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
- [Supported Platforms and Compiler Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

These resources list supported OS versions, compiler versions, and required build tools such as CMake and Bazel.

For detailed platform-specific guidance and troubleshooting, refer to:

- [Getting Started: Prerequisites & System Requirements](/getting-started/setup-basics/prerequisites-system-requirements)
- [Getting Started: Installation Instructions](/getting-started/setup-basics/installation-instructions)
- [Guides on Integration & Platform Support](/guides/real-world-testing/integration-support)

### Example: Build Configuration in Bazel

GoogleTest's Bazel configuration (`BUILD.bazel`) uses conditional platform settings to select appropriate compiler flags, linker options, and dependencies based on the detected platform. For example:

```python
config_setting(
    name = "windows",
    constraint_values = ["@platforms//os:windows"],
)

cc_library(
    name = "gtest",
    copts = select({
        ":windows": [],
        "//conditions:default": ["-pthread"],
    }),
    linkopts = select({
        ":windows": [],
        "//conditions:default": ["-pthread"],
    }),
    deps = select({
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
    ...
)
```

This approach ensures appropriate compiler and linker flags on each supported platform.


## Troubleshooting Platform and Compiler Issues

- **Compiler version too old:** If you encounter compilation errors related to unsupported C++ features, verify that your compiler version supports C++17 or upgrade it.

- **Missing threading or platform libraries:** On some Unix-like systems, you need to link against `pthread` or other threading libraries.

- **Windows-specific quirks:** Pay attention to runtime library settings and calling conventions on MSVC. Use the supplied `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries to bootstrap your tests.

- **Unsupported platforms:** GoogleTest may build but not fully support some platforms; if you encounter issues, check for the latest updates or consider contributing fixes.


## Summary

This page guides you through understanding which platforms and compilers are officially supported by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It is essential to align your development environment with Google’s foundational C++ support policy to ensure seamless experience with the framework across diverse environments.
