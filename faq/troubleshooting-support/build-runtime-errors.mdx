# Resolving Build and Runtime Errors

This page addresses common error messages related specifically to GoogleTest project setup, linking issues, missing dependencies, and runtime test failures. It provides clear, actionable diagnostics and targeted next steps to quickly unblock developers facing build or test execution problems.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why am I getting linker errors when integrating GoogleTest?
Linker errors often occur due to missing GoogleTest libraries or incorrect build configurations.

- **Problem**: Undefined references to GoogleTest symbols during linking.
- **Cause**: The GoogleTest library is not linked correctly to your test target.
- **Solution**:
  1. Confirm that your build system links the GoogleTest static or shared library (`gtest` and optionally `gtest_main`).
  2. If using CMake, use `target_link_libraries(your_test_target gtest gtest_main)`.
  3. Ensure include directories are set so headers like `<gtest/gtest.h>` are found.
  4. Verify that GoogleTest has been built before running your test build.

### What causes 'missing dependencies' errors during build?

- GoogleTest depends on standard libraries and must be built with compatible compilers.
- Ensure your environment targets C++17 or later as required.
- Confirm that all required source files and headers are included.
- For external builds, check path references and environmental variables.

### My tests compile, but fail at runtime with mysterious errors. What should I do?

- Review runtime error messages carefully; GoogleTest prints file locations and messages.
- Enable detailed logging or increase stack trace depth with `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=N`.
- Confirm that test dependencies or fixtures are correctly initialized.
- Check for mixing of incompatible GoogleTest versions or conflicting libraries.
- If using death tests, ensure test suite naming ends with `DeathTest` to avoid threading and execution order issues.

### Why am I experiencing flaky test failures or unexpected skips?

- Using `DISABLED_` prefix on test names disables them; verify you haven't accidentally disabled tests.
- If tests depend on order, enable `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test order and expose bad dependencies.
- For setup issues, check that `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` execute correctly.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` appropriately to indicate intentional skipping.

### How do environment variables like `GTEST_FILTER` affect which tests run?

- `GTEST_FILTER` lets you include or exclude tests matching patterns.
- Use `--gtest_filter=PositivePatterns[-NegativePatterns]` to select tests.
- If no tests are selected, GoogleTest may warn or error based on flags like `--gtest_fail_if_no_test_selected`.

### What steps can I take if GoogleTest exits prematurely or crashes?

- GoogleTest uses a premature-exit file protocol to detect this.
- Run under a debugger or increase logging.
- Ensure that your tests or fixtures don't cause exceptions or process aborts unexpectedly.
- Test your code with minimal tests to isolate failing components.


## Common Errors & Diagnostic Steps

### Build Failures

- **Linker errors referencing gtest symbols**
  - Check linkage to GoogleTest libraries.
  - Verify compile and link flags.

- **Compiler errors due to missing `gtest/gtest.h` or internal headers**
  - Confirm include directories include GoogleTest headers.
  - Verify that your source files include the correct headers.

- **Conflicting versions or symbols**
  - Clean previous build artifacts.
  - Avoid mixing source-built GoogleTest with installed packages of different versions.

### Runtime Test Failures

- **Non-fatal failure messages from assertions**
  - Review source lines and messages emitted by GoogleTest.
  - Use `EXPECT_*` vs `ASSERT_*` appropriately.

- **Fatal failures causing test termination**
  - Inspect stack traces and file locations.
  - Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to drop into debuggers upon failure.

- **Test suites or tests skipped unexpectedly**
  - Check for `GTEST_SKIP()` usage.
  - Verify test and test suite naming, especially disabling patterns like `DISABLED_`.

### Common Pitfalls

- Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same test suite is illegal.
- Using assertions with side effects that are evaluated multiple times.
- Not calling `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` leads to undefined behavior.


## Actionable Next Steps

1. **Check your build integration**
   - Use CMake snippets from the Installation guide to properly include and link GoogleTest.
2. **Verify test filtering flags**
   - Use `--gtest_list_tests` to display tests and ensure filtering is correct.
3. **Enable detailed output**
   - Set `--gtest_stack_trace_depth` to a higher number for better diagnostics.
4. **Use event listeners for advanced diagnostics**
   - Customize test output to capture failures or skipped tests precisely.
5. **Consult related troubleshooting guides**
   - See [Troubleshooting & Common Issues](../getting-started/first-steps-validation/troubleshooting.md) for broader coverage.


## Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Did you run `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`?
- [ ] Is GoogleTest properly built and linked into your test target?
- [ ] Are the include paths correctly configured?
- [ ] Are the test names and test suites properly defined without conflicting fixture usage?
- [ ] Are environment variables and command line flags set with intended values?
- [ ] Did you confirm the correctness of death tests and special test styles?
- [ ] Is your build system compatible with C++17 standard or higher?


## Useful GoogleTest Flags for Diagnosing Issues

| Flag                                         | Description                                  |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_list_tests`                          | List all test names without running them.    |
| `--gtest_filter=<pattern>`                    | Run tests matching the pattern.               |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`                    | Debugger break on first failure.              |
| `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=<N>`               | Number of stack frames printed on failure.   |
| `--gtest_shuffle`                             | Randomize test order to detect dependencies. |
| `--gtest_repeat=<N>`                          | Repeat tests N times to catch flaky failures.|
| `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`            | Include disabled tests in execution.          |
| `--gtest_fail_fast`                           | Stop test execution at first failure.         |
| `--gtest_throw_on_failure`                    | Throw exceptions on failure (for integration).|


## Troubleshooting Runtime Failures

To diagnose runtime test failures:

<Steps>
<Step title="Run tests with detailed output">
Execute your test binary with `--gtest_print_time=1` and increase `--gtest_stack_trace_depth` for more info.
</Step>
<Step title="Identify failing test case">
The console output will highlight failed tests with file and line details.
</Step>
<Step title="Use SCOPED_TRACE to add context">
If sub-function failures are unclear, add `SCOPED_TRACE` in helper functions to clarify.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify fixture setup and teardown">
Ensure your `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, `SetUpTestSuite()`, and `TearDownTestSuite()` do not fail or skip in unexpected ways.
</Step>
<Step title="Avoid mixing TEST and TEST_F">
Check that tests within a suite consistently use either `TEST` or `TEST_F` fixtures.
</Step>
</Steps>
