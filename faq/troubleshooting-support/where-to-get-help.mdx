## Official Project Documentation

The official documents provide extensive guidance and reference material maintained by the GoogleTest team. These include:

- **GoogleTest User's Guide:** Groundbreaking foundation covering installation, usage, and core concepts.
- **gMock Cookbook:** Comprehensive recipes and advanced mocking techniques.
- **Legacy gMock FAQ:** Answers to frequently encountered questions and troubleshooting tips.
- **gMock Cheat Sheet:** Quick reference cards for mocking syntax, matchers, and actions.

## GitHub Resources

All GoogleTest and GoogleMock source code, along with issue tracking and project discussions, are hosted on GitHub:

- **Repository:** https://github.com/google/googletest
- **Issue Tracker:** https://github.com/google/googletest/issues

### How to Report Issues

Open well-defined issues with a clear title and detailed reproducible steps. Include:

- A minimal code example demonstrating the problem
- Your environment details (OS, compiler, version)
- Error messages or logs

### Feature Requests

Before requesting features, check existing issues to avoid duplicates. Provide a rationale and possible design ideas for your proposal.

## Community Documentation

Community members have created valuable content that supplements official documentation. Some examples include:

- [Googlemock Insights](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md) by ElectricRCAircraftGuy — a fresh perspective with tips and best practices.

This external documentation can provide practical examples and alternative viewpoints.

## Asking Questions and Getting Help

For help beyond documentation and bug reports:

- **Stack Overflow:** Tag questions with `googletest` and/or `googlemock` to tap into the extensive developer community.
- **Google Testing Forum:** Official Google group for discussions and announcements.
- **GitHub Discussions:** Sometimes enabled on the gtest repo for community support (check availability).

When asking questions, provide code snippets and environment details to get precise answers.
