# Where to Get Help and Find Community Resources

This page directs you to the active support channels, community resources, and contribution guidelines, ensuring you know how to seek help, ask questions, and engage with the GoogleTest and GoogleMock communities effectively.

## Official Support Channels

### GoogleTest GitHub Repository

The primary resource for reporting issues, requesting features, and contributing to the project is the GitHub repository:

- Repository URL: [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

You can **file issues** related to bugs or enhancement requests, and participate in discussions through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

### Mailing Lists and Forums

Official mailing lists or forums provide targeted support from project maintainers and other experienced users.
While GoogleTest does not maintain a dedicated mailing list, you can often find discussions related to testing, GoogleTest, and GoogleMock on broader C++ or developer forums such as:

- Stack Overflow: Tag your questions with [`googletest`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/googletest) or [`gmock`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gmock).
- Google Groups: Search for testing-related groups that include GoogleTest community.

When posting questions, provide **clear context, error messages, code snippets, and environment details** to get the best assistance.

### Issue Tracker Best Practices

When filing issues on GitHub or other channels:
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Use descriptive titles.
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce.
- Include relevant logs, error outputs, and minimal reproducible examples.

This approach helps maintainers and community members respond quickly and effectively.

## Community Resources

### Community-Contributed Documentation

Apart from official docs, valuable resources produced by the community can enhance your learning and troubleshooting:

- [Googlemock Insights](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md) by ElectricRCAircraftGuy provides in-depth explanations and practical tips.

### Tutorials and Guides

Many users and organizations publish tutorials, blogs, and example projects demonstrating best practices with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Searching with keywords like “GoogleTest tutorial” or “GoogleMock examples” can reveal helpful content.

### Q&A and Knowledge Sharing

- Stack Overflow tags `googletest` and `gmock`
- Reddit’s r/cpp or other programming communities

Engaging in these channels allows you to learn from real-world problems and solutions shared by other users.
