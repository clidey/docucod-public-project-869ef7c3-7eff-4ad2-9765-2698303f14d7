# FAQ: Tips for Using GoogleTest/GoogleMock in Large Projects

Welcome to the guide designed to empower you with proven strategies for scaling GoogleTest and GoogleMock to accommodate thousands of tests and integrate smoothly with large codebases and CI pipelines. This FAQ focuses exclusively on practical advice to manage test reliability, reduce flakiness, maintain organization, and optimize execution in complex projects.

---

## 1. How can I efficiently organize thousands of tests in a large project?

Managing a huge number of tests requires a systematic organization:

- **Group tests by logical components or features** using test suites and fixtures. This makes discovery and maintenance intuitive.
- Use **parameterized and typed tests** to reduce duplication while expanding coverage.
- Utilize naming conventions that reflect project modules and features consistently.
- Split very large test files into smaller ones by feature or concern.

**Example:** For a large graphics library, organize tests under suites like `RendererTests`, `ShaderTests`, and use parameterized tests for supported hardware variations.

## 2. What strategies reduce flakiness and increase test reliability at scale?

At scale, flaky tests can obscure genuine failures. To maintain reliability:

- **Isolate tests fully** by avoiding shared mutable state. GoogleTest creates fresh fixture instances per test to help.
- Use **mocking (GoogleMock)** to replace non-deterministic components like network or filesystem.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions for non-fatal failures, but use `ASSERT_*` to stop on critical failures.
- Regularly **review and fix flaky tests rather than ignore or disable them**.
- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE()`** to add context to failures, assisting in debugging flakes.

---

## 3. How can I integrate GoogleTest/GoogleMock smoothly with Continuous Integration (CI) environments?

Large projects need automated, repeatable builds and tests. For CI integration:

- Use supported build systems with built-in GoogleTest support, such as **CMake** or **Bazel**.
- Set up **test discovery and execution via command line** with filtering to run subsets or shards.
- Leverage **test result output as XML** (`--gtest_output=xml`) for CI to parse and report results.
- Configure **parallel test execution** using `--gtest_parallel` or CI platform native concurrency for speed.
- Use **`Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`** in tests that create mocks on heap to verify expectations explicitly in long-running tests or complex environments.

See detailed instructions in: [Integration with Build and CI systems](/guides/beyond-basics/integration-build-systems)

---

## 4. What are best practices for reducing test runtime without sacrificing coverage?

To keep your test suite fast:

- Use **test sharding and parallelization** to distribute tests across multiple agents.
- Prefer **fast, isolated unit tests** by mocking dependencies.
- Use **shared test fixtures setup/teardown** with `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to prepare expensive common resources once per test suite.
- Avoid redundant work by sharing stateless data.
- Regularly **profile tests to identify slow cases** and optimize or isolate them.

## 5. How do I manage uninteresting calls and control mock strictness in large test suites?

Handling uninteresting mock calls gracefully is critical:

- Use `NiceMock<T>` to **suppress warnings** for uninteresting calls when you don’t want to verify every call.
- Use `NaggyMock<T>` (default) to **warn on uninteresting calls**.
- Use `StrictMock<T>` to **fail on unexpected or uninteresting calls**, enforcing strict verification.

Choosing the right strictness helps balance noise versus strict verification.

See detailed guidance: [Mock Strictness: Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks](/guides/mocking-masterclass/mock-class-strictness)

---

## 6. How do I handle test discovery and selective execution in large projects?

GoogleTest supports:

- **Test filtering** via `--gtest_filter=` to run subsets of tests matching name patterns.
- **Test sharding** to split tests across multiple runners.
- **Running parameterized and typed tests** with explicit instantiation and filtering.

Combine these with build system capabilities for flexible selective test execution in CI.

See: [Test Discovery and Build Integration](/guides/getting-started/test-discovery-setup)

---

## 7. How can I diagnose and fix flaky or failing tests in large suites?

- Run failing tests in isolation with `--gtest_filter=SuiteName.TestName` to reproduce failures.
- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to rerun flaky tests multiple times and verify consistency.
- Enable detailed output with `--gmock_verbose=info` to track mock call matches and exceptions.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add valuable trace info around flaky failure points.
- Inspect test output logs and XML reports for clues about failures.
- Refactor tests to be more deterministic and mock unpredictable dependencies.

## 8. What are recommended approaches for mocking in big projects?

- Avoid mocking classes you do not own; instead, create wrappers or interfaces under your control.
- Define mocks in a dedicated testing directory or package for reusability across teams.
- Use **delegation to fakes or real objects** via `ON_CALL` and lambdas to keep mocks realistic.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to check explicitly intended interactions; prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors.
- Utilize advanced mock features like sequences, cardinalities, and actions to model complex behavior.

## 9. How does GoogleMock handle concurrency in large, threaded tests?

- GoogleMock is thread-safe and supports concurrent calls to different mock objects or the same mock methods.
- Follow these rules:
  - Perform test setup and destruction in a single thread to avoid race conditions.
  - Mock method calls can safely run concurrently in multiple threads.
  - Use thread-safe synchronization inside actions if order matters across threads.
  - Avoid setting or clearing expectations concurrently.

For detailed concurrency behavior and examples, see the stress test in [gmock_stress_test.cc](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/test/gmock_stress_test.cc).
