# Getting Started: Your First Test

Welcome to this quick-start tutorial aimed at helping you write and run your first unit test using the GoogleTest framework in a C++ project. This guide focuses solely on the essential steps to get your initial test up and running smoothly.

---

## 1. Overview

### What This Guide Covers

This page walks you step-by-step through:

- Setting up GoogleTest in your project environment
- Writing a basic test case
- Understanding simple assertion usage
- Building and running your test binary

If you are new to C++ unit testing or the GoogleTest framework, this practical introductory tutorial will empower you to quickly grasp the core workflow.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

- You have a working C++ build environment (compiler, build system)
- GoogleTest is properly installed or integrated in your project (see [Installing with CMake](../set-up-prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake.md) or [Installing with Bazel](../set-up-prerequisites-installation/installation-bazel.md))
- Basic familiarity with compiling and running C++ programs

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:

- Have a test file with a simple test case using GoogleTest syntax
- Know how to assert expected values
- Successfully compile and run your test binary
- Understand how to interpret the test results output

### Estimated Time

Approximately 15-30 minutes depending on your environment and familiarity with C++.

## 2. Writing and Running Your First Test

Follow these essential steps in sequence.

### Step 1: Include GoogleTest Header

Start by including the GoogleTest header in your test source file.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

This brings in all necessary definitions for writing tests.

### Step 2: Define a Test Case

Write a simple test case using the TEST macro. The macro takes two parameters: the test suite name and the test name.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(ExampleTestSuite, SimpleAddition) {
    int sum = 2 + 2;
    EXPECT_EQ(sum, 4);  // Assert that sum equals 4
}
```

This test verifies that the expression `2 + 2` equals 4.

### Step 3: Build Your Test File

Compile your test source file with your C++ compiler, linking against the GoogleTest libraries.

**Example using g++ and CMake:**

```bash
# If using CMake, add a target for your test:
add_executable(my_first_test first_test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_first_test gtest_main)
```

**Or compile manually:**

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include \
    -pthread first_test.cpp /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a -o my_first_test
```

Replace `/path/to/` with your actual paths.

### Step 4: Run Your Test Binary

Execute your test binary.

```bash
./my_first_test
```

Expected output shows the test running and its success status. Example:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from ExampleTestSuite
[ RUN      ] ExampleTestSuite.SimpleAddition
[       OK ] ExampleTestSuite.SimpleAddition (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from ExampleTestSuite ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

You have successfully written and run your first GoogleTest test!

## 3. Understanding Basic Test Structure

GoogleTest tests are organized into test suites (groups) and individual tests.

- **Test Suite:** Groups related tests; named by the first parameter to `TEST()`.
- **Test Name:** The second parameter identifies the specific test case.

Within a test, you use assertion macros like `EXPECT_EQ` to compare actual values to expected values.

### Common Assertions

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`: Verifies `val1 == val2`
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`: Verifies `val1 != val2`
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`: Verifies `condition` is true
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)`: Verifies `condition` is false

Failures are reported immediately but allow the test body to continue;
Use `ASSERT_` variants to abort at failure.

---

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Keep tests focused:** Each test should verify a single logical behavior.
- **Choose descriptive names:** Name your test suites and tests to convey intent.
- **Use EXPECT over ASSERT by default:** Allows checking multiple expectations within one test.
- **Run tests frequently:** After writing small changes, to catch issues early.
- **Use debugging output if necessary:** Add logging statements within tests to trace issues.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Your First Test">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or No Output">Ensure you linked with `gtest_main` which provides the main function. Without it, your test binary may compile but not execute tests.</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors about GoogleTest Headers or Libraries">Verify include and library paths for GoogleTest are correct. Consult installation guides for CMake or Bazel setup details.</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Expected Values Not Matching Actual">Double-check your assertion logic and the values produced. Use GoogleTest output to identify which assertion failed.</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors about Undefined References to GoogleTest">Confirm you linked all required GoogleTest libraries. Static and shared linking approaches differ between platforms.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
