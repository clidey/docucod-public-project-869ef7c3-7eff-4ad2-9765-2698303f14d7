# Assertions and Test Validation

## Overview

This guide offers a comprehensive exploration of GoogleTest's assertions, empowering you to verify test outcomes precisely and maintainably. You'll learn when and how to use different assertion types—including equality, exception, and floating-point assertions—how to write custom assertions tailored to your scenarios, and follow best practices that keep your tests clear and robust.

## Why Assertions Matter

Assertions are the cornerstone of unit testing in GoogleTest, enabling you to express expected conditions and validate that the code behaves as intended. Effective use of assertions allows you to:

- Detect defects early with meaningful failures
- Capture precise intent in tests for maintainability
- Differentiate between critical failures and recoverable conditions

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest test writing
- GoogleTest properly installed and configured within your C++ project
- Basic understanding of C++ assertions and testing philosophy


---

## Types of Assertions in GoogleTest

GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions, each optimized for different validation scenarios:

### 1. Equality Assertions

Use equality assertions to check whether two values or objects are equivalent.

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Non-fatal assertion; test continues after failure.
- `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Fatal assertion; test aborts at failure.
- Variants: `EXPECT_NE`, `ASSERT_NE` for inequality.


**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, SquareRoot) {
  double result = sqrt(36);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 6);
}
```

### 2. Boolean Assertions

Check explicitly for true or false conditions.

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr);
ASSERT_FALSE(flag);
```

### 3. String Assertions

Specialized for C-style strings and C++ string-like types.

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` — compares C-style strings for equality.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` — compares C-style strings for inequality.
- `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)` / `EXPECT_STRCASENE` for case-insensitive comparisons.


### 4. Floating-Point Assertions

Deal with precision challenges in floating-point comparisons.

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Checks equality with small absolute error.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` — Same for double precision.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` — Checks that values are within a specified absolute tolerance.


**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated_value, expected_value, 1e-5);
```

### 5. Exception Assertions

Verify that your code throws (or does not throw) expected exceptions.

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)`
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)`
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)`


**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(Divide(10, 0), std::invalid_argument);
```

### 6. Assertion Macros vs Conditions

- Use `EXPECT_*` when you want the test to continue and report multiple assertion failures.
- Use `ASSERT_*` when a failed assertion would make further testing meaningless or could cause crashes.


---

## Writing Custom Assertions

GoogleTest allows you to write your own assertions when built-in ones don’t suffice, helping you capture domain-specific validation clearly and consistently.

### Basic Custom Assertion

Use the macro `ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT2` or `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2` to define custom comparators.

Example custom assertion to verify whether a point is inside a rectangle:

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsInsideRect(const char* point_expr,
                                         const char* rect_expr,
                                         const Point& point, const Rect& rect) {
  if (point.x >= rect.left && point.x <= rect.right &&
      point.y >= rect.top && point.y <= rect.bottom) {
    return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  } else {
    return ::testing::AssertionFailure()
           << "Point " << point_expr << " is not inside rectangle " << rect_expr;
  }
}

TEST(GeometryTest, PointInsideRect) {
  Point p{1, 2};
  Rect r{0, 0, 5, 5};
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(IsInsideRect, p, r);
}
```

### Using Matchers for Custom Assertions

GoogleTest matchers give you an elegant way to write expressive assertions (see [Matchers Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/matchers.html)).

More complex custom assertions can be constructed using `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, or implementing a matcher class.

See the [gMock Cookbook - Writing New Matchers Quickly](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#writing-new-matchers) section for complete instructions.

## Best Practices for Assertions

- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*`** unless test must stop immediately on failure.
- **Use specific assertions** (e.g., `EXPECT_STREQ` for string comparison) instead of general ones like `EXPECT_EQ`.
- **Be mindful of floating-point precision**, choosing appropriate tolerance with `EXPECT_NEAR`.
- **Leverage matchers** when checking container contents, ranges, or object properties.
- **Use descriptive messages** for custom assertions.
- **Avoid side effects inside assertions**; defer such logic outside.


---

## Examples of Assertions in Use

### Equality and Inequality

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(5, CalculateSum(2, 3));
EXPECT_NE(nullptr, pointer);
```

### Floating-Point Comparison

```cpp
double result = CalculatePiApproximation();
EXPECT_NEAR(result, 3.14159, 1e-4);
```

### Exception Testing

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(DoRiskyOperation(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(SafeOperation());
```

### Checking Container Elements

```cpp
using ::testing::ElementsAre;
EXPECT_THAT(vec, ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

### Custom Matcher Example

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsMultipleOf, factor, "is multiple of " + std::to_string(factor)) {
  return (arg % factor) == 0;
}

EXPECT_THAT(value, IsMultipleOf(7));
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Assertion Failures

- Review the assertion message carefully to understand which values did not match.
- Run tests with increased verbosity using `--gtest_verbose=info` to get detailed messages.

### Floating-Point Precision Issues

- Avoid `EXPECT_EQ` for floats or doubles; always prefer `EXPECT_NEAR` or `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`/`EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`.
- Adjust tolerance levels according to numerical stability.

### Exception Assertions

- Make sure the exception type specified matches exactly.
- Use `EXPECT_ANY_THROW` to catch any exception if exact type is not known.

### Custom Assertion Failures

- Verify implementation logic and ensure useful failure message is returned.
- Use `::testing::AssertionSuccess()` and `::testing::AssertionFailure()` to control the assertion outcome.

### Preventing Test Fragility

- Keep assertions narrowly focused on behavior.
- Avoid over-specifying arguments in mocks to prevent brittle tests.

## Summary & Next Steps

After mastering assertions, your next goals could include:

- Exploring **matchers** for flexible argument validation in mocks.
- Learning about **parameterized and type-parameterized tests** for scalable testing.
- Delving into **custom assertions** and **complex matchers** for your domain-specific needs.
- Reviewing **GoogleTest's assertion reference** for full API details.

## Additional Tips

- To check that a function is **never called**, use `.Times(0)` on an expectation.
- Use `ASSERT_*` variants to enforce preconditions that must hold before proceeding.
- Customize failure messages by embedding explanatory text or using custom assertions.
- When comparing string pointers, always match content via `EXPECT_STREQ` instead of pointer equality.
