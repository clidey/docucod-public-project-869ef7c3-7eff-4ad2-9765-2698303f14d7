# Core Testing Workflows

## Overview

This guide offers a practical, step-by-step pathway to writing, organizing, and running tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It emphasizes best practices for structuring tests, managing test lifecycle events, applying fixtures, and effectively interpreting test output to maintain high-quality coverage in real-world projects.

---

## 1. Building Your First Test

### Purpose
To write a basic, functional test case that validates a simple component behavior.

### Prerequisites
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed and properly linked to your project.
- C++17 compatible compiler environment.

### Steps
1. **Include GoogleTest headers:**

   ```cpp
   #include <gtest/gtest.h>
   ```

2. **Write a TEST case:** Define a test using the `TEST` macro with a test suite and test name.

   ```cpp
   TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
     EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
     EXPECT_TRUE(true);
   }
   ```

3. **Compile and run your test executable:** Build the executable and run it to validate the test.

### Expected Result
- The test should run and pass, displaying a summary confirming success.

---

## 2. Using Test Fixtures for Reusable Setup and Teardown

### Purpose
To reduce code duplication and share common setup/teardown logic across multiple tests.

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of test case syntax.

### Steps
1. **Define a test fixture class:** Derive from `::testing::Test`.

   ```cpp
   class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
    protected:
     void SetUp() override {
       // Setup code.
     }

     void TearDown() override {
       // Cleanup code.
     }

     // Members accessible to all tests.
     int shared_value_ = 0;
   };
   ```

2. **Write tests using the fixture:** Use `TEST_F` macro referencing the fixture.

   ```cpp
   TEST_F(MyFixture, TestOne) {
     shared_value_ = 5;
     EXPECT_EQ(shared_value_, 5);
   }

   TEST_F(MyFixture, TestTwo) {
     EXPECT_EQ(shared_value_, 0);  // Fresh for each test
   }
   ```

3. **Run all tests:** Execute to confirm all tests using the fixture pass with independent state.

### Best Practices
- Keep fixture setup concise and relevant only to the tests in the suite.

---

## 3. Setting and Verifying Expectations with GoogleMock

### Purpose
To simulate and verify interactions between the tested code and its dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with mock object creation.

### Steps
1. **Define a mock class using `MOCK_METHOD` macro** matching the interface you’re mocking.

   ```cpp
   #include <gmock/gmock.h>

   class MockTurtle {
    public:
     MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), ());
     MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), ());
   };
   ```

2. **Create an instance of the mock in your test:**

   ```cpp
   MockTurtle mock_turtle;
   ```

3. **Set expectations on the mock:** Specify the calls you expect and optionally the return values or side effects.

   ```cpp
   EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
   EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, Forward(100)).WillOnce(::testing::Return());
   ```

4. **Use the mock in the subject under test:** Pass the mock and run the test logic calling the mock methods.

5. **Verify expectations:** GoogleMock will automatically verify at test teardown if expectations were met.

### Notes
- Use `.Times()` to specify expected call count. If omitted, the default is exactly once.
- Use `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` to control behaviors.
- Use sequences and `.InSequence()` or `.After()` for ordering constraints.

---

## 4. Organizing Test Suites and Cases

### Purpose
To logically group tests, improving readability, maintenance, and coverage.

### Typical User Flow
- Group related tests into suites focused on a particular class or feature.
- Use descriptive suite and test names.
- Use fixtures when multiple tests share setup and teardown.

### Best Practices
- Write each test to verify one specific behavior or scenario.
- Avoid complex or multiple assertions per test to increase diagnosability.
- Keep tests independent and stateless.

### Example
```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, HandlesNegativeNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(-2, -4), -6);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, ThrowsOnOverflow) {
  EXPECT_THROW(calc.Add(INT_MAX, 1), std::overflow_error);
}
```

---

## 5. Running Tests and Interpreting Output

### Running Tests
- Compile your test executable.
- Run it from the terminal or IDE.
- Use GoogleTest flags for filtering tests (`--gtest_filter=...`) or controlling output verbosity.

### Typical Output Sections
- Summary of tests run, passed, skipped, or failed.
- Detailed reports for failures, including file and line, expected vs actual.

### Handling Failures
- Use the line numbers and stack traces in failure reports to jump to source code.
- Review mismatch messages for expected vs actual values.
- Enable flags like `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock interactions.

### Example Output Snippet
```
[ RUN      ] CalculatorTest.AddsPositiveNumbers
[       OK ] CalculatorTest.AddsPositiveNumbers (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] CalculatorTest.ThrowsOnOverflow
/path/to/calculator_test.cc:42: Failure
Expected: calc.Add(INT_MAX, 1) throws overflow_error
  Actual: it does not throw.
[  FAILED  ] CalculatorTest.ThrowsOnOverflow (0 ms)
```

## 6. Managing Test Lifecycle with SetUp and TearDown

### Purpose
To initialize and cleanup test environments reliably.

### Use Cases
- Allocate and release resources required exclusively by tests.
- Reset shared state between tests.

### Guidelines
- Use `SetUp()` for setups required before each test runs.
- Use `TearDown()` for cleanup immediately after each test runs.
- For global setup/teardown, consider `SetUpTestCase()` and `TearDownTestCase()` in GoogleTest (deprecated) or `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` in newer versions.

### Example
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};
```

## 7. Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Set Expectations Before Exercise:** Always set up `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` before invoking the tested code.
- **Use Matchers Liberally:** Specify only necessary argument values, use wildcards `_` for others.
- **Order Calls Explicitly If Needed:** Use sequences to enforce call ordering. Default ordering is relaxed.
- **Don’t Over-Specify:** Avoid overly tight expectations that make tests brittle.
- **Use NiceMock and StrictMock Wisely:** Defaults are Naggy mocks. `NiceMock` suppress warnings, `StrictMock` treats unexpected calls as failures.
- **Verify Calls:** Assertions on calls are verified automatically at object destruction or can be forced with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Test Fails Due to Unmet Expectations">
Check that all expected method calls occur within the test. Enable verbose logging with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock interactions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Mock Method Calls Warning">
If you see "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings, consider adding `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` or use `NiceMock` to suppress noise.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Errors with MOCK_METHOD">
Ensure that mocked methods are virtual and signatures exactly match the base class. Watch out for commas in template arguments; use parentheses or type aliases.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Hangs or Deadlocks">
Avoid calling mock methods inside their own mock actions, or manage synchronization carefully when using threads.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Objects Not Verified on Destruction">
Make sure mocks go out of scope or are deleted properly; use heap checker tools or `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` explicitly.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
