# Assertions and Best Practices

## Overview

This page provides an in-depth exploration of the assertion macros available in GoogleTest. It guides you on how to write clear, expressive, and maintainable test assertions, avoid common mistakes, and apply idiomatic testing techniques. The focus is on helping you write tests that precisely communicate intent, provide actionable failure information, and maintain robustness as code evolves.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Macros

GoogleTest distinguishes between two categories of assertion macros:

- **EXPECT_**: Non-fatal assertions that report failures but allow the test to continue.
- **ASSERT_**: Fatal assertions that abort the current test function immediately on failure.

### Key Principle
Use `EXPECT_` macros when you want tests to continue to detect multiple failures in one run. Use `ASSERT_` macros only if proceeding after failure is unsafe or meaningless.

#### Example: EXPECT_EQ and ASSERT_EQ

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(expected_value, actual_value) << "Value mismatch at index " << i;
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer must not be null before dereferencing.";
```

These assertions compare values and print detailed messages upon failures.

---

## 2. Writing Clear and Expressive Assertions

### Use Assertions That Communicate Intent
Prefer specialized assertions (`EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`) over generic ones like `EXPECT_TRUE` to get clearer error messages.

### Include Custom Failure Messages
Stream additional context with `<<` to clarify failure causes.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(x, y) << "Expected equal values but got mismatch. Index: " << index;
```

### Prefer `EXPECT_THAT` with Matchers for Complex Conditions
Use matchers to improve readability and diagnostics:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(actual_str, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, ElementsAre(1, _, 3));
```

### Utilize Predicate Assertions for Detailed Checks
If standard macros donâ€™t suffice, define a predicate function returning `AssertionResult` to generate informative failure messages.

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsValid(const MyType& obj) {
  if (obj.IsGood()) {
    return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  } else {
    return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << "Object invalid.";
  }
}
EXPECT_PRED1(IsValid, my_obj);
```

---

## 3. Common Assertion Types and Recommendations

### Boolean Conditions
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` and `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` verify simple truth values.

### Equality and Comparison
- Use:
  - `EXPECT_EQ` / `ASSERT_EQ`
  - `EXPECT_NE` / `ASSERT_NE`
  - `EXPECT_LT` / `ASSERT_LT`
  - `EXPECT_LE` / `ASSERT_LE`
  - `EXPECT_GT` / `ASSERT_GT`
  - `EXPECT_GE` / `ASSERT_GE`

### String Comparisons
- Use `EXPECT_STREQ` / `ASSERT_STREQ` for C strings, which compare string contents.
- Avoid `EXPECT_EQ` on C strings, which compares pointers, not contents.

### Floating-Point Comparisons
- Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ` for approximate equality with `float`.
- Use `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ` for `double`.
- Use `EXPECT_NEAR` when specifying a custom absolute tolerance.

---

## 4. Assertion Placement and Control Flow

### Avoid Fatal Assertions Inside Constructors or Destructors
Use `SetUp()` / `TearDown()` to perform assertions requiring fatal failures.

### Propagating Fatal Failures from Helper Functions
Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` to ensure that failures inside subroutines cause the calling test to fail or return early.

```cpp
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(DoComplexCheck());
```

### Skipping Tests at Runtime
Use `GTEST_SKIP()` with an explanation to conditionally skip tests based on runtime conditions.

```cpp
if (!FeatureEnabled()) {
  GTEST_SKIP() << "Feature disabled on current platform.";
}
```

---

## 5. Explicit Success and Failure

- `SUCCEED()` explicitly generates a success message. It documents intentional success.
- `FAIL()` generates a fatal failure and aborts the current function immediately.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` generates a nonfatal failure but continues execution.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Maintainable Tests

### 6.1 Single Responsibility
Write each test to verify a single behavior or contract. This increases clarity and reduces brittle tests.

### 6.2 Use Descriptive Names
Name tests and assertions clearly to indicate intent and expected behavior.

### 6.3 Avoid Over-Specification
Do not assert on irrelevant conditions. Keep expectations loose enough to accommodate valid code evolution.

### 6.4 Assert Early and Clearly
Place assertions where an error is easiest to diagnose and as soon as possible after detecting an issue.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Assertion Failures

### Missing or Incorrect Assertions
- If tests pass incorrectly, verify assertions cover all critical behavior.
- If tests fail too often, loosen matching criteria or split tests.

### Understanding Assertion Messages
- GoogleTest prints actual and expected values along with source locations.
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to stop at the failing assertion in a debugger.

### Assertion Failures in Helper Functions
- If failures occur silently within helpers, use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add contextual trace messages.

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Verifying user profile");
EXPECT_EQ(profile.id, expected_id);
```

## 8. Advanced Assertion Techniques

### Using Matchers
GoogleTest provides rich [matcher utilities](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/matchers.html): combine simple matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`, and use container matchers `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()` to write expressive tests.

### Custom Assertions Using `ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT`
Define predicate-format functions for complex validations with custom failure messages.

### Floating-Point Predicate-Format Functions
Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(FloatLE, value1, value2)` for approximate float comparisons.

### Regular Expression Matching
Use string matchers to compare output or error messages against regex patterns.

### Death Assertions
Use `EXPECT_DEATH` and related macros to test code that should terminate under specified conditions.

---

## 9. Examples

### 9.1 Simple Equality and String Assertions

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(StringTest, UserNameChecks) {
  const char* user = GetUser();
  EXPECT_STREQ(user, "admin");
}
```

### 9.2 Using Matchers for Containers

```cpp
using ::testing::ElementsAre;
using ::testing::_;

TEST(ContainerTest, ContainsExpectedValues) {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
  EXPECT_THAT(v, ElementsAre(1, _, 3));  // Matches any middle element
}
```

### 9.3 Predicate Assertion with Custom Message

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(NumberTest, CheckEven) {
  int val = 3;
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, val);
}
```
