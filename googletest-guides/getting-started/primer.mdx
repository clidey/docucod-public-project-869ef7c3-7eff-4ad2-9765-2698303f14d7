# GoogleTest Primer

## Introduction: Why GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is a versatile C++ testing framework designed with Google's practical needs in mind. It supports writing various types of tests that are independent, repeatable, well-organized, portable, and fast — all while giving detailed feedback on test failures to aid debugging.

### What GoogleTest Achieves for You

- **Isolates tests** by running each on separate objects, enabling you to identify the exact failing test instantly.
- **Organizes tests** into test suites reflecting your code’s logical structure, promoting maintainability and clarity.
- **Supports portability** across Linux, Windows, and Mac with various compilers and configurations.
- **Provides detailed failure information** without stopping the entire test run, allowing you to catch multiple issues in one cycle.
- **Automates test registration**, freeing you from managing test lists.
- **Boosts performance** through efficient resource sharing and setup/teardown handling.

If you’re acquainted with testing frameworks like JUnit or PyUnit, GoogleTest will feel familiar; if not, you can master the basics and start writing tests in about 10 minutes!

## Beware of the Nomenclature

GoogleTest terminology can be a bit confusing because it historically used *Test Case* and *Test Suite* interchangeably. Here's what you need to know:

| Meaning                                               | GoogleTest Term | ISTQB Term      |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Single test that exercises a condition and verifies results | `TEST()` or *Test*  | Test Case       |
| Group of related tests                                  | Test Suite / deprecated Test Case  | Test Suite       |

Note: GoogleTest prefers using *Test Suite* now instead of the older *Test Case* term.

## Basic Concepts

- **Assertions**: Statements checking conditions in your tests. They can succeed or fail (fatal or nonfatal).
- **Tests**: Functions using assertions to verify your code behaves as expected.
- **Test Suites**: Collections of related tests, grouped logically.
- **Test Fixtures**: Classes that allow sharing setup and teardown among tests in the same suite.
- **Test Program**: Contains multiple test suites.

You build your test program starting from assertions, assembling them into tests, then grouping tests into suites.

---

## Assertions

Assertions in GoogleTest look like function calls but are actually macros. They check conditions and provide detailed failure messages.

- Use `ASSERT_*` to generate *fatal failures* that immediately abort the current test function.
- Use `EXPECT_*` for *nonfatal failures*, allowing subsequent assertions in the test to run.

### Custom Failure Messages

Add custom messages by streaming with `<<`:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y have different sizes";
for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); ++i) {
  EXPECT_EQ(x[i], y[i]) << "Mismatch at index " << i;
}
```

### Common Assertions

GoogleTest provides a rich set:

- Boolean checks: `ASSERT_TRUE()`, `EXPECT_FALSE()`
- Equality: `ASSERT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NE()`
- String comparisons
- Floating-point comparisons
- Custom predicate assertions

(For a comprehensive list, see the GoogleTest [Assertions Reference](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/reference/assertions.md#assertions-reference)).

---

## Simple Tests

To write a simple test:

1. Use the `TEST()` macro with a Test Suite name and a Test name.
2. Inside the test body, write assertions to verify behavior.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Naming rules:
- Both suite and test names must be valid C++ identifiers.
- Avoid underscores `_` as they clash with internal naming (see FAQ).

GoogleTest runs all tests in all suites by default, grouping results by suite.

---

## Test Fixtures: Sharing Data Among Tests

When multiple tests operate on similar data or need common setup, a test fixture lets you reuse that configuration.

To create a fixture:

1. Derive a class from `testing::Test`.
2. Declare shared objects as class members.
3. Optionally override `SetUp()` to initialize objects before each test.
4. Optionally override `TearDown()` to clean resources after each test.

Use `TEST_F()` (instead of `TEST()`) to write tests that use the fixture:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Important notes:
- Each `TEST_F()` gets a fresh fixture object.
- Modifications in one test do not affect others.
- Use `ASSERT_*` when failure should stop a test early (e.g., to avoid dereferencing null).

---

## Invoking the Tests

- `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` register tests automatically.
- Run them all using the `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` macro, which:
  - Initializes fixtures,
  - Runs each test,
  - Handles setup and teardown.

Example:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

**Important:**
- Always return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to reflect pass/fail status.
- Call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` exactly once for correct behavior.

---

## Writing a Custom main()

Most users can link against the provided `gtest_main` library and avoid writing `main()`.

If custom pre-test setup is required, implement your own `main()` as shown:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);  // Initialize flags
  // Your custom setup code here
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Inside `main()`:
- Call `InitGoogleTest()` before running tests for command-line flag parsing.
- Return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`'s value.

Sample test fixture and test, illustrating custom setup, can be found in the primer.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use `EXPECT_*` to continue testing after failures where possible.
- Use `ASSERT_*` when subsequent code depends on a condition (to avoid crashes).
- Group related tests logically in test suites to maintain clarity.
- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent compilation issues.
- Prefer linking with `gtest_main` to avoid writing `main()` unless you need initial setup.
- Write clean, readable test names that describe the tested functionality clearly.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Ensure `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` spellings are correct (case-sensitive).
- Confirm all test fixture classes have a default constructor.
- Always return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.
- Avoid calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` multiple times.
- Use proper macros: `TEST()` for regular tests, `TEST_F()` for fixture tests.

If you encounter linker or runtime issues, check your build and link system configuration and confirm flags for threading and exceptions as applicable.
