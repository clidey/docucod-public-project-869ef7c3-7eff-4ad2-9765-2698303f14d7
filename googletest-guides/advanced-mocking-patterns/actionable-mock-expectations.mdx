# Working with Matchers, Actions, and Cardinalities

GoogleMock lets you precisely control and verify how mock methods behave and how they are expected to be called. This guide delivers a hands-on workflow for setting advanced expectations using **Matchers** to match arguments, **Actions** to define behaviors, and **Cardinalities** to specify the number of expected calls.

---

## 1. Understanding the Workflow

### What You'll Achieve
This guide teaches you how to **set powerful, flexible expectations** on mock methods by combining:
- **Matchers:** Specify argument patterns for function calls.
- **Actions:** Define what your mocks do when called (e.g., return values, side effects).
- **Cardinalities:** Control how many times a method is expected to be called.

By mastering these concepts, you gain full command over interaction verification in your tests.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with GoogleMock and C++ testing.
- A mock class with mocked methods declared using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Include `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files.

### Expected Outcome
- Able to write `EXPECT_CALL` statements with sophisticated argument matching.
- Specify method behaviors with `WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`, and custom actions.
- Control call expectations with cardinalities like `Times(Exactly(n))`, `AtLeast(n)`, and more.
- Utilize sequences and orderings through `InSequence()` and `After()`.

### Estimated Time
10-20 minutes to digest and apply the examples.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate - requires some basic GoogleMock knowledge.

## 2. Setting Argument Matchers

### Why Use Matchers?
You rarely want to verify exact argument values for every call. Matchers let you express flexible patterns, e.g., "any value", "greater than 10", "non-null pointers", or even custom predicates.

### Basic Examples
```cpp
using ::testing::_;        // Matches any value
using ::testing::Gt;       // Greater than
using ::testing::StrEq;    // String equality

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(5));          // Exactly 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(_));          // Any argument
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(Gt(10)));     // Argument > 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(StrEq("abc")));  // String "abc"
```

### Combining Matchers
Matchers can be combined logically:
```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Not;

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(AllOf(Gt(10), Not(15)))); // >10 and !=15
```

### Matching Multiple Arguments Together
If your mock method has multiple arguments and you want to check relations among arguments (e.g., first less than second), use `.With()` and multi-argument matchers:
```cpp
using ::testing::Lt;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // first arg < second arg
```

### Practical Tips
- Use `_` to indicate "any value" when arguments aren't important.
- Match only the arguments your test cares about.
- Define **custom matchers** if your logic is complex (see [MATCHER macro](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#writing-new-matchers)).

## 3. Defining Actions for Mock Methods

### What Are Actions?
Actions specify what happens when your mock method gets called with matching arguments. For example, returning a value, modifying an output parameter, throwing exceptions, or invoking a callback.

### Common Built-in Actions
```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::ReturnRef;
using ::testing::SetArgPointee;
using ::testing::DoAll;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(42));  // Returns 42 once

int flag = 0;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Mutate(_, _))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<1>(5), Return(true)));  // Sets arg1 to 5, returns true
```

### Action Variants
- `WillOnce(action)`: Defines behavior for the *next* matching call.
- `WillRepeatedly(action)`: Defines default behavior for calls after `WillOnce` actions.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetNumber())
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(3));
```

### Using Lambdas and Callables
If built-in actions donâ€™t fit your needs, define custom behavior:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_))
    .WillOnce([](int x) { return x * 2; });
```

### Invoking Callbacks or Arguments
You can invoke function or callback parameters:
```cpp
using ::testing::InvokeArgument;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, RegisterCallback(_))
    .WillOnce(InvokeArgument<0>(42));  // Invokes 0th argument with 42
```

### Tips & Best Practices
- Chain side-effect actions with `DoAll()`.
- Use `ReturnRef()` when returning references.
- Use `Invoke()` to call existing functions or methods.

## 4. Controlling Call Cardinalities

### What Is Cardinality?
Cardinality controls how many times you expect a mock method call to happen. This is expressed using the `.Times()` clause in `EXPECT_CALL` statements.

### Built-In Cardinalities
| Cardinality       | Meaning
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------
| `Exactly(n)` or `Times(n)` | Expect the call exactly `n` times.
| `AtLeast(n)`      | At least `n` calls.
| `AtMost(n)`       | At most `n` calls.
| `Between(m, n)`   | Between `m` and `n` calls (inclusive).
| `AnyNumber()`     | Any number of calls (0 or more).

### Examples
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).Times(Exactly(3));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(_)).Times(AtLeast(1));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Baz(5)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### Cardinality Inference Rules
If you omit `.Times()`, GoogleMock infers the expected number of calls:
- No `WillOnce()` or `WillRepeatedly()`: expects single call.
- N `WillOnce()` and no `WillRepeatedly()`: expects exactly N calls.
- N `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()`: expects at least N calls.

### Disallowing Calls
To assert a method is **never** called:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, ForbiddenMethod(_)).Times(0);
```

### Handling Call Overruns
Sometimes you want to retire expectations after saturation with `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky expectations that cause failures after exceeding call counts.

### Cardinality Best Practices
- Use precise cardinalities to catch unexpected call counts.
- Use `AnyNumber()` sparingly when you are sure calls don't matter.
- Combine with sequences and order constraints for complex control.

---

## 5. Managing Call Order and Sequences

GoogleMock offers powerful ways to express strict or partial ordering of expected calls.

### `InSequence`
Wrap your expectations in an `InSequence` object to enforce that the calls occur strictly in the order specified:
```cpp
{
  InSequence s;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Run());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Cleanup());
}
```

### `Sequence` Objects and `.InSequence()` Clause
When managing complex orderings, use `Sequence` objects and attach expectations to them:
```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Run()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Cleanup()).InSequence(s2);
```
This expresses that `Init` happens before `Run` and `Run` happens before `Cleanup`, but `Init` and `Cleanup` may run in any relative order with respect to calls outside these sequences.

### `.After()` Clause
Use `.After()` to specify that a call happens after other expectation(s):
```cpp
Expectation init = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Initialize());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Execute()).After(init);
```

### Best Practices
- Use sequences to enforce strict order when implementation contract requires it.
- Use `.After()` for partial ordering dependencies.
- Avoid over-constraining call order to keep tests maintainable.

## 6. Putting It All Together: A Real-World Scenario

Imagine you are testing a `MockDatabase` interface:

```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string&));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string&));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Disconnect, ());
};
```

### Expectation Example
```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::Exactly;
using ::testing::InSequence;

TEST(DatabaseTest, QuerySequence) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  {
    InSequence seq;

    EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("localhost"))
        .Times(Exactly(1))
        .WillOnce(Return(true));

    EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query(_))
        .Times(AtLeast(1))
        .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));

    EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Disconnect())
        .Times(Exactly(1));
  }

  // Code under test that calls Connect, Query, Disconnect in order
  MyDatabaseUser user(&mock_db);
  user.RunQueries();
}
```

This example:
- Matches exact arguments on `Connect`.
- Accepts any query string on `Query`, returning `42` every time.
- Enforces call order using `InSequence`.
- Controls call counts with cardinalities.

### Action Chaining & Side-Effects Example
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query(_))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(
         SetArgPointee<0>(100),   // Assume output param index 0
         Return(1)));            // Return 1
```

## 7. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues
- **Uninteresting calls warning:** If mock method calls occur without `EXPECT_CALL`, gMock warns unless a `NiceMock` is used.
- **Too few or too many calls:** Make sure `.Times()` matches expected usage.
- **Mismatch in argument matching:** Use verbose mode `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug which expectations are matched.
- **Order violations:** Use `InSequence` or `After` to fix ordering problems.

### Tips
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for setting default behavior without imposing expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify calls.
- Retire saturated expectations with `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky failures.

### Performance
- Limit number of expectations and sequences for faster test execution.
- Group related expectations logically.

### Alternatives & Extensions
- Define **custom matchers** and **custom actions** for tailored checking and mocking.
- Use **NiceMock**, **StrictMock**, or **NaggyMock** wrappers to control how uninteresting calls are handled.
