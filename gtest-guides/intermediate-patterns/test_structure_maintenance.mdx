# Organizing and Scaling Test Suites

## Overview

As your C++ project grows, maintaining clear, reliable, and efficient tests is crucial. This guide focuses narrowly on strategies to organize your GoogleTest test suites for scalability and maintainability. You'll learn how to structure your tests with parameterized tests, test fixtures, and suite organization best practices, ensuring your test codebase remains robust and easy to navigate.

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest basics such as writing simple tests using `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` (GoogleTest Primer).
- Your project has GoogleTest integrated—refer to the [Installation (CMake, Bazel, Manual)](/getting-started/setup-introduction/installation-options) guide if needed.
- C++ environment configured with C++17 or later.

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Create parameterized tests to run the same test logic with different data.
- Use test fixtures to share setup/teardown and resources among related tests.
- Organize tests into suites that map logically to your code.
- Apply best practices to keep tests reliable and scalable as your codebase grows.

## Time Estimate

Allow 20-30 minutes to understand these strategies and apply the sample patterns to your project.

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate—assumes knowledge of GoogleTest's simple and fixture-based tests.

# Step-by-Step Test Suite Organization

### 1. Group Related Tests into Test Suites

- Use the first argument in the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros to group logically related tests by functionality or feature area.
- Keep test suite names concise, descriptive, and without underscores (e.g., `FactorialTest`, `QueueTest`).

### 2. Use Test Fixtures to Share Test Setup and Data

- When multiple tests need the same setup, define a test fixture class deriving from `testing::Test`.
- Initialize shared test variables and resources in the fixture constructor or `SetUp()` method.
- Use `TEST_F()` instead of `TEST()` for tests that use the fixture.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q0_.Enqueue(1);
    q1_.Enqueue(2);
    q1_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsFirstInLine) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);  // Queue is empty

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  delete n;
}
```

**Tip:** GoogleTest creates a fresh fixture object for each test, ensuring isolation.

### 3. Parameterize Tests to Run with Multiple Inputs

- Use value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) to test the same logic with different data values.
- Derive the test fixture from `testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
- Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to provide parameter values.

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesVariousInputs) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GE(Factorial(n), 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    ValidInputs,
    FactorialTest,
    testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 8));
```

- Parameterized tests generate individual test instances per parameter value, clearly reported in test output.

**Best Practice:** Use meaningful names for instantiations and avoid overly complex parameter sets to keep output readable.

---

### 4. Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests for Repeated Logic Across Types

- Typed tests run the same test logic on a fixed set of types. Useful for template testing.
- Define a fixture as a class template and register types using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.
- Use `TYPED_TEST` to define tests that use the type parameter.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_ = 0;
};

typedef testing::Types<int, float, double> NumericTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, DefaultValueIsZero) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, static_cast<TypeParam>(0));
}
```

---

### 5. Suite-Level Setup and Teardown

- For expensive shared resources, define static members and implement `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` in the fixture.
- These methods run once before the first test and after the last test in the suite, respectively.

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_connection_ = new DatabaseConnection("my_db");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete db_connection_;
    db_connection_ = nullptr;
  }

  static DatabaseConnection* db_connection_;
};

DatabaseConnection* DatabaseTest::db_connection_ = nullptr;
```

**Tip:** Ensure tests do not alter shared state or reset it to avoid flaky tests.

---

### 6. Suite Organization Best Practices

- Arrange tests so suites map closely to code modules or classes.
- Avoid mixing tests with different fixtures in the same suite.
- Disable flaky tests temporarily with `DISABLED_` prefix, but track and fix them promptly.
- Use test naming conventions for clarity and to easily filter tests (e.g., `GTEST_FILTER=MySuite.*`).

---

### 7. Keeping Tests Reliable and Scalable

- Use `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*` when appropriate to continue testing even after failures.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information to failures inside loops or helper functions.
- Regularly run tests with `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` to identify order dependencies.
- For large test suites, consider splitting into multiple binaries or shards.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Failing Because Fixture Has No Default Constructor">
Ensure your test fixture class has a public default constructor. GoogleTest requires this to create test objects.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mixing TEST() and TEST_F() in Same Suite Causes Errors">
Use either `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` consistently within a suite. Mixing causes runtime errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Parameterized Tests Never Run">
Make sure you've instantiated your parameterized test suite with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`. Also, match parameter types carefully.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Name Collisions with Underscores in Test Names">
Avoid underscores in test suite or test names to prevent macro and internal name collisions as explained in the FAQ.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use meaningful, unique test names and suite names without underscores for compatibility and readability.
</Tip>

<Tip>
When running a large number of tests, leverage test filters and repetition flags to isolate and detect flaky tests early.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Be cautious with death tests and multithreaded code as they may introduce complexity and flakiness; isolate death tests into separate suites named `*DeathTest`.
</Warning>

## Next Steps & Resources

- Explore [Value-Parameterized Tests](../advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) and [Typed Tests](../advanced.md#typed-tests) for advanced parameterization patterns.
- Review [Test Fixtures](../primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests) for foundational setup/teardown concepts.
- Learn about [Global Test Environments](../advanced.md#global-set-up-and-tear-down) to set up global test state.
- Manage test execution and filtering with the flags detailed in [Running Test Programs: Advanced Options](../advanced.md#running-test-programs-advanced-options).

## Additional Examples

### Example: Using SCOPED_TRACE for Easier Debugging

```cpp
void ValidateItems(const std::vector<int>& items) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < items.size(); ++i) {
    SCOPED_TRACE("Item index: " + std::to_string(i));
    EXPECT_GT(items[i], 0) << "Item must be positive";
  }
}

TEST(ItemsTest, AllPositive) {
  std::vector<int> data = {1, -2, 3};
  ValidateItems(data);
}
```

This will print the failing item's index in the test output, helping pinpoint failures.

### Example: Instantiating Parameterized Tests with Custom Names

```cpp
class ColorTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};

TEST_P(ColorTest, IsValid) {
  std::string color = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValidColor(color));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    NamedColors,
    ColorTest,
    testing::Values("red", "green", "blue"),
    [](const testing::TestParamInfo<ColorTest::ParamType>& info) {
      return info.param;  // Test suffix is the color name
    });
```

This yields named test cases such as `NamedColors/ColorTest.IsValid/red`.
