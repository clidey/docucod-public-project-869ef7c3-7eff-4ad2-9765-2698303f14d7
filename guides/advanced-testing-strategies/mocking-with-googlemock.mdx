# Mocking C++ Objects with GoogleMock

## Overview
GoogleMock (gMock) enables C++ developers to create mock objects that imitate real classes for thorough, expressive unit testing. This guide dives into using GoogleMock specifically to create, configure, and verify mocks in your tests. It covers defining mock methods, setting expectations on calls, controlling mock behavior, and using specialized mock types like NiceMock and StrictMock for test discipline.

---

## 1. Understanding Mocks in GoogleMock

Mocks are test doubles programmed with expected *interactions* rather than behaviors. They track which methods are called, with what arguments, how many times, and in what order, giving you fine-grained control and verification of code interactions.

### Why use GoogleMock?
- Automates tedious and error-prone manual mock implementations.
- Provides a declarative, readable syntax for expectations.
- Enables early design and later testing refinement.
- Helps isolate tests from dependencies, improving speed and reliability.

### Basic Use Case Story
Imagine testing a graphics program that uses a `Turtle` interface for drawing. By mocking `Turtle`, you verify program behavior through expected method calls (`PenDown()`, `Forward()`, etc.) instead of comparing pixel outputs.

---

## 2. Creating Mock Classes

### Step 1: Define the Real Interface
A pure abstract class with virtual functions and a virtual destructor:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
  virtual void GoTo(int x, int y) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
  virtual int GetY() const = 0;
};
```

### Step 2: Declare Mock Class Using `MOCK_METHOD`
Derive your mock from the interface, define mocked methods with `MOCK_METHOD` in the public section:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

**Key notes:**
- Always mock virtual methods.
- Include `override` specifier for clarity and safety.
- Wrap argument types with parentheses if complex types contain commas.

### Where to Define Mock Classes
- For classes you own, defining mocks in test source files is fine.
- For external classes, define mocks in their package or a dedicated testing module.
- Prefer coding to interfaces to facilitate mocking.

## 3. Using Mocks in Tests

### Typical Workflow
1. Import gMock symbols, e.g., `using ::testing::_;`
2. Instantiate mock objects.
3. Set expectations using `EXPECT_CALL()`.
4. Exercise code that uses mocks.
5. Verify outcomes; gMock auto-verifies on destruction.

### Example Test
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsWithTurtle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(AtLeast(1));

  Painter painter(&turtle);

  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
}
```
- Here we check that `PenDown` is called at least once during drawing.
- If `PenDown` is never called, the test immediately fails with clear diagnostics.

### Important: Set Expectations *Before* Exercising the Mock
GoogleMock expects expectations to be declared before the mock methods are called. Setting expectations afterwards causes undefined behavior.

---

## 4. Setting Expectations

Expectations define which methods should be called and under which conditions.

### General Syntax
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers...))
    .Times(cardinality)
    .WillOnce(action)
    .WillRepeatedly(action);
```

- `matchers...`: Specify what arguments to expect, can use wildcards `_`, equality matchers, or complex predicates.
- `Times()`: How many times the call is expected.
- `WillOnce()`: Action to perform on specific calls.
- `WillRepeatedly()`: Action to perform on all subsequent calls.

### Matchers
- `_` matches anything.
- Use built-in matchers (e.g., `Eq(value)`, `Ge(min)`, `NotNull()`).
- Partial matches allow flexible expectations.

### Cardinalities
- `Exactly(n)` or numeric literal: expect exactly n calls.
- `AtLeast(n)`: expect at least n calls.
- `AtMost(n)`: expect at most n calls.
- `AnyNumber()`: no limit on number of calls.
- If `Times()` omitted, cardinality is inferred from action clauses.

### Actions
- Default is a default-constructed return value.
- Use `Return(val)`, `ReturnRef(var)`, `ReturnPointee(ptr)`, or custom lambdas.

### Multiple Expectations
- Newer expectations override older ones.
- Order expectations from general to specific.

### Ordering Calls
To require calls to occur in order:

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method1());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method2());
}
```

## 5. Controlling Mock Behavior for Test Discipline

### NiceMock, NaggyMock, StrictMock

- **NaggyMock (default)**: Warns on uninteresting calls (calls without explicit expectations).
- **NiceMock**: Suppresses uninteresting call warnings; cleaner test output.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as failures; enforces strict testing discipline.

Usage:
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockTurtle> nice_turtle;
StrictMock<MockTurtle> strict_turtle;
```

### When To Use
- Use **NiceMock** by default to avoid noisy warnings.
- Use **StrictMock** only when tests must fail on any unexpected call.

### Caveats
- These wrappers only influence mock methods defined via `MOCK_METHOD` directly in the class.
- Avoid nested wrappers like `NiceMock<StrictMock<T>>`.

---

## 6. Advanced Mocking Techniques

### Setting Default Actions with `ON_CALL`
`ON_CALL` defines default behavior for mock methods without asserting calls:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Method(_))
    .WillByDefault(Return(42));
```
This lets tests run smoothly without overly strict expectations yet simulates realistic behavior.

### Retiring Expectations
You can retire expectations after they are saturated using `.RetiresOnSaturation()`. This is particularly useful when you expect a specific number of calls but want later calls to match other expectations:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(7))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_))
    .Times(AnyNumber());
```

Calls to `Method(7)` beyond two will fall back to the catch-all expectation.

### Delegating to Fakes or Real Objects
You can delegate actions to a fake or the real implementation:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Method(_))
    .WillByDefault([this](int x) { return fake_.Method(x); });
```

Allows combining the benefits of mock verification with real behavior.

### Mocking Non-Virtual Methods
GoogleMock supports mocking non-virtual methods via standalone mock classes unrelated to the real class. Use templates or adapters to switch between real and mock implementations.

### Mocking Overloaded Methods
Mock all overloads explicitly, and use `using BaseClass::Method;` in mock class to bring unmocked overloads into scope to avoid hiding warnings.

### Mocking Move-Only Types
`MOCK_METHOD` supports methods accepting and returning move-only types like `std::unique_ptr`. Use lambdas or custom actions for multiple return values.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues
- **Expectations not set before calls:** Always define `EXPECT_CALL`s before exercising mock.
- **Uninteresting calls warnings:** Use `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress.
- **Mock leaks (no destruction):** Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj)` or manage lifetimes carefully.
- **Over-saturated calls:** Check if calls exceed expectations and add `.RetiresOnSaturation()` if appropriate.

### Tips for Success
- Keep expectations as general as possible to avoid brittle tests.
- Use sequences or `.After()` for order constraints.
- Use `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors, `EXPECT_CALL` for behaviors/tests you care about.
- Use mock verification (automatic on destruction, or use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations`) to detect incomplete or excessive calls.

## Code Snippet Summary
```cpp
// Mock interface
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

// Using mocks in a test
TEST(PaintTest, UsesTurtle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 20));
}

// Setting default behavior with ON_CALL
ON_CALL(turtle, GetX()).WillByDefault(Return(100));
```

<Tip>
Mock expectations must be set before exercising the code under test; setting them afterwards results in undefined behavior.
</Tip>

<Note>
Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, and `StrictMock` to treat them as errors, controlling test strictness.
</Note>

<Warning>
Mock objects should have virtual destructors to avoid undefined behavior and memory leaks.
</Warning>
