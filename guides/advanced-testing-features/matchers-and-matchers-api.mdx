# Powerful Validation with Matchers

Harness the flexibility of the GoogleTest matchers API for complex, readable expectations. Explore built-in and user-defined matchers for verifying a wide range of types and data structures with clear, descriptive diagnostics.

---

## 1. Introduction to Matchers

Matchers are the backbone of flexible and expressive validation in GoogleTest. They allow you to specify detailed expectations on values, providing clear, human-readable failure messages that describe how and why assertions fail.

By using matchers, you move beyond simple Boolean checks, enabling tests that read like natural language and accurately describe the intent of your validation logic.

### Key Benefits of Using Matchers
- Write tests that clearly express *what* is expected rather than *how* to verify it.
- Combine simple matchers to build complex validation logic.
- Receive detailed failure explanations, assisting rapid debugging.
- Reuse matchers across tests to improve maintainability.

---

## 2. Core Concepts and Usage

### 2.1. What Problems Do Matchers Solve?
Matcher expressions go beyond simple equality or relational comparisons. They:
- Check for substring presence, string prefixes/suffixes.
- Match containers with element-level checks.
- Validate specific object properties and nested fields.
- Combine multiple conditions using logical combinators.

### 2.2. Using Matchers in Assertions
GoogleTest integrates matchers with assertions via `EXPECT_THAT` and `ASSERT_THAT`. These macros verify that a value satisfies a matcher:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(actual_value, matcher_expression);
ASSERT_THAT(actual_value, matcher_expression);
```

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(username, StartsWith("admin"));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, ElementsAre(1, _, Gt(10)));
```

If the assertion fails, GoogleTest prints the value and a descriptive message from the matcher, making test reports easier to understand.

## 3. Built-In Matchers Overview

GoogleTest provides an extensive library of built-in matchers suitable for common validation needs.

### 3.1. Wildcard Matchers
- **`_`**: Matches anything. Use when argument value is irrelevant.
- **`A<T>()` / `An<T>()`**: Matches any value of type `T`.

### 3.2. Comparison Matchers
- `Eq(v)` / implicit value: Equal to `v`.
- `Ne(v)`: Not equal to `v`.
- `Lt(v)`, `Le(v)`, `Gt(v)`, `Ge(v)`: Less than, Less or equal, Greater than, Greater or equal comparisons.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue(Gt(0)));
```

### 3.3. String Matchers
- `StrEq(s)`, `StrNe(s)`: Compare strings for equality / inequality.
- `StrCaseEq(s)`, `StrCaseNe(s)`: Case-insensitive string comparisons.
- `HasSubstr(sub)`: Checks if string contains substring `sub`.
- `StartsWith(prefix)`, `EndsWith(suffix)`: Check string prefixes or suffixes.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(greeting, StartsWith("Hello"));
```

### 3.4. Container Matchers
- `ElementsAre(m1, m2, ..., mN)`: Matches container whose elements match each matcher in order.
- `UnorderedElementsAre(...)`: Like `ElementsAre` but order does not matter.
- `Contains(m)`: Checks if container contains an element that matches `m`.
- `SizeIs(m)`: Checks container size against matcher `m`.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(vec, ElementsAre(1, _, Gt(5)));
EXPECT_THAT(set, Contains(42));
```

### 3.5. Object and Pointer Matchers
- `Field(&Class::member, m)`: Matches an object whose member matches `m`.
- `Property(&Class::getter, m)`: Matches an object whose getter method returns a value matching `m`.
- `Pointee(m)`: Matches a pointer (raw or smart) pointing to a value matching `m`.
- `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`: Pointer nullity checks.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(person, Field(&Person::age, Ge(18)));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, ProcessData(Pointee(StrEq("OK"))));
```

### 3.6. Logical Combinators
- `Not(m)`: Negates matcher `m`.
- `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)`: Matches if all matchers match.
- `AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)`: Matches if any matcher matches.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(100)));
```

### 3.7. Special Matchers
- `Truly(predicate)`: Use a custom unary predicate function or functor.
- `Ref(var)`: Matches references to the specified variable.
- `EqByRef(var)`: Matches a value equal to that referenced by `var` (via Ref).

---

## 4. Advanced Usage Patterns

### 4.1. Combining Matchers for Complex Validation
Matchers can be nested and combined in expressive ways. For example, validating a vector of objects where some fields meet criteria and the size is constrained:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(users, AllOf(SizeIs(Le(10)), Each(Field(&User::age, Ge(18)))));
```

### 4.2. Matching Tuples and Pairs
Use matchers like `Pair(m1, m2)` to validate pairs, and `FieldsAre(...)` to validate tuples or structs with structured bindings:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(entry, Pair(Gt(0), StrEq("active")));
EXPECT_THAT(record, FieldsAre(_, HasSubstr("success"), _));
```

### 4.3. Matching Arguments of Mock Methods
Matchers can be passed into `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expectations on mock method arguments, enabling fine-grained behavioral verification.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoWork(Ge(50), NotNull()));
```

## 5. Writing Custom Matchers

While built-in matchers cover most needs, GoogleTest enables defining custom matchers easily:

### 5.1. Using `MATCHER` Macro
A concise way to define a custom matcher.

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "Checks divisibility by 7") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}
...
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy7());
```

### 5.2. Parameterized Matchers
Use `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, etc. to create matchers with parameters.

```cpp
MATCHER_P(InRange, range, "Checks if value is in range") {
  return arg >= range.first && arg <= range.second;
}
...
EXPECT_THAT(value, InRange(std::make_pair(10, 20))); 
```

### 5.3. Writing Matcher Classes
For highly reusable and complex matchers, write a matcher class implementing:
- `MatchAndExplain()`
- `DescribeTo()`
- `DescribeNegationTo()`

and return it wrapped in `Matcher<T>`.

### 5.4. Important Matcher Constraints
- Matchers must be pure functions: no side effects.
- Be mindful when accessing pointers (check for null).
- Provide meaningful descriptions.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### 6.1. Common Issues
- Mismatched argument types or matcher types cause compile errors.
- Using matchers with incompatible function signatures.
- Over-specifying expectations leading to brittle tests.

### 6.2. Best Practices
- Use `_` to ignore unimportant arguments.
- Use `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors; reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you want to verify.
- Combine matchers logically for clear, intent-focused tests.
- Share complex matcher instances via variables for reusability.

### 6.3. Performance Considerations
- Matcher construction is lightweight; copying is efficient due to internal references.
- Avoid expensive operations in matchers as they may be invoked multiple times.

### 6.4. Tips
- Use `ExplainMatchResult()` to get detailed reasons why a matcher succeeded or failed.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed mock call logging.

TEST(GraphTest, MovesTurtleCorrectly) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  // Expect the turtle to move to a point with x == 5 and y >= 10.
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GoTo(Field(&std::pair<int,int>::first, 5), Ge(10)));

  // Expect 3 calls to GetX(), returning 100, then 200, then 300.
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(100))
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(200))
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(300));

  // Exercises code that calls GoTo and GetX.
}
```
