# Writing Maintainable Tests

## Introduction

This guide helps you write tests that are easy to understand, robust against change, and maintainable throughout your project's lifetime. You'll learn how to structure and name your tests clearly, isolate tests to prevent flakiness, reduce brittleness, and keep test suites manageable as they grow.

By applying these recommendations, your tests will clearly communicate intent, catch regressions effectively, and minimize unnecessary breaks during refactoring or feature addition.

---

## 1. Principles of Test Maintainability

### 1.1 Clear and Consistent Naming

- Use **descriptive names** for test suites and test cases reflecting the behavior or feature under test.
- Follow consistent naming conventions aligned with C++ style guides: avoid underscores; use camel case or Pascal case.
- Names should express *what* behavior is being tested and under *which condition*.

**Example:**
```cpp
// Bad:
TEST(FooTest, Test1) { ... }

// Good:
TEST(FooTest, ReturnsFalseWhenInputIsNull) { ... }
```


### 1.2 Test Isolation

- Tests must run independently without relying on external state or the order of execution.
- Use **test fixtures** (`TEST_F`) to set up shared context freshly for each test.
- Avoid global or static mutable state. If unavoidable, reset it explicitly between tests.
- Ensure `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` prepare and clean up the environment.


### 1.3 Minimize Test Fragility

- Write tests that verify behavior rather than internal implementation details.
- Avoid overspecifying expectations, especially when mocking.
- Use **wildcard matchers (`_`)** for uninteresting mock method arguments.
- Utilize `ON_CALL()` to set default mock behaviors and reserve `EXPECT_CALL()` for critical interactions you want to verify.
- Prefer sequences and `InSequence` blocks only when the order matters.


### 1.4 Manage Test Suite Growth

- Group related tests logically into suites and fixtures.
- Keep fixtures focused and small; share only meaningful setup.
- Remove duplicate test logic by extracting helper functions.
- Regularly review and refactor test code alongside production code.

<Tip>
Maintaining good test hygiene pays dividends by preventing flaky tests and speeding up your development workflow.

## 2. Writing Readable Tests

### 2.1 Naming Conventions

- Test Suite names correspond to the class or function under test.
- Test case names describe the specific condition and expected outcome.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, ReturnsOneForZeroInput) { ... }
```

### 2.2 Use of Assertions

- Use `EXPECT_*` for non-fatal failures; lets tests continue to collect failures.
- Use `ASSERT_*` for conditions that must cause immediate test abort (e.g. null pointer before dereferencing).
- Add custom failure messages with `<<` for clarity.

### 2.3 Test Structure

- Arrange: Prepare all necessary preconditions and inputs.
- Act: Perform the action being tested.
- Assert: Verify that the output or state meets expectations.

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, HandlesEmptyString) {
  Foo foo;                               // Arrange
  auto result = foo.DoSomething("");  // Act
  EXPECT_TRUE(result);                   // Assert
}
```

## 3. Organizing Tests and Mocking

### 3.1 Using Test Fixtures

- Create fixture classes deriving from `testing::Test`.
- Initialize test data in the constructor or `SetUp()`.
- Clean up resources in `TearDown()` or destructor.

Example:
```cpp
class QueueTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> queue_;

  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(1);
    queue_.Enqueue(2);
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsFirstElement) {
  int* val = queue_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 1);
  delete val;
}
```

### 3.2 Effective Mock Usage

- Define mocks using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro inside your mock classes.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set common default behavior.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to assert critical interactions.
- Use matchers wisely; `_` for ignoring arguments, specific matchers for targeted checks.
- Apply sequences (`InSequence`) only if call order is essential.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid expectation shadowing and brittleness.

Example:
```cpp
 EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenDown())          // Expects at least one call
     .Times(::testing::AtLeast(1));
```

## 4. Best Practices to Reduce Test Brittleness

### 4.1 Avoid Tight Coupling to Implementation

- Write tests that focus on *what* the code does, not *how* it does it.
- Resist the temptation to test private members or internal state directly.

### 4.2 Avoid Excessive Expectations in Mocks

- Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior.
- Limit `EXPECT_CALL` only to interactions you need to verify.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting call warnings.

### 4.3 Expectation Order and Sequencing

- Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects when validating call order is necessary.
- Use partial ordering (`After` clause) to express dependencies without rigid full sequences.

### 4.4 Use of `RetiresOnSaturation`

- Prevent one expectation from indefinitely shadowing others by retiring it once saturated.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(7))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(::testing::_))
    .Times(::testing::AnyNumber());
```

## 5. Practical Examples

### 5.1 Naming and Organizing Tests

```cpp
// Test for a Calculator class

TEST(CalculatorTest, ReturnsZeroForEmptyInput) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Compute(""), 0);
}

TEST(CalculatorTest, CorrectlyAddsTwoNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Compute("1+1"), 2);
}
```

### 5.2 Using Fixtures

```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, SubtractsCorrectly) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Compute("5-3"), 2);
}
```

### 5.3 Mocking with Expectations

```cpp
class MockDatabase : public DatabaseInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetRecordCount, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(DatabaseClientTest, ConnectsAndQueries) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillByDefault(::testing::Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, GetRecordCount())
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  DatabaseClient client(&mock_db);
  EXPECT_TRUE(client.Initialize());
  EXPECT_EQ(client.RecordCount(), 42);
}
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 6.1 Test Failures Due to Order of Calls

If using sequences, verify calls happen in the expected order.

### 6.2 Unexpected Calls to Mock Methods

- Check if `EXPECT_CALL` are properly set before the tested code runs.
- Consider using `NiceMock` if warnings on uninteresting calls are unwanted.

### 6.3 Test Interference

- Make sure tests do not share mutable global state.
- Use fresh test fixtures for each test.

### 6.4 Mock Actions and Side Effects

- Beware that actions in `WillOnce()` are evaluated once when set, not each time called.
- Use lambdas or custom actions to generate dynamic behavior.
