# Test Fixtures & Code Reuse

## Overview

Test fixtures are a cornerstone of effective C++ testing with GoogleTest. They allow you to share **common setup**, **teardown**, and **helper code** across multiple tests within the same test suite, enabling clearer, more maintainable, and consistent test code. This guide will walk you through how to create, use, and optimize test fixtures, focusing on practical scenarios where sharing code eliminates duplication and enforces a consistent test state.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Learn how to define a test fixture class for sharing common test data setup and cleanup.
- Understand how to write tests using `TEST_F()` that use your fixture.
- Discover best practices for resource management and state consistency using test fixtures.
- Gain tips for avoiding common pitfalls like shared state contamination.

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest macros like `TEST()` and assertions (`EXPECT_*`/`ASSERT_*`).
- A working GoogleTest environment set up to compile and run tests.

### Time Estimate

10-20 minutes for reading and hands-on experimentation.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Why Use Test Fixtures?

### The Problem Without Fixtures

If your tests share setup steps or common objects, duplicating that code across many tests leads to:

- Maintenance overhead when changes are needed,
- Risk of errors and inconsistencies,
- Less readable test code.

### How Fixtures Help

A **test fixture** bundles setup and teardown logic and shared objects into a class. GoogleTest creates a new instance of this class for each test, ensuring tests are isolated yet code is centralized. This promotes **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and improves test clarity.

---

## Creating a Test Fixture

To define a test fixture:

1. Create a C++ class deriving from `testing::Test`.
2. Add member variables for the objects or data your tests will share.
3. Implement a constructor or override `SetUp()` for setup logic.
4. Optionally implement a destructor or override `TearDown()` for cleanup.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple Queue for demonstration
template <typename T>
class Queue {
 public:
  Queue() {}
  void Enqueue(const T& element) { data_.push_back(element); }
  T* Dequeue() {
    if (data_.empty()) return nullptr;
    T* front = new T(data_.front());
    data_.erase(data_.begin());
    return front;
  }
  size_t size() const { return data_.size(); }

 private:
  std::vector<T> data_;
};

// Define a fixture for Queue<int>
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Setup some sample queues
    // q0_ is empty
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  // Queues accessible to all tests
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};
```

---

## Writing Tests Using Fixtures: `TEST_F`

Use the `TEST_F(TestFixtureClassName, TestName)` macro to write tests that utilize the fixture. GoogleTest will:

- Instantiate the fixture class,
- Call the constructor,
- Call `SetUp()` if overridden,
- Run your test code,
- Call `TearDown()` if overridden,
- Destroy the fixture instance.

Example tests for the above fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr) << "Expected non-null pointer";
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each test runs independently with a fresh fixture instance, ensuring no cross-test state pollution.

## Advanced Fixture Usage

### Setup vs Constructor, Teardown vs Destructor

- Use the constructor and destructor for **simple, quick setup and teardown** of member variables.
- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` if you need to perform actions that can fail or require GoogleTest assertions.

> **Important**: GoogleTest constructs a new fixture object for *each* test. Each test runs with a clean state.

### Sharing Resources Across the Entire Test Suite

If some resources are expensive to create and are read-only or safely shared, implement static setup and teardown using `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` (public static methods in the fixture class). GoogleTest will call these once before and after all tests in that suite.

```cpp
class ExpensiveFixture : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    expensive_resource_ = new Resource();
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete expensive_resource_;
  }
 protected:
  static Resource* expensive_resource_;
};

Resource* ExpensiveFixture::expensive_resource_ = nullptr;
```

### Best Practices

- Keep test fixtures focused and small; avoid bloated, all-purpose fixtures.
- Reset or reinitialize any mutable shared data to the same state for each test.
- Clean up any heap-allocated memory in `TearDown()` to prevent leaks.
- Prefer `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` over constructor/destructor when you want to use assertions to validate setup or teardown.

---

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### Remember: Fixture Instance Per Test

Each test is run with its own fixture instance. Modifications to fixture members are **not** shared between tests. Donâ€™t expect state changes in one test to affect another.

### Spelling and Casing

- The setup method must be `SetUp()` with a capital `U`, not `Setup()`.
- Similarly, `TearDown()` must be capitalized correctly.

### Using Assertions in Constructor/Destructor?

GoogleTest does **not** allow fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) in constructors or destructors. Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for any assertions.

### Default Constructor Requirement

Fixtures must have a default constructor (the compiler-generated one or explicitly defined) because GoogleTest creates them dynamically.

### Sharing Read-Only Data

Use static members and `SetUpTestSuite()` / `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive resources shared without mutation.

### Derived Fixtures

You can derive test fixtures from other fixtures to extend or specialize setup logic. Use `TEST_F()` with the derived class name.

```cpp
class BaseFixture : public testing::Test { ... };
class DerivedFixture : public BaseFixture { ... };

TEST_F(DerivedFixture, TestInDerived) { ... }
```

---

## Summary

Test fixtures are the best way to share setup and teardown code in GoogleTest. They streamline test code, prevent duplication, and provide clear test cases with predictable and isolated states. Use `TEST_F()` to create tests that benefit from the fixture's shared setup, and consider `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive shared resources.

## Quick Reference

<Steps>
<Step title="Define your fixture class">
Derive from `testing::Test`; add member variables and override `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` if needed.
</Step>
<Step title="Write tests using `TEST_F`">
Use `TEST_F(FixtureClass, TestName)` to write tests accessing fixture members.
</Step>
<Step title="Store and manage shared resources">
Use static members and `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for once-per-suite initialization.
</Step>
<Step title="Run tests">
Run your test binary normally; GoogleTest handles fixture lifecycle.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Avoid mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` with the same suite name - they have different semantics and lead to errors.
</Tip>

<Note>
Remember to always call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return value in your `main()` - it ensures test results are correctly communicated.
