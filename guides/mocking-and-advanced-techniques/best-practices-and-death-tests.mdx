# Mocking Best Practices & Death Tests

## Introduction

This guide offers practical best practices for using GoogleMock effectively in your tests, focusing on mock organization, expectations management, and leveraging death tests to validate error paths. By mastering these practices, you will write more robust, maintainable, and expressive tests that clearly verify interactions and critical failure scenarios.

---

## Organizing Mocks for Scalability and Maintainability

### 1. Define Mock Classes Purposefully

- **Mock only what you own:** Avoid mocking third-party or external classes unless necessary. Instead, create adapter interfaces that you control, facilitating manageable mocks.

- **Separate mocks by domain or module:** Group mocks logically in dedicated directories or namespaces to reduce clutter and ease maintenance.

- **Use inheritance and composition wisely:** Consider abstract base mock classes for shared behaviors and use composition to combine mocks for complex collaborators.

### 2. Placement of Mock Definitions

- **Put mocks close to the code under test:** If you own the interface, place the mock class in the same package or repository area where the interface is defined.

- **Avoid putting mocks solely in test files:** This can lead to brittle tests when the interface evolves. Centralizing mocks promotes reuse and single points of update.

- **Use `.h` and `.cc` files for mock implementation:** Declare mocks in headers and optionally define constructors or helper functions in `.cc` files to improve compile times.

### 3. Use Mock Types (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`) Appropriately

- **Prefer `NiceMock` for general use:** It suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls, making tests less brittle to refactorings.

- **Use `NaggyMock` during development or debugging:** It warns on unexpected calls, helping detect unexpected interactions early.

- **Apply `StrictMock` when enforcing strict interaction policies:** It treats uninteresting calls as errors, useful in highly sensitive or safety-critical components.

<Tip>
Always set your mock type at the outermost level, e.g., `NiceMock<MockFoo>`, so it behaves as intended across all mocked methods.
</Tip>

### 4. Clear and Concise Expectations

- **Set expectations with intention:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify the interaction.

- **Use `ON_CALL` for default/mock behaviors:** It defines how mocks respond but does not enforce call counts.

- **Avoid over-specifying matchers:** Use `_` or generic matchers where argument values are irrelevant to the test intent.

- **Organize expectations to express order or dependencies:** Use `InSequence` and `After` clauses to enforce call ordering selectively.

### 5. Leveraging Sequences and Ordering

- Use `InSequence` to require strict ordering among calls within its scope.
- Use multiple `Sequence` objects and the `.InSequence(s1, s2)` clause to specify partial orderings.
- Combine `After()` with `Expectation` or `ExpectationSet` to express complex ordering.

### 6. Retiring Expectations

- Apply `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations with bounded cardinality to retire them once the invocation limit is met.
- This flexibility allows newer or more general expectations to match subsequent calls, improving test resilience.

## Death Tests: Verifying Critical Failure Paths

### Purpose and Use Cases

Death tests verify that your code correctly terminates (crashes or aborts) under invalid or fatal conditions, such as failing invariants or preconditions.

Use death tests to:

- Ensure assertion macros or checks cause termination when invalid states occur.
- Test system behavior under unrecoverable errors explicitly.

### Writing Death Tests

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH` macros with a statement and a matcher for the expected error message.
- Enclose code that should cause termination inside a block `{ ... }` if multiple lines.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ Initialize(nullptr); }, "null pointer");
```

### Death Test Styles

- **Fast style (default):** Uses `fork()` or equivalent to spawn subprocess to run the death test. Runs faster but less thread safe.
- **Threadsafe style:** Runs the test binary with specific flags in a new process. Safer with threads but slower.
- Choose style programmatically using `GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");`.

### Guidelines

- Name test suites containing death tests with the suffix `DeathTest` for correct ordering and handling.
- Avoid running death tests in multi-threaded contexts where possible.
- Be mindful that side effects in death tests are not propagated back to the parent process.

## Best Practices and Tips

### When to Use `EXPECT_CALL` vs. `ON_CALL`

- Use `ON_CALL` to set default mock method behavior without enforcing call counts.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to verify a method *is* called with specific parameters and times.
- Avoid unnecessary `EXPECT_CALL`s which can cause brittle, overly constrained tests.

### Avoid Expectation Stickiness Pitfalls

- By default, expectations are "sticky"; they remain active even after their expected calls are met.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to ensure expectations are removed when fulfilled.

### Handling Overloaded and Const Methods

- Mock all overloads you intend to use to avoid compiler hiding warnings.
- Use `MOCK_METHOD` with the correct const qualifiers.
- Use `Const()` wrapper in `EXPECT_CALL` for const method mock calls.

### Managing Mock Object Lifetimes

- Always ensure mock objects are destroyed to trigger expectation verifications.
- For heap-allocated mocks owned externally, use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations` to prevent silent test pass on mock leaks.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak` if mocks are intentionally leaked.

### Debugging and Diagnosing Failing Tests

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed match information and call traces.
- Interpret unexpected and uninteresting call warnings carefully; they often indicate missing or incorrect expectations.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context when testing helper functions.

### Combining Mocks and Fakes

- Delegate default mock behavior to fake implementations in cases where existing complex fakes exist.
- Use delegation cautiously as mixing mocks and fakes may signal design complexity.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                                  | Cause                                     | Solution                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Unexpected real method called          | Method not declared `virtual`             | Make methods virtual or use non-virtual mocking with templates |
| Expectation not satisfied              | Expectations set after call or too strict | Set expectations before calls, loosen matchers or cardinalities |
| Heapcheck failure with mock destruction | Non-virtual destructor in mocked interface | Declare destructor `virtual` in base class |
| Warnings for uninteresting calls      | Methods called without `EXPECT_CALL`     | Add `EXPECT_CALL` or switch to `NiceMock` when calls are allowed |
| Mock method name conflicts with macros | Conflicts like `#define Method MethodW`   | Use fully qualified names or undef macros during tests |

## Practical Example

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
};

TEST(PaintTest, DrawsCircle) {
  using ::testing::InSequence;
  using ::testing::_;
  using ::testing::AtLeast;

  MockTurtle turtle;
  {
    InSequence s;
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Turn(360));
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
  }

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
}

TEST(FatalTest, CrashesOnNull) {
  EXPECT_DEATH({ Initialize(nullptr); }, "null pointer");
}
```

## Summary

Efficient mock-based testing requires careful organization of mocks and clear, intentional expectation setting. Selecting the correct mock type (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`) is vital for balancing test strictness and maintainability. Death tests offer a structured way to validate critical failure behaviors by verifying that error conditions properly terminate the process. Mastering these best practices empowers you to build robust and reliable tests that make your code safer and easier to maintain.
