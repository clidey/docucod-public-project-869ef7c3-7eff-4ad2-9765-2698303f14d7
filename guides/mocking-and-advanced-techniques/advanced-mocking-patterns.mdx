# Advanced Mocking Patterns and Practices

Delve into advanced GoogleMock features including custom matchers, actions, call expectation control, usage of `NiceMock` and `StrictMock`, and strategies for managing complex dependencies. This guide emphasizes creating mock setups that are maintainable, readable, and highly effective.

---

## 1. Introduction

When unit testing complex C++ systems, mocks often become more than simple stand-ins. Advanced mocking patterns empower you to precisely specify behaviors, control invocation sequences, and elegantly manage dependencies. Mastering these patterns leads to clearer tests that are easier to maintain and diagnose.

This guide focuses exclusively on advanced mocking features supported by GoogleMock (gMock), including:

- Custom matcher and action creation
- Controlling call expectations and sequencing
- Using `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` for uninteresting call behavior
- Handling complex mock dependencies


## 2. Custom Matchers: Precise Argument Validation

Matchers define how argument values are evaluated against expectations. The powerful default matchers can cover many cases but sometimes fail to express nuanced domain logic. Custom matchers allow you to define tailored validation logic compactly and clearly.

### Why Use Custom Matchers?
- Check complex conditions involving multiple fields or cross-argument relationships.
- Produce meaningful error descriptions when expectations fail.
- Reuse validation logic across multiple tests consistently.

### Creating a Simple Custom Matcher
You can define a matcher using the `MATCHER` or `MATCHER_P` macros with expressive failure messages.

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// Match integers divisible by 7.
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}

// Usage in an EXPECT_CALL
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, SomeMethod(IsDivisibleBy7()));
```

### Defining Parameterized Matchers
For matchers requiring parameters, use `MATCHER_P` or `MATCHER_Pk`.

```cpp
MATCHER_P(InRange, bounds, "") {
  return arg >= bounds.first && arg <= bounds.second;
}

EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, CheckValue(InRange(std::make_pair(10, 20))));
```

### Best Practices
- Use expressive descriptions in matchers for better failure diagnostics.
- Avoid side effects in matcher code as matchers may be invoked multiple times.
- Factor complex validation into reusable matcher classes or functions.


## 3. Defining Custom Actions: Beyond Returning Values

Actions specify what a mock method does when called. While built-in actions (e.g., `Return()`, `SetArgPointee()`) are convenient, custom actions let you implement complex behaviors such as stateful updates, side effects, or conditional logic.

### Simple Custom Action with a Lambda

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_))
    .WillOnce([](int x) {
      // Custom code executed on call
      Process(x);
      return x * 2;
    });
```

### Creating Reusable Custom Action Classes

Define a class implementing the call operator matching the method signature:

```cpp
struct IncrementCounter {
  int counter = 0;
  int operator()() {
    return ++counter;
  }
};

EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetCount()).WillRepeatedly(IncrementCounter());
```

### Using Polymorphic Actions
Use `MakePolymorphicAction()` to create generic actions useful across different mock signatures.

### Combining Multiple Actions
Use `DoAll()` to chain multiple actions where only the last return value is significant.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Mutate(_))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<0>(42), Return(true)));
```

### Tips
- Ensure return types match the mocked method's return type.
- Avoid actions with side effects that make tests brittle.


## 4. Controlling Call Expectations

Robust tests often require fine-grained control over how many times and in what order mock methods are invoked.

### Cardinalities with `Times()`
Specify how often a method is expected:

- `Times(Exactly(n))` or `Times(n)`: exactly n calls
- `Times(AtLeast(n))`: minimum n calls
- `Times(AtMost(n))`: maximum n calls
- `AnyNumber()`: zero or more calls

**Omitting `Times()`** lets gMock infer it based on your usage of `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()`.

### Ordering Calls

#### Sequences with `InSequence`
Group expectations into a sequence, enforcing order:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

All calls must occur in declared order or the test fails.

#### Partial Ordering with `After()`
Define dependencies between expectations without a strict linear order:

```cpp
Expectation e1 = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Start()).After(e1);
```

Call to `Start()` only valid after `Init()`.

### Retiring Expectations with `RetiresOnSaturation()`
By default, expectations remain active even after being satisfied. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to deactivate them immediately upon saturation, allowing other expectations to match subsequently.

### Multiple Expectations on Same Method
More recent expectations override earlier ones. Use ordering and cardinality control to manage conflicts.


## 5. Using NiceMock and StrictMock

Mock objects can vary in how they treat unexpected or uninteresting calls.

### NaggyMock (Default)
- Warns when methods are called without expectations.
- Helps detect unplanned calls while allowing tests to continue.

### NiceMock
- Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Useful when you only care about some methods and want cleaner output.
- Usage:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockClass> mock;
```

### StrictMock
- Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.
- Useful to enforce strict interaction contracts.
- Usage:

```cpp
StrictMock<MockClass> mock;
```

### Important Caveats
- `NiceMock`/`StrictMock` only affect methods without expectations (uninteresting calls), not unexpected calls.
- They only work reliably when mock methods are defined directly using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro in the mock class.
- Avoid nesting `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<Mock>>`).


## 6. Managing Complex Dependencies and Mock Lifecycles

Real projects often require managing multiple mock objects with complex interaction patterns.

### Sequences and Partial Orderings
Leverage `Sequence` objects and `.InSequence()` to define linear or partial orderings among expectations. This helps verify protocol adherence and logically related interactions.

### Using `After()` for DAG-Like Dependencies
`After()` allows defining arbitrary dependency graphs among expectations, providing flexible ordering controls.

### Retiring Expectations for State Transitions
Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to model stateful interactions where certain expectations become invalid after some calls.

### Avoiding Leaked Mocks and Forcing Verification
Mock objects automatically verify expectations upon destruction. If mocks leak (not destroyed), verification won't happen.

Force verification explicitly when necessary:

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
```

Suppress leak errors (not recommended) with:

```cpp
Mock::AllowLeak(&mock);
```

### Delegating Calls to Real or Fake Objects
To combine mocks with real or fake implementations, use `ON_CALL()` to forward calls explicitly.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Method(_)).WillByDefault([&real](Args... args) {
  return real.Method(args...);
});
```


## 7. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Set expectations before invoking mock methods.** Interleaving `EXPECT_CALL()` and mock calls causes undefined behavior.
- **Minimize over-specification.** Avoid enforcing too strict expectations; prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors.
- **Use sequences to clarify order where necessary.** Don't rely on implicit ordering.
- **Avoid mocking methods you don't own when possible.** Consider interface adapters.
- **Understand difference between uninteresting vs unexpected calls:** uninteresting - no expectation set; unexpected - no matching expectation found.
- **Use verbose flags (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to debug matching issues.**


## 8. Example Scenario: Combining Advanced Features

Suppose you have a mock representing a network connection that should receive messages in a specific order and return varying results based on message content.

```cpp
class MockConnection {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(void, SendMessage, (const std::string&), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, ReceiveMessage, (), ());
};

TEST(NetworkTest, ComplexInteraction) {
  MockConnection mock;

  Sequence s;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Connect())
      .Times(1)
      .InSequence(s);

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SendMessage(_))
      .Times(AtLeast(1))
      .InSequence(s);

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, ReceiveMessage())
      .WillOnce(Return("ACK"))
      .WillRepeatedly(Return("NACK"))
      .InSequence(s)
      .RetiresOnSaturation();

  // Use NiceMock to suppress warnings on other uninteresting calls
  NiceMock<MockConnection> nice_mock;
  // Delegate default connect call to basic implementation
  ON_CALL(nice_mock, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));

  // Code exercising the mock...
}
```


## 9. Troubleshooting

### Unexpected Call Errors
- Verify all expected calls are set before exercising code.
- Check that argument matchers align with actual calls.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` for call tracing.

### Warning about Uninteresting Calls
- Consider using `NiceMock` if warnings are too verbose.
- If calls are legitimately unexpected, add precise `EXPECT_CALL`s or `Times(0)` to disallow.

### Excessive Call Failures
- Check that call counts match specified cardinalities.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to deactivate expectations after use.

### Deadlocks with Complex Actions
- Avoid calling mock methods inside actions unless you ensure proper synchronization.
