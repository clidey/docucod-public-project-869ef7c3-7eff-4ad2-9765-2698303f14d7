# Best Practices for Mocking and Expectations

This guide empowers you to write clear, maintainable, and effective mocks with GoogleMock. It helps you decide when and how to use mock wrappers like `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and `NaggyMock`, craft expectations with actions, matchers, and cardinalities, and develop tests resilient to change while verifying meaningful interactions.

---

## 1. Choosing the Right Mock Wrapper: NiceMock, StrictMock, or NaggyMock

### What Are Mock Wrappers?
GoogleMock provides three primary wrappers to control how your mocks react to calls that have no explicit expectations (called *uninteresting calls*):

- **NiceMock<T>**: Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls. Useful when you want cleaner test output without noise from calls that you don't care about.
- **NaggyMock<T>** (default): Prints warnings on uninteresting calls, helping you notice unexpected interactions.
- **StrictMock<T>**: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures, enforcing strict interaction contracts.

### When to Use Each Wrapper

- **Use `NiceMock`** when your test only cares about a few specific interactions but allows other calls silently. This leads to cleaner and more maintainable tests with fewer false alarms.

- **Use `NaggyMock`** while developing or debugging tests when you want GoogleMock to notify you about any unanticipated mock method calls so you can decide if they are intentional.

- **Use `StrictMock`** only when you want to guarantee that every call to the mock is explicitly expected. Overusing strict mocks can make tests brittle and hard to maintain.

### Practical Guidance
- Currently, mocks behave as `NaggyMock` by default. The GoogleMock team plans to switch this to `NiceMock` for better maintainability.
- You can make a mock object "nice" or "strict" easily by declaring it as `NiceMock<MockClass>` or `StrictMock<MockClass>`. They subclass your mock class and inherit its constructors, so you can pass any constructor arguments transparently.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;
// Construct a nice mock that calls MockFoo(int, const char*).
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo(5, "hello");

// Construct a strict mock that calls MockFoo().
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;
```

### Caveats
- Wrappers only affect mock methods defined directly in the mock class using `MOCK_METHOD`. Inherited mock methods or nested wrappers are not supported.
- The destructor of the mocked class should be virtual for correct behavior.

<Warning>
Avoid mixing multiple wrappers on the same mock class (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockFoo>>`), as nested wrappers are unsupported.
</Warning>

## 2. Writing Expectations with Clarity and Precision

Effective and maintainable tests depend on well-specified expectations. Follow these guidelines:

### 2.1 Use `EXPECT_CALL` to Specify Must-Happen Calls
`EXPECT_CALL` sets expectations on your mock methods about how, when, and with what arguments they are called.


- Limit expectations to what matters to the test intent. Over-specification leads to brittle tests.
- Avoid setting expectations on every method in the mock—use `ON_CALL` or let them be uninteresting if you don’t care about them.

### 2.2 Use Matchers Effectively

Matchers specify how to match call arguments:

- Use simple matchers like `_` (wildcard) when argument values are irrelevant.
- Use specific matchers (`Eq()`, `Ge()`, `NotNull()`, `Contains()`, etc.) when the argument must meet certain criteria.
- Combine matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, or custom predicates as needed.

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SendData(Ge(0), _));  // Expects first arg >= 0, any second
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Log(StrEq("error"), _));  // Exact match on first arg
```

### 2.3 Cardinalities: Control How Many Times Methods Are Called

Specify how many times you expect a method to be called with `Times()`:

- Use `Times(Exactly(n))` or `Times(n)` for precise call counts.
- Use `Times(AnyNumber())` for methods that can be called multiple or zero times.
- Use `Times(AtLeast(n))` or `Times(AtMost(n))` for fuzzy cardinalities.

GoogleMock infers cardinality if you omit `Times()`:
- If you use `WillOnce()` *n* times and no `WillRepeatedly()`, cardinality is `Times(n)`.
- If you use `WillRepeatedly()`, cardinality is `Times(AtLeast(n))`.

### Pitfall to Avoid
```cpp
int n = 0;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).WillRepeatedly(Return(n++));  // Wrong: n++ evaluated once
```
Here `n++` is evaluated once when setting expectation, not on each call. Instead, use lambdas:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).WillRepeatedly([&n]() { return n++; });
```

### 2.4 Ordering Expectations

By default, call expectations can be matched in any order.

To enforce call order:

- Use the `InSequence` object to define a strict order within its scope.
- Use the `.After()` clause to specify that an expectation must be matched after other expectations.
- Use multiple `Sequence` objects and `.InSequence()` for partial orders.

Example:
```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, A()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, B()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, C()).InSequence(s2);
```

The above implies call order: A before B, and A before C; B and C order undefined.

### 2.5 Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to Retire Expectations
Without it, expectations in a sequence remain active after their call count is reached, often causing conflicts. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for higher maintainability when the expectation can expire after being met.

---

## 3. Setting Default Behavior with `ON_CALL`

Many mock methods don’t require explicit expectations every time they are called. Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors:

- `ON_CALL(mock, Method(args)).WillByDefault(action);` sets the default action executed whenever the method is called without an explicit matching `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Does not set an expectation; does not fail if uncalled.

Example:
```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, GetData(_))
    .WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

Use `ON_CALL` for routine behavior shared by many tests, and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you want to verify.

---

## 4. Using Actions to Customize Mock Behavior

Actions determine what happens when a mock method is called.

### Common Action Types
- `Return(value)` — returns a value.
- `ReturnRef(variable)` — returns a reference.
- `Invoke(func)` — calls a real function or a lambda.
- `DoAll(action1, action2, ...)` — performs multiple actions sequentially.
- `SetArgPointee<N>(value)` — sets the value pointed to by the N-th argument.

### Best Practices
- Use lambdas or `Invoke()` when your action logic is complex or when you want to return fresh objects on each call.
- Chain actions with `DoAll()` when you need to combine side effects and returns.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Transform(_))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<0>(100), Return(true)));
```

## 5. Tips for Maintainable and Robust Tests

### 5.1 Avoid Overspecification

Only expect what matters explicitly. Avoid requiring parameters or call orders that your system under test should not depend on.

### 5.2 Use Sequences Wisely

Order calls when the correctness depends on it. Avoid strict ordering for unrelated calls.

### 5.3 Namespaces and `using` Declarations

To improve readability, declare frequently used GoogleTest symbols once per file:
```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;
```

### 5.4 Verify Mocks Explicitly if Needed

Mocks automatically verify expectations on destruction. For heap-allocated mocks or delayed verification, use:
```cpp
Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);
```

### 5.5 Handle Uninteresting Calls Appropriately

- Use `NiceMock` to ignore uninteresting calls.
- Use `NaggyMock` to warn about them.
- Use `StrictMock` to fail on uninteresting calls.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-|-|
| Uninteresting call warnings clutter output | Use `NiceMock` or add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` for that method.
| Too many or too few `WillOnce` actions for expected call count | Ensure the number of `WillOnce` matches or is less than calls expected; use `WillRepeatedly` for infinite calls.
| Unexpected call despite `ON_CALL` set | `ON_CALL` does not set expectations; add `EXPECT_CALL` if call must be verified.
| Test fails due to order violations | Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses to specify expected order.
| Compiler issues with mock methods taking types with commas | Wrap complex types in extra parentheses or use type aliases in mocks.

---

## 7. Summary

Adopt the right mock wrapper for your test objectives: `NiceMock` for quiet toleration, `NaggyMock` for warnings while developing, and `StrictMock` for strict enforcement. Use `EXPECT_CALL` to express explicit behaviors and `ON_CALL` for defaults. Specify matchers and cardinalities thoughtfully to balance test strictness and flexibility. Define ordering when relevant, and use `.RetiresOnSaturation` for managing sticky expectations.

A well-crafted mock defines test contracts clearly, leading to maintainable, robust test suites that highlight real behavioral contracts and reduce maintenance pain.
