# Mocking Patterns & Best Practices

## Workflow Overview

This guide empowers you to master advanced mocking patterns in GoogleMock, focusing on strictness controls such as `NiceMock` and `StrictMock`. It teaches you how to write maintainable tests by minimizing brittleness, managing expectation lifecycles, and designing clear mocking strategies for long-term success.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with writing mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Understanding of `EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL`, and common mocking concepts (refer to [Introduction to Mocking](../mocking-techniques/introduction-to-mocking)).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Apply `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control mock strictness effectively.
- Use expectation sequencing, `RetiresOnSaturation`, and ordering to reduce test fragility.
- Design mocks that balance verification detail with test maintainability.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20-30 minutes to read and practice the patterns described.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand Mock Strictness Levels

GoogleMock offers three strictness wrappers for mocks to control how uninteresting calls (calls without explicit `EXPECT_CALL`) are handled:

- **NiceMock<T>**: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls. Use this when you want less noisy tests and to ignore calls that don’t matter for a given test.
  ```cpp
  NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, ImportantMethod());
  // Calls to other methods produce no warnings.
  ```

- **NaggyMock<T>**: Prints warnings on uninteresting calls (default behavior). Useful during test development for visibility.

- **StrictMock<T>**: Treats all uninteresting calls as errors, failing the test if any method without expectation is called. Use when you want to enforce very tight controls.

**Best Practice:** Prefer `NiceMock` to reduce test brittleness and use `StrictMock` selectively when behavior verification has to be exact.

### 2. Define Expectations with Care to Minimize Brittleness

- Start with general expectations that allow any arguments or multiple calls:
  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_))
      .Times(AnyNumber());
  ```
- Add specific expectations later to override more general ones:
  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(42))
      .Times(2);
  ```

This layering leverages GoogleMock’s reverse-order search, enabling flexible mock behavior.

### 3. Use `RetiresOnSaturation` to Manage Expectation Lifetime

Expectations in GoogleMock are "sticky" by default — they remain active even after their expected number of calls have occurred, potentially causing over-saturation errors if the same call is made again.

Apply `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations that should stop matching once saturated.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar())
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

This pattern prevents tests from failing on extra calls once the expectation has been met.

### 4. Use Sequence and `InSequence` for Ordering Constraints

When the order of calls matters, put expectations into a `Sequence` or use `InSequence` objects:

```cpp
Sequence s;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall()).InSequence(s);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall()).InSequence(s);
```

Or the simpler variant:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

This restricts the calls to occur strictly in the specified order.

### 5. Combine `After` and `InSequence` to Express Partial Orderings

You can precisely express dependencies between mock calls with `.After()` clauses:

```cpp
Expectation e1 = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Use()).After(e1);
```

Use `.After()` when the call order is not strictly linear or when you need partial ordering involving multiple mocks.

### 6. Avoid Over-Specification

- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior without forcing expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` **only** when verifying that a particular call MUST happen.
- Don’t add `EXPECT_CALL` for every possible call just to suppress warnings; prefer `NiceMock` instead.

### 7. Leverage Helpful Patterns

- **Delegation to Fakes:** Write a fake implementation (non-mocking but functional) and delegate your mock's default behavior to it using `ON_CALL`.
- **Retiring Expectations in Loops:** When expecting sequences of calls, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` in a loop or use sequences to avoid sticky expectations blocking later calls.

### 8. Verify and Clear Expectations Explicitly When Needed

Call `::testing::Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object)` to force verification before destruction—for example, when the mock is owned by production code and its destructor timing is uncertain.

### 9. Use `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_object)` to Suppress Leak Reports When Necessary

If you must leak a mock (for example, because of long-lived global mocks), explicitly annotate it so GoogleMock will not report it as a failure.

## Examples & Code Samples

### Example: Using StrictMock to Enforce Call Precision

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StrictMock;
using ::testing::_;

class MockPrinter {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Print, (const std::string& s), ());
};

TEST(PrinterTest, NoUninterestingCallsAllowed) {
  StrictMock<MockPrinter> mock_printer;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_printer, Print("Hello World"));

  mock_printer.Print("Hello World");  // OK
  mock_printer.Print("Oops");         // Fails test (unexpected call)
}
```

### Example: Using `RetiresOnSaturation` to Allow Exact Call Counts

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, ProcessData(_))
    .Times(3)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();

// The ProcessData method can be called exactly 3 times and the expectation
// retires after these occur, allowing for other expectations afterward.
```

### Example: Partial Call Ordering with `After`

```cpp
Expectation init = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process()).After(init);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Finish()).After(init);

// The calls to Process() and Finish() must occur after Init(), but they
// can occur in any order relative to each other.
```

### Example: Layering General and Specific Expectations

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SendMessage(_))
    .Times(::testing::AnyNumber());  // General catch-all.
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SendMessage("Important"))
    .Times(2);                      // Specific, overriding the catch-all.
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Unexpected Calls on Non-Expected Methods:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings or explicitly add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.
- **Sticky Expectations Leading to Over-Saturation Errors:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or sequences to retire expectations after use.
- **Test Failures Because of Ordering Mistakes:** Check if you need explicit sequences or `.After()` clauses to enforce call order.
- **Leaked Mocks Causing Test Fail Failures:** Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` on mocks intentionally not destroyed.

### Best Practices

- Prefer `ON_CALL` for setting behaviors when call verification is not required.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly and specifically to keep tests robust and maintainable.
- Document expectations clearly and name tests to describe what behavior is being verified.
- Avoid placing multiple expectations on the same mock method without clear ordering.

### Performance Considerations

- Large numbers of expectations or complex sequences can slow down test execution.
- Consider simplifying mocks by delegating to fakes or reducing strictness where possible.

### Alternative Approaches

- Use `NiceMock` for day-to-day test maintenance to keep tests clean.
- Use `StrictMock` when verifying critical workflow correctness.
- Use partial mocking or delegation to fakes to balance test coverage and complexity.

<Tip>
Consistency in mock strictness and expectation management significantly reduces test brittleness and maintenance overhead. Start with `NiceMock` and add stricter verification only when necessary.
</Tip>

<Note>
Remember: `EXPECT_CALL` expectations take precedence in reverse order of declaration. Ordering your expectations from general to specific is key.
