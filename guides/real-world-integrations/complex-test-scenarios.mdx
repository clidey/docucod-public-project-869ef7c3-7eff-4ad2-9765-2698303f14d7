# Testing Edge Cases and Complex Behaviors

This guide helps you advance your GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage by simulating edge cases and complex behaviors in your tests. Learn how to create death tests, integrate custom test runners, handle platform-specific behavior, and push your testing boundaries with clear, real-world examples.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Task Description:** Learn techniques to design and run tests that cover challenging or unusual scenarios, such as unexpected crashes, custom test runners, and platform-specific behaviors.
- **Prerequisites:**
  - Basic familiarity with GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage
  - A working test project with GoogleTest integrated
  - Familiarity with writing and running standard tests
- **Expected Outcome:** You will be able to write tests that cover non-trivial edge cases and complex behavior patterns effectively, increasing your project's test coverage and robustness.
- **Time Estimate:** 30–90 minutes, depending on your familiarity and the complexity you implement.
- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced

## Simulating Death Tests

Death tests let you verify that your code terminates or crashes under defined conditions, ensuring safe error handling in severe failure scenarios.

### Step 1: Understand When to Use Death Tests

Use death tests when you need to confirm that your code:

- Fails safely in the presence of fatal errors
- Asserts or crashes as expected on invalid input
- Terminates under specified error conditions

### Step 2: Write a Basic Death Test

Use the `ASSERT_DEATH` or `EXPECT_DEATH` macros to wrap the code expected to crash or abort.

```cpp
TEST(MyClassDeathTest, CrashesOnInvalidInput) {
  MyClass obj;
  ASSERT_DEATH(obj.DoDangerousOperation("bad_input"), "Invalid input");
}
```

- The second argument is a regex matching the error message or output on death.

### Step 3: Customize Death Test Behavior

- Use `ASSERT_EXIT` if you want more control over the exit code, signal, or output.
- Write separate death tests in a distinct `*_death_test.cc` file for clarity.

### Practical Tips

- Avoid death tests in multi-threaded contexts to minimize race conditions.
- Keep death tests focused and isolated for easier debugging.
- Use `--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe` on supported platforms for better stability.

## Integrating Custom Test Runners

Some projects require extending GoogleTest's default test runner behavior, for example, to add custom setup, filtering, or reporting.

### Step 1: Understand the Default Runner

GoogleTest runs tests via `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` after initialization with `InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()`. This main function can be customized.

### Step 2: Write Your Custom Runner

Create your own main function or test runner, controlling test execution flow:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  // Custom setup code here.
  
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  
  // Custom teardown or reporting
  return result;
}
```

### Step 3: Add Platform-Specific or Project-Specific Logic

- Perform environment checks before running tests.
- Log or collect additional statistics.
- Modify test filtering or arguments programmatically.

### Practical Tips

- Keep the core runner logic: call `InitGoogleTest()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Avoid duplicating GoogleTest internal logic.
- Consult the [Integration with Other Tools & Systems](https://your-docs/overview/architecture-features-integration/integration-overview) guide for advanced build and CI integrations.

## Handling Platform-Specific Test Behavior

GoogleTest supports multiple platforms. Sometimes tests need to behave differently on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

### Step 1: Use Preprocessor Macros

Wrap platform-dependent code in preprocessor conditions:

```cpp
#if defined(_WIN32)
  // Windows-specific setup
#elif defined(__linux__)
  // Linux-specific setup
#else
  // Other platforms
#endif
```

### Step 2: Use GoogleTest Platform Macros

GoogleTest defines [platform-specific macros](https://google.github.io/googletest/api/gtest-port_8h_source.html) such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, which can also be used.

### Step 3: Conditional Skipping of Tests

Use `GTEST_SKIP()` or `return` early to skip tests on unsupported platforms:

```cpp
TEST(SomeFeatureTest, WorksOnlyOnLinux) {
#if !defined(__linux__)
  GTEST_SKIP() << "Test runs only on Linux.";
#endif
  // Test code here
}
```

### Practical Tips

- Use platform conditionals sparingly to keep tests portable.
- Document any skipped tests clearly.
- Check platform support in [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](https://your-docs/getting-started/prerequisites-and-installation/system-requirements).

## Pushing Your Tests Beyond the Basics

### Writing Complex Call Sequences

Use `InSequence` and `Sequence` objects to enforce call order across mocks:

```cpp
Sequence seq;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, FirstCall()).InSequence(seq);
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SecondCall()).InSequence(seq);
```

### Retiring Expectations

Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations inactive after being satisfied. This allows overlapping expectations to coexist.

### Partial Orders with `.After()`

Create precise control over order dependencies:

```cpp
Expectation e1 = EXPECT_CALL(mock1, DoA());
EXPECT_CALL(mock2, DoB()).After(e1);
```

### Using Default Actions

Define default behavior for methods that have no explicit `EXPECT_CALL`:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_obj, Method(_)).WillByDefault(Return(true));
```

Useful when setting broad behavior without verifying every call.

### Working with Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

- **NiceMock** suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock** (default) warns on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock** treats uninteresting calls as errors.

Example:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockClass> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockClass> strict_mock;
```

Use them to tune verbosity and strictness to your testing needs.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Death Test Failures

- Ensure the death test runs in a suitable environment.
- Use `--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe` to stabilize multi-threaded deaths.

### Unexpected Mock Calls

- Check if expectations cover all possible method calls.
- Add catch-all expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())` and `_` matcher to suppress unwanted warnings.

### Compilation Issues

- Use type aliases to handle complex method signatures with commas in `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Be cautious with Microsoft Visual C++ warnings related to `const` parameters; remove the top-level const modifier in parameters to avoid compiler bugs.

### Performance

- Split large mock classes' constructors/destructors out of headers to speed up compilation.

## Example: Death Test with Verbose Output

```cpp
// Verifies that the program aborts when pointer is null
TEST(FooDeathTest, NullPointerCausesAbort) {
  Foo foo;
  EXPECT_DEATH(foo.Process(nullptr), "pointer must not be null");
}
```

Run with verbose logging:

```bash
./foo_test --gtest_filter=FooDeathTest.* --gmock_verbose=info --gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe
```


## Example: Using Nice and Strict Mocks

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

class MockWidget {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoWork, (), ());
};

TEST(WidgetTest, NiceMockSuppressesWarnings) {
  NiceMock<MockWidget> widget;
  widget.DoWork();  // No warning if expectations missing.
}

TEST(WidgetTest, StrictMockFailsOnUnexpectedCall) {
  StrictMock<MockWidget> widget;
  EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(widget.DoWork(), "Uninteresting mock function call");
}
```


## Example: Custom Test Runner

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);

  // Custom setup code here
  
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();

  // Custom teardown or reporting

  return result;
}
```

</Tip>

<Note>
If you experience warning messages regarding uninteresting calls, consider using `NiceMock` to suppress them, or explicitly specify expectations with `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to indicate allowed calls.
</Note>

<Warning>
Death tests may be flaky on some platforms or certain test environments. Use `--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe` and isolate death tests to improve stability.
</Warning>
