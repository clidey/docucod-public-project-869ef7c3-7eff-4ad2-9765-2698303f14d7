# Effective Assertions and Matchers

## Overview
This page offers practical guidance on using GoogleTest and GoogleMock assertions and matchers effectively to write robust, readable, and maintainable tests. It covers built-in assertions, how to choose between fatal and non-fatal checks, combining matchers for precise argument verification, and authoring custom matchers to tailor validations to your domain. Additionally, it explains advanced matcher features and how to improve test diagnostics for easier debugging.

---

## What You Will Achieve
- Confident use of GoogleTest assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `EXPECT_*`) and GoogleMock matchers.
- Understanding when to use fatal vs. non-fatal assertions to optimize test flow.
- Skillfully combine matchers to express complex argument expectations.
- Create custom matchers to capture domain-specific properties.
- Write clearer tests with improved failure diagnostics.

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup.
- Familiarity with writing simple tests and mocks.
- GoogleMock included by adding `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions: Fatal vs. Non-Fatal

GoogleTest offers two main categories of assertions:

- **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: On failure, aborts the current test immediately.
- **Non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: On failure, records the failure but continues executing the test.

### Best Practices
- Use `ASSERT_*` when subsequent test steps depend on the success of the assertion (e.g., checking if a pointer is non-null before dereferencing).
- Use `EXPECT_*` when you want to verify multiple conditions independently and continue testing regardless of individual failures.

### Example
```cpp
TEST(MyTest, FatalVsNonFatal) {
  int* p = nullptr;
  ASSERT_NE(p, nullptr);  // Test aborts here because p is null.
  *p = 5;  // Safe only if previous ASSERT passes.
}

TEST(MyTest, MultipleNonFatalChecks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);  // Test continues even if this fails
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
  // All EXPECT_* failures reported at test end.
}
```

---

## 2. Basic Use of Built-in Assertions and Matchers

GoogleTest assertions check test conditions directly, while GoogleMock matchers validate function call arguments.

### Common Assertions
- `ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual)` / `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)` — equality
- `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` / `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` — boolean truth
- `ASSERT_NE` / `EXPECT_NE` — inequality
- `EXPECT_THROW(stmt, exception_type)` — exception checking

### Matchers
Matchers are predicates that verify arguments passed into mock function calls.
Use them inside `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL`.

- Wildcard matcher: `_` matches anything.
- Equality matcher: `Eq(value)` matches exact value.
- Relational matchers: `Gt(val)`, `Ge(val)`, `Lt(val)`, `Le(val)`.
- Boolean matchers: `IsTrue()`, `IsFalse()`.

### Example
```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Eq;
using ::testing::Gt;

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(Eq(5), Gt(10)));  // Arg1 == 5, Arg2 > 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(_, _));           // Any arguments
```

---

## 3. Combining Matchers for Complex Conditions

To express conditions on an argument involving multiple criteria, use combined matchers:

- `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)`: All matchers must succeed.
- `AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)`: Any matcher may succeed.
- `Not(m)`: Negates matcher `m`.

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(AllOf(Gt(5), Ne(10))));  // Arg > 5 and not 10
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Baz(AnyOf(Eq(1), Eq(2), Eq(3))));  // Arg is 1, 2, or 3
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Qux(Not(Eq(0))));  // Arg is not 0
```

### Practical Tip
Combine matchers to reduce brittle tests that depend on one exact value, enabling the test to tolerate a range or set of acceptable inputs.

---

## 4. Using Matchers to Validate Complex Arguments

Matchers can be used not only for primitive types but also for:

### Members of Objects
- `Field(&Class::member, matcher)`: Matches an object whose member matches.
- `Property(&Class::getter, matcher)`: Matches an object whose getter method returns a value matching the matcher.

### Pointee Values
- `Pointee(matcher)`: Matches a pointer pointing to a value matching the matcher. Automatically fails on `nullptr`.

### Containers
- `ElementsAre(...)`: Matches container elements in order.
- `UnorderedElementsAre(...)`: Matches container elements in any order.

### Examples
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Func(Field(&MyStruct::id, Eq(123))));
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Func(Property(&MyClass::GetName, HasSubstr("test"))));
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Func(Pointee(Gt(10))));
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Func(ElementsAre(1, 2, 3)));
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Func(UnorderedElementsAre(3, 1, 2)));
```

---

## 5. Defining Custom Matchers

Sometimes you need predicates not covered by built-in matchers. Custom matchers allow you to encode domain-specific conditions with clear failure messages.

### Quick Definition Using `MATCHER` Macro
```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "is an even number") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(IsEven()));
```

### Custom Matcher Class
For complex conditions or widely reusable matchers, define a matcher class:
```cpp
class BarPlusBazEqMatcher {
 public:
  using is_gtest_matcher = void;

  explicit BarPlusBazEqMatcher(int expected_sum) : expected_sum_(expected_sum) {}

  bool MatchAndExplain(const Foo& foo, std::ostream* os) const {
    const int val = foo.bar() + foo.baz();
    if (val != expected_sum_) {
      if (os) *os << "sum was " << val;
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }

  void DescribeTo(std::ostream* os) const {
    *os << "bar() + baz() equals " << expected_sum_;
  }

  void DescribeNegationTo(std::ostream* os) const {
    *os << "bar() + baz() does not equal " << expected_sum_;
  }

 private:
  int expected_sum_;
};

::testing::Matcher<const Foo&> BarPlusBazEq(int expected_sum) {
  return ::testing::MakeMatcher(new BarPlusBazEqMatcher(expected_sum));
}
```

### Tips
- Custom matchers must be pure functions without side effects.
- Use the `result_listener` or stream output in `MatchAndExplain()` to give failure details.

---

## 6. Improving Test Diagnostics

Clear failure messages accelerate debugging:

- Use expressive matchers that describe intent (e.g., `HasSubstr`, `Contains`, `Field`).
- Combine matchers with meaningful names.
- Customize matcher descriptions for better output.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` for rich assertion messages.

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(container, ElementsAre(Ge(5), Ne(10), _));
```

If this fails, the failure message shows which element did not meet the condition.

---

## 7. Advanced Matcher Features

### Matching Multiple Arguments as a Unit
Use `.With()` clause in `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` to add a multi-argument matcher:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(obj, Func(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // First argument is less than second
```

- `With()` applies to all arguments as one tuple.

### Using Custom Predicates
Wrap a predicate function with `Truly()` to convert any unary predicate into a matcher:

```cpp
bool IsPrime(int n) { ... }
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(Truly(IsPrime)));
```

---

## 8. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Overly strict matchers:** Avoid matching every argument when only some matter.
- **Omitting `RetiresOnSaturation()` for sequential calls:** Without it, repeat calls may cause upper-bound violations.
- **Misordering expectations:** Remember last matching expectation wins.
- **Using side effects inside `.WillOnce(Return(n++))`:** The `Return` evaluates once; use lambdas instead.
- **Uninteresting calls warnings:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress or add permissive expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.

---

## 9. Example: Combining Multiple Concepts

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::_; 
using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Not;
using ::testing::NiceMock;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Process, (int x, const std::string& s), ());
};
MATCHER_P3(IsSpecial, min, max, substr, "") {
  return arg.first > min && arg.first < max && arg.second.find(substr) != std::string::npos;
}

TEST(FooTest, ComplexMatchers) {
  NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(AllOf(Gt(5), Not(10)), _))
      .Times(AtLeast(1))
      .WillRepeatedly([](int x, const std::string& s) { return true; });

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_, IsSpecial(1, 10, "abc")))
      .WillOnce([](int, const std::string&) { return false; });

  EXPECT_TRUE(mock.Process(7, "hello"));
  EXPECT_FALSE(mock.Process(5, "abcde"));
}
```

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Effective Assertions and Matchers">
<Accordion title="Uninteresting mock function call warnings">
If you see warnings about uninteresting calls, it means mock methods were called without expectations.
- Add a permissive expectation `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` to suppress warnings.
- Alternatively, use `NiceMock<MockClass>` to suppress warnings for all uninteresting calls on an object.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Upper bound violation errors">
If a mock method is called more times than expected:
- Check if you need `.RetiresOnSaturation()` in chained expectations.
- Verify the ordering and the number of `WillOnce` actions relative to `Times()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Matching overloaded methods">
Disambiguate overloaded methods with `Const()` or type-specific matchers like `TypedEq`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests fail due to too many or too few actions specified">
Check the number of `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()` clauses matches the cardinality set in `Times()`. The library warns when mismatched.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom matcher errors or poor diagnostics">
Ensure that custom matchers are pure and provide descriptive messages using streams or `EXPECT_` statements inside the matcher body.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
