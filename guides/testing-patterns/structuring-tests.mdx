# Structuring and Organizing Tests

## Overview

As your test suite grows beyond simple cases, maintaining clarity, reusability, and coverage becomes essential. This guide reveals the best practices for structuring and organizing tests using GoogleTest. You will learn how to group related tests logically, leverage test fixtures to share setup, and apply typed and parameterized tests for broad coverage with minimal duplication.

By following these guidelines, you ensure your tests remain readable, maintainable, and effective as your codebase evolves.

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Organize tests into meaningful test suites reflecting your code structure
- Use **test fixtures** to share setup and teardown code across multiple tests
- Group related test cases for scalable test organization
- Utilize **value-parameterized tests** to execute the same test logic over multiple input values
- Apply **typed tests** to run test patterns across multiple data types
- Adopt naming conventions that enhance discoverability and readability

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest concepts, including `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros
- GoogleTest installed and configured in your development environment
- A C++ codebase with functionality ready for test coverage

---

## 1. Organizing Tests Into Suites

### Principles

Tests should be grouped into **test suites** that logically reflect the structure of the code being tested. This helps both discovery and maintenance.

### How-to

- Use the `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro to define individual tests.
- Ensure all tests related to a class, module, or feature share the same `TestSuiteName`.
- Avoid underscores in test suite or test names for clarity and to comply with Google C++ style guidelines.

#### Example

```cpp
// Tests related to the Factorial function
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Tests in the same suite are automatically grouped, making results and reports easier to interpret.

## 2. Using Test Fixtures to Share Setup and Teardown

### Why Use Test Fixtures?

When multiple tests need to work with the same data setup or configuration, writing repetitive code becomes costly and error-prone. Test fixtures let you define shared objects and setup routines once and use them in multiple tests.

### Creating a Test Fixture

1. Define a fixture class deriving from `testing::Test`.
2. Declare member variables for resources shared across tests.
3. Override `SetUp()` to initialize your resources before each test.
4. Override `TearDown()` to clean up after each test.

### Running Tests with Fixtures

Use `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` to write tests that use the fixture.

#### Example

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare queues for testing
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  auto* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Best Practices

- Use `SetUp()` instead of constructors for initialization to allow using GoogleTest assertion macros if needed.
- Do not make changes to shared fixture data in tests that can affect others (each test uses a fresh fixture object).
- If expensive resources can be shared across tests in a suite, consider `static` members with `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` (see Advanced Topics).

---

## 3. Naming Conventions

Consistent, clear names improve test readability and help tools filter and report test results more effectively.

### Guidelines

- Use `CamelCase` for test suite and test names.
- Avoid underscores `_` in test suite and test names; prefer concatenations or camel case per Google C++ style.
- Name a test suite after the class or module it covers.
- Give each test a descriptive name indicating the behavior or condition being tested.

#### Examples

```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, InsertIncreasesSize);
TEST(MatrixTest, ThrowsOnInvalidDimensions);
```

---

## 4. Value-Parameterized Tests for Input Combinations

When you want to verify that your code behaves correctly over a range of inputs, value-parameterized tests let you write the test code once and run it with multiple input values.

### How to Define

1. Define a fixture class derived from `testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
2. Use the `TEST_P()` macro to create your parameterized test, accessing input with `GetParam()`.
3. Instantiate instances with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` supplying input value generators.

#### Example

```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers,
                         IsEvenTest,
                         testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

### Tips

- Use `testing::Range()`, `testing::Values()`, or `testing::ValuesIn()` to generate test parameters.
- For complex tests, consider using `Combine()` to generate tuples of input parameters.

<p><i>Note:</i> By default, parameterized tests require at least one instantiation; if none is instantiated, a test failure will result unless marked otherwise.</p>

## 5. Typed Tests to Test Multiple Types

Typed tests extend the concept of parameterized tests to run the *same test logic* on different types without duplicating code.

### Steps to Use Typed Tests

1. Define a fixture class template inheriting from `testing::Test`.
2. Create a list of types using `testing::Types<T...>`.
3. Bind the types to the fixture with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.
4. Write tests using `TYPED_TEST()` accessing the type as `TypeParam`.

#### Example

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MathTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_ = T();
};

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MathTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MathTest, IsZeroInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, TypeParam{});
}
```

### Advantages

- Ensures consistent behavior across multiple data types.
- Reduces boilerplate and potential mistakes from copying test code.

## 6. Grouping and Scaling Your Test Suites

When your project grows:

- Organize tests in source files following your project structure.
- Use namespaces or nested test suites where appropriate.
- Separate slow or integration tests from fast unit tests, using naming or filtering conventions.

Use command-line flags like `--gtest_filter` to control test execution.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Common Pitfall**: Mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` without defining the fixture causes compilation errors. Always define the fixture class before using `TEST_F()`.
- **Fixture Independence**: Each test gets a fresh fixture object; tests must not depend on side effects across tests.
- **Test Suites**: Tests in different suites can share test names but should be logically grouped.
- **Parameter Naming**: Ensure instantiations have unique names to avoid ambiguity in test output.
- **Avoid Overusing Parameterized Tests**: Use them judiciously to keep tests understandable.

<Tip>
Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context in complex test helpers or nested calls to clarify test failure locations.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

After organizing your tests efficiently:

- Explore running tests conditionally using filters (`--gtest_filter`).
- Discover advanced fixture setups with shared resources via `SetUpTestSuite()`.
- Learn about test event listeners to customize test reporting.
- Review guides on [Effective Assertions and Matchers](../testing-patterns/effective-assertions.md) to write meaningful checks.

## Example

A brief example combining the concepts:

```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator_.Reset();
  }

  Calculator calculator_;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator_.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

class IsPrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsPrimeTest, HandlesPrimesCorrectly) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PrimeTests, IsPrimeTest, testing::Values(2, 3, 5, 7, 11));

template <typename T>
class NumericLimitsTest : public ::testing::Test {};

using NumericTypes = testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericLimitsTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericLimitsTest, MaxIsGreaterThanZero) {
  EXPECT_GT(std::numeric_limits<TypeParam>::max(), 0);
}
```

This scales from simple fixtures to parameterized and typed tests for full test coverage.
