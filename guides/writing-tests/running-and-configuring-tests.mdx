# Running and Configuring Test Suites

GoogleTest offers powerful options for running tests with customized configurations. This guide walks you through practical methods to run tests selectively, control their order, enable parallel execution, and customize outputs—all via command-line flags. Understanding these options lets you efficiently manage test execution workflows tailored to your development needs.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Task Description**: Learn how to run GoogleTest test suites with various configurations, including filtering specific tests, setting execution order, running tests concurrently, and adjusting output verbosity and format.
- **Prerequisites**: A compiled test executable containing GoogleTest tests, and a command-line environment for running tests.
- **Expected Outcome**: Ability to execute tests flexibly to accelerate debugging, integration, and continuous testing with meaningful reports.
- **Time Estimate**: 10-20 minutes to familiarize and apply filtering, ordering, and output customization.
- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner to intermediate.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Running All Tests by Default

Simply run your test binary without any arguments:

```bash
./my_test_executable
```

This runs all registered tests discovered in the executable.

#### Expected Result
All test suites and tests execute sequentially, with detailed output on pass/failure status.

---

### 2. Filtering Tests to Run Specific Subsets

When your test suite is large, run a targeted subset using the `--gtest_filter` flag.

- **Syntax:**
  ```
  --gtest_filter=PositivePattern[-NegativePattern]
  ```
- **PositivePattern:** globs specifying which tests to include.
- **NegativePattern:** (optional) globs specifying tests to exclude.

**Example:**

To run all tests in `FactorialTest` except those named `HandlesZeroInput`:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*-*.HandlesZeroInput
```

**Tips:**
- Use `*` wildcard for partial matches.
- Separate multiple patterns by colon `:`.

#### Expected Result
Only tests matching the filter run.

---

### 3. Controlling Test Execution Order

By default, GoogleTest runs tests in the order of their registration, which usually follows source file ordering.

- **Shuffle Tests:** Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order.

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_shuffle
```

- **Repeat Tests:** Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times (helpful for detecting flaky tests).

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_repeat=10
```

- **Seed for Shuffle:** Control shuffling repeatability with `--gtest_random_seed=N`.

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_shuffle --gtest_random_seed=12345
```

#### Expected Result
Tests run in randomized order, with optional repeats to increase test robustness.

---

### 4. Running Tests in Parallel

GoogleTest itself doesn’t provide built-in parallel runtime.

However, external test runners, build systems (like Bazel, CTest, or CI servers), or custom scripts can run multiple processes of the test executable in parallel with appropriately divided filters.

**Recommendation:**
Structure tests to be independent and side-effect free to enable safe parallel execution.

---

### 5. Customizing Output Format

GoogleTest supports multiple output formats to integrate results with different tools.

- **Default Output:** Human-readable text on the console.

- **XML Output:** Useful for CI systems.

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_output=xml[:path]
```

If no path is specified, it defaults to `test_detail.xml` in the current directory.

- **JSON Output:** (Available in recent versions)

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_output=json[:path]
```

- **Combining Output and Filtering:**

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=MySuite.* --gtest_output=xml:results.xml
```

#### Tips:
- Use XML output for integrating with Jenkins, TeamCity, or other CI tools.
- JSON output can be parsed for custom dashboards or reporting.

---

### 6. Verbosity and Silent Modes

Modify verbosity to suit your needs:

- `--gtest_brief` reduces output to summaries per test suite.
- `--gtest_print_time=0` disables time output.

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_brief --gtest_print_time=0
```

---

### 7. Listing Available Tests Without Running

To see all tests registered in your executable, run:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_list_tests
```

This prints all test suites and tests available, helping you build filters or verify test registration.

---

## Practical Example

Suppose you have a large test executable and want to:

- Run all tests in the `FactorialTest` suite except those with `HandlesZeroInput`.
- Run tests three times.
- Output results in XML format.
- Shuffle tests with a fixed seed.

You would run:

```bash
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*-*.HandlesZeroInput --gtest_repeat=3 --gtest_output=xml --gtest_shuffle --gtest_random_seed=42
```

Verify the XML report at `test_detail.xml` for result summaries.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running When Filtered">
Make sure your filter syntax is correct. Remember to separate positive and negative patterns with a hyphen `-`. Use `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm test names.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output XML File Not Generated">
Verify write permissions in the target directory. Confirm the `--gtest_output` flag is properly formatted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Seem to Run Twice or More">
Check if `--gtest_repeat` is set unintentionally or if your test runner calls the executable multiple times.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Fail Non-Deterministically in Shuffle Mode">
Ensure test independence. Flaky tests often indicate hidden dependencies or shared mutable state.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_help` to get a full list of test execution flags available.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Combine filtering with your build system or CI pipeline to run only relevant test subsets on code changes, reducing feedback time.
