# Organizing and Grouping Your Tests

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to structure tests for larger C++ projects using **GoogleTest**. By adopting clear organization strategies such as test suites, test fixtures, and consistent naming conventions, you will improve your test discoverability, maintainability, and clarity, especially as your codebase grows and test coverage expands.

Whether you are new to GoogleTest or upgrading existing tests, learning these practices will help you write scalable and robust testing code.

---

## Why Organize Tests?

Imagine working on a project with hundreds or thousands of tests. Without a meaningful structure, understanding what gets tested, tracking failures, or extending tests becomes a challenge. Organizing tests helps you:

- **Scale your test codebase** without chaos.
- **Find and run related tests** easily.
- **Share fixtures and setup/teardown logic** to reduce duplication.
- **Express intent clearly** through naming conventions.

By grouping related tests, GoogleTest can also report results grouped by logical components, which aids in quicker diagnosis and targeted test execution.

---

## Key Concepts for Organizing Tests

### 1. Test Suites (Test Cases)

A **test suite** is a named group of related test cases. It typically correlates to a class, module, or feature in your codebase.

- Use the first argument of the `TEST()` macro to specify the test suite.
- Tests within the same suite share a common theme.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, IsEmptyInitially) { ... }
TEST(VectorTest, PushBackIncreasesSize) { ... }
```
Both tests belong to the `VectorTest` suite.

---

### 2. Test Fixtures

When multiple tests need the same setup or reusable environment (e.g., initialized data or common helpers), use a **test fixture**.

A test fixture is a class derived from `testing::Test`:

- Declare shared objects or setup logic in the fixture.
- Use `TEST_F()` instead of `TEST()` to write tests that use the fixture.

Example:
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> queue_;  // Shared among tests

  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(10);
    queue_.Enqueue(20);
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, SizeIsTwoAfterSetup) {
  EXPECT_EQ(queue_.size(), 2);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsFirstElement) {
  int* elem = queue_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(elem, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*elem, 10);
  delete elem;
}
```

The fixture creates a fresh state for each test.

---

### 3. Naming Conventions

Adopt clear and consistent naming conventions for your test suites, fixtures, and test cases to:

- Convey what is tested.
- Avoid ambiguity and collisions.
- Help tools and humans navigate tests easily.

#### Recommendations:

- Use **CamelCase** or **PascalCase** for suite and fixture names matching C++ class names.
- Test case names should be concise but descriptive, indicating the tested behavior or condition.
- Avoid underscores (`_`) in suite and test names, as GoogleTest requires valid C++ identifiers without underscores.

Example:
```cpp
TEST_F(StringUtilTest, ConvertsToUpperCaseCorrectly) { ... }
```

---

### 4. Logical Grouping and Granularity

Group tests based on:

- Feature areas or components.
- Class or module under test.
- Test type (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).

Avoid overly large test suites that test unrelated features. Instead, create multiple suites or fixtures.

Each test should focus on a **single behavior or case**.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow to Organize a Test Suite

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the Test Suite">
Choose a meaningful suite name that reflects the class or module under test.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, PushBackIncreasesSize) { ... }
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create Test Fixtures for Shared Setup">
Define a fixture class if multiple tests share the same setup or helpers.
Use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for initialization and cleanup.

Example:
```cpp
class StackTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Stack<int> stack;
  void SetUp() override {
    stack.Push(1);
    stack.Push(2);
  }
};
```
</Step>
<Step title="Write Tests With Clear Names Using TEST_F">
Write tests inside the fixture with `TEST_F()`, each testing a specific behavior.
Use assertions (`EXPECT_*`, `ASSERT_*`) to verify expected outcomes.

Example:
```cpp
TEST_F(StackTest, SizeReflectsNumberOfPushes) {
  EXPECT_EQ(stack.Size(), 2);
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Apply Consistent Naming Conventions">
Apply naming standards to suite, fixture, and test case names to keep the codebase uniform.
</Step>
<Step title="Refactor and Extract Additional Fixtures If Needed">
If a test suite grows too large or has complex setups for subsets of tests, consider splitting it into multiple fixtures.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Isolate tests:** Each test gets a fresh fixture instance. Avoid relying on mutable static or global state.
- **Minimal setup:** Only put in the fixture what _all_ tests in the suite need.
- **Re-use fixtures strategically:** Avoid duplication by grouping related tests sharing the same environment.
- **Name tests around behavior:** Test names like `ReturnsEmptyVectorWhenNoElements` describe **what** is tested, not **how**.
- **Keep tests short:** Focus on a single aspect or scenario per test for clarity and maintainability.
- **Run tests by suites:** Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to run relevant suites or tests.

Example command:
```
./my_tests --gtest_filter=VectorTest.*
```

- **Use nested tests only if needed:** GoogleTest does not support nested test suites natively. Use composition through fixtures or source folders to organize.

## Troubleshooting Common Organization Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems When Organizing Tests">
<Accordion title="Tests Order Dependency">
Tests should not depend on previous tests' side effects.

If tests fail when run all together but pass individually, make sure they do not share mutable global state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Naming Collisions">
Avoid duplicate suite or test names as they cause compilation errors or tests silently ignored.

Choose unique, descriptive names.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Fixture Misuse">
Check that `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` are correctly spelled (capital `U`) and declared as `override` if overriding.

Mis-spelling leads to silent failures in setup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Overly Broad Test Suites">
Huge suites with many unrelated tests are hard to maintain.

Split suites logically to keep tests relevant and focused.

## Appendix: Example

Here's a brief example illustrating organization:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "my_vector.h"  // The class under test

// Fixture for tests on MyVector<int>
class MyVectorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  MyVector<int> vec;

  void SetUp() override {
    // Start with a vector holding {1, 2, 3}
    vec.PushBack(1);
    vec.PushBack(2);
    vec.PushBack(3);
  }
};

TEST_F(MyVectorTest, SizeAfterSetupIsCorrect) {
  EXPECT_EQ(vec.Size(), 3);
}

TEST_F(MyVectorTest, PushBackAddsElement) {
  vec.PushBack(4);
  EXPECT_EQ(vec.Size(), 4);
  EXPECT_EQ(vec.At(3), 4);
}

TEST_F(MyVectorTest, ClearRemovesAllElements) {
  vec.Clear();
  EXPECT_EQ(vec.Size(), 0);
}

// A separate test suite for tests not needing setup
TEST(MyVectorSimpleTest, EmptyVectorHasZeroSize) {
  MyVector<int> empty_vec;
  EXPECT_EQ(empty_vec.Size(), 0);
}
```

This layout allows grouping all related tests that use the `MyVectorTest` fixture together, while allowing simple tests without setup to be placed elsewhere.

<Tip>
Well-organized tests are easier to read, maintain, run selectively, and debug. As your project grows, invest in good organization upfront for long-term productivity.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleTest supports running individual tests or suites selectively using the `--gtest_filter` flag, leveraging your organization.
</Note>

<Warning>
Be mindful that over-specifying test expectations or tight coupling tests to implementation details may decrease maintainability.
</Warning>
