# Integrating GoogleTest with CI/CD

## Overview

This guide walks you through integrating GoogleTest with Continuous Integration (CI) and automated build environments on Linux, macOS, and Windows. You will learn how to run GoogleTest suites reliably in automated pipelines, interpret exit codes, and avoid common pitfalls related to test execution and reporting.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you set up your GoogleTest-based test suite to run within CI/CD systems, ensuring that test runs are reliable, fast, and integrated with build automation workflows.

### Prerequisites
- A working GoogleTest test suite built and runnable on your development machine.
- Familiarity with basic command-line usage for your test executable.
- Access to your CI environment (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

### Expected Outcome
- Your tests will run automatically during CI builds
- Proper reporting of successes and failures via exit codes
- Appropriate use of command line options for selective or parallel test execution
- Reduced flaky failures related to environment or test setup

### Time Estimate
Setup typically takes 15-30 minutes depending on your CI platform and project.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate â€” assumes familiarity with CI basics and C++ testing

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Build Your GoogleTest Executable in CI

1. Clone your project repository in the CI environment.
2. Configure your build system (e.g., CMake) to include and compile GoogleTest.
3. Build the test executable in your CI build script.
4. Verify that the binary is generated and accessible.

_Expected result_: The test executable is present in your build directory.

### Step 2: Initialize GoogleTest in Your Test Binary

Ensure your test executable calls `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` in its `main()`.
This step prepares the test runner for handling flags and running tests.

_Expected result_: Calls to `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` will execute all registered tests.

### Step 3: Run Tests Via CI Script

Invoke your test executable in your CI job with no arguments for default behavior:
```sh
./your_test_binary
```

Check that:
- Tests run and print output to console
- Exit code is 0 on success, or 1 on failure

### Step 4: Use Flags To Control Test Execution

You can pass GoogleTest flags to fine-tune test runs:

- `--gtest_filter`: Run a specific subset of tests by name
- `--gtest_repeat=N`: Repeat all tests N times for flakiness detection
- `--gtest_shuffle`: Randomize test order
- `--gtest_break_on_failure`: Halt on first failure (useful during debugging)
- `--gtest_output=xml:filename.xml`: Generate XML reports for CI systems

Example to run only tests in `FooTest`:
```sh
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=FooTest.*
```

_Expected result_: Only the filtered tests are executed.

### Step 5: Generate JUnit-Style XML Reports

Most CI servers can parse XML reports produced by GoogleTest:
```sh
./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

Upload the resulting `report.xml` file from your CI workspace to your CI test results dashboard.

_Expected result_: XML file contains detailed pass/fail test information for your CI system.

### Step 6: Check Exit Codes for CI Success/Failure

GoogleTest uses the exit code of your test binary to signal test status:
- Exit code `0`: All tests succeeded
- Exit code `1`: One or more tests failed or crashed

Ensure your CI system marks the build failed if the test step returns a non-zero exit code.

### Step 7: Handle Disabled Tests

Disabled tests are not run by default. To include them in your CI runs:
```sh
./your_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

Use this option cautiously; disabled tests are often under development or known to be flaky.

### Step 8: Integrate Parallel and Sharded Test Runs (Optional)

For large test suites, you can distribute tests across parallel agents using GoogleTest's sharding:

Configure environment variables:
- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=<total_shard_count>`
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=<current_shard_index>`

Run the same test executable on each shard.

Example for shard 0 of 2:
```sh
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=2
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./your_test_binary
```

_Expected result_: Each shard runs a unique subset of tests.

## 3. Examples & Script Samples

### Example: Minimal CI Job Script (Linux / macOS)
```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Build
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Run all tests
./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:results.xml

# Exit code controls success/failure of CI step
exit $?
```

### Example: Running Selected Test Suite
```sh
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyFeatureTest.*
```

### Example: Parallel Shards in CI
```sh
# For shard 1 of 3
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./your_test_binary
```

### Example: Fail Fast During Debugging
```sh
./your_test_binary --gtest_fail_fast
```

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Test binary does not exit with non-zero on failure** 
  - Ensure your `main()` correctly returns `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- **Tests run but no output seen**
  - Some CI consoles buffer output. Run with `--gtest_print_time` or add logging.

- **Flaky tests in random order**
  - Use `--gtest_repeat=N` and `--gtest_shuffle` in CI to detect and diagnose flakes.

- **Slow test suite**
  - Use test suite level fixture `SetUpTestSuite()` to share expensive setup.
  - Run tests in parallel shards if possible.

- **Disabled tests unexpectedly excluded**
  - Use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` to include them.

### Best Practices

- Always return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.
- Generate XML reports for easy CI integration and historical tracking.
- Use test filters to speed up early debugging.
- Leverage sharding or parallel test execution if your CI supports it.
- Regularly monitor and fix disabled tests.
