# Debugging and Troubleshooting Test Failures

This guide equips you with systematic strategies and practical tools for diagnosing and resolving failed or flaky tests when using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. By understanding test output, leveraging logging and verbosity options, and interpreting framework messages, you will efficiently identify root causes and improve test reliability.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Failure Output

### What a Failure Report Reveals
When a GoogleTest test fails, the framework reports the exact assertion or expectation that failed, including:

- The expression evaluated and its actual value
- The expected condition
- Source file and line number of the failure
- Stack traces if verbosity settings enable them

Example output for a failed `EXPECT_EQ`:

```shell
Expected equality of these values:
  actual
  expected
    Which is: 5

...<file_path>:42: Failure
Value of: actual
  Actual: 4
Expected: expected
```

This information is your first clue to isolate the failure cause.

### Diagnosing Failure Causes
Failures may result from:
- Incorrect test logic
- Defects in the code under test
- Misconfigured mocks or expectations
- Inappropriate input or environment setup

Start by verifying the exact assertion that failed and confirming whether the test or the implementation is at fault.

---

## 2. Leveraging GoogleMock’s Verbose Logging for Insight

### The `--gmock_verbose` Flag
GoogleMock offers dynamic verbosity levels to control output detail during test execution. Adjust this flag to tailor diagnostic information.

- `info` — Logs all mock calls with detailed information including matched expectations and stack traces.
- `warning` — Logs warnings for uninteresting calls and errors. This is the default.
- `error` — Only logs errors (no warnings or info messages).

**Usage:**

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This produces detailed call traces, showing which `EXPECT_CALL` an invocation matched or why a call was considered unexpected.

### Example of Detailed Verbose Logging

Running a test with `--gmock_verbose=info`: a mock function call matching an expectation might print:

```
Mock function call matches EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5))...
    Function call: Foo(5)
Stack trace:
 ...
```

This helps you confirm the correct expectation is triggered, and reveals unexpected calls or mismatched arguments.

### When to Use

- Use during test development to verify mock call behavior
- Use when a test fails unexpectedly and you need call-level diagnostics
- Temporarily increase verbosity in CI job logs for flaky or intermittent failures

---

## 3. Interpreting Uninteresting and Unexpected Calls

### Definitions
- **Uninteresting calls**: Calls to mock methods without any matching `EXPECT_CALL`; by default, gMock warns but allows the call.
- **Unexpected calls**: Calls that have matching `EXPECT_CALL`s but don't satisfy any matcher conditions; these are treated as errors.

### Common Causes and Fixes

| Symptom                                  | Cause                                | Fix                                             |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Warning: "Uninteresting mock function call" | No `EXPECT_CALL` set for a called mock method | Add an appropriate `EXPECT_CALL` or use `NiceMock` if calls should be ignored |
| Error: "Unexpected mock function call" | Call arguments do not match any expectation | Review or add expectations matching the call arguments |

### Using NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock

- `NiceMock<T>`: suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls
- `NaggyMock<T>`: warns on uninteresting calls (default behavior)
- `StrictMock<T>`: treats uninteresting calls as failures

Choose the right mock type depending on your test’s strictness requirements.

---

## 4. Diagnosing Failing Expectations

### Common Patterns

- **Too few calls:** Expectation expects at least `n` calls, but fewer occurred.
- **Too many calls:** Expectation called more than the max specified.
- **Argument mismatch:** The actual arguments do not satisfy the matchers.

### Example - Missing Calls

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5)).Times(2);
mock.Foo(5);
// Fails because Foo(5) was called only once instead of twice.
```

The output describes the expectation and how many times it was actually called.

### Example - Argument Mismatch

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(10)));
mock.Foo(5);
// Fails because 5 is less than 10.
```

The failure output will display the expected matcher and actual arguments.

### Inspecting Order Constraints

If you use `InSequence` or `After` clauses, order violations cause failures.
Locate tests with these clauses and verify calls occur in expected sequence.

---

## 5. Using Stack Traces for Debugging

When verbosity is set to `info` or if enabled by default in debug builds, GoogleMock prints stack traces at the point of mock calls.

These traces help:
- Identify where the mock call originates
- Verify expectations were set at the right place
- Determine unexpected or uninteresting calls source

**Note:** Stack traces may be suppressed in release or quiet verbosity modes.

---

## 6. Setting and Clearing Expectations

### Verifying Expectations Explicitly

Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` to force verification and clear all expectations on a mock.

- Returns `true` if all expectations were met
- Can be called multiple times
- Avoid setting new expectations after calling it to prevent undefined behavior

Example:

```cpp
MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).Times(1);
mock.Foo();
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
```

### Clearing Default Actions

`Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock)` clears expectations and default actions, allowing fresh setup.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Flaky Tests

### Causes
- Race conditions or timing issues in multi-threaded tests
- Dependencies on shared state or environment
- Unstable mock behavior or incorrect expectations

### Strategies
- Isolate test code to single-threaded context if possible
- Use synchronization primitives like `Notification` for async testing
- Apply sequences and ordering constraints to enforce call order
- Use verbose logging to trace call interleaving

---

## 8. Additional Practical Tips

- Use `EXPECT_CALL(...).WillRepeatedly(...)` for frequent default behavior
- Use wildcard matchers `_` to loosen argument matching when appropriate
- For verbose failures, use `--gtest_stack_trace_depth` to control stack trace detail
- Suppress uninteresting call warnings via `NiceMock` or explicit `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())`
- For unexpected call diagnostics, run tests under `--gmock_verbose=info` to see matching attempts and detailed explanations

## 9. Summary and Next Steps

By understanding how to read test failure reports, configure verbosity, and use GoogleMock’s diagnostic features, you can systematically debug and address test failures. To deepen your knowledge, explore:

- [Advanced Mocking Patterns](/guides/essential-workflows/advanced-mocking-patterns)
- [Using GoogleMock Flags and Verbosity Settings](docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md#Flags)

For live troubleshooting, remember the value of running tests with:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=info --gtest_stack_trace_depth=5
```

and making use of explicit expectation verification and mock type settings (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) to tailor test feedback.

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Failure Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Uninteresting Calls Warning">
Uninteresting calls are calls to mock methods without any expectations. GoogleMock warns about them by default to help catch forgotten expectations.

**Fix:** If these calls are expected and should be ignored, consider using `NiceMock` or add an explicit `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to silence warnings.

**Example:**
```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> foo;
// No EXPECT_CALL needed for uninteresting calls
foo.Bar(5);
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Calls Failure">
An unexpected call occurs when a mock function is called with arguments that don't match any active expectation.

**Symptoms:** Test failure message indicating "Unexpected mock function call" and the arguments it was called with.

**Fix:** Ensure that expectations cover all legitimate argument cases or adjust argument matchers.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(10)));
mock.Foo(5);  // Fails
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Too Few or Too Many Calls">
If calling `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(n)` or related cardinalities, failure messages indicate calls fewer or more than expected.

**Fix:** Confirm the code under test calls the mock method the expected number of times, or relax cardinality constraints.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).Times(2);
mock.Foo();  // Fails on exit as only 1 call made
```
</Accordion>
