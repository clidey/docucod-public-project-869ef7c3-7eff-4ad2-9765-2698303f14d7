# Project Integration & Best Practices

This guide provides clear, actionable strategies to integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively into your C++ projects. Focused on directory structuring, dependency management, custom test runners, and CI/CD pipeline setup, it ensures consistent test execution and maintainability across diverse project environments.

---

## 1. Integration Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your existing or new C++ projects to streamline testing practices, enabling organized codebases, reliable dependency handling, and smooth automation in CI/CD pipelines.

### Prerequisites
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries downloaded or included in your project (via CMake, Bazel, or other build systems).
- Your C++ project configured for external dependencies.
- Basic familiarity with writing GoogleTest-based tests and mocks.
- Access to your project's CI/CD environment for automation setup.

### Expected Outcome
- Clean, scalable test directory structure.
- Seamless dependency management and linking.
- Customizable test runners for flexible execution.
- Automated test execution integrated within CI/CD pipelines.

### Time Estimate
Depends on project complexity but typically between 1-3 hours for medium-sized projects.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate â€” requires understanding of build systems and testing workflows.

## 2. Step-by-Step Integration Instructions

### Step 1: Organize Your Test Directory Structure

1. Create a dedicated directory for tests, e.g., `/tests` or `/test`.
2. Mirror the source directory hierarchy under `/tests` to maintain clarity.
3. Place GoogleTest and GoogleMock include and source files in a separate vendor or third-party folder, e.g., `/third_party/googletest`.

**Expected Result:** A clear folder layout that logically separates production code, test code, and external dependencies.

---

### Step 2: Manage Dependencies via Your Build System

#### Using CMake (recommended):

1. Add GoogleTest and GoogleMock as submodules or external projects inside `/third_party` or download via `FetchContent`.
2. Include `gtest` and `gmock` targets in your CMakeLists:

```cmake
# Fetch GoogleTest
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

# Define test executable
add_executable(my_tests
    tests/my_test.cc
    ...
)

# Link with gtest and gmock
target_link_libraries(my_tests PRIVATE gtest_main gmock)

# Enable testing and add test
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

3. Ensure C++17 standard is set (GoogleTest requires at least C++17).

#### Using Bazel:

1. Configure `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD` files to add `googletest` dependency.
2. Define test targets linking `@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main`.

**Expected Result:** Build system correctly integrates GoogleTest and GoogleMock as dependencies, allowing compilation and linking without errors.

---

### Step 3: Customize Your Test Runner

1. If you need to extend test runner behavior (e.g., setup, teardown, filtering), write a custom `main()`.

2. Use `::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` to initialize the framework.
3. Call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and return its result.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  // Insert any pre-test setup here
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  // Insert any post-test cleanup
  return result;
}
```

4. Alternatively, link with `gtest_main` to avoid writing a main function.

**Expected Result:** Your tests can be run with custom setup logic when needed, or default runner otherwise.

---

### Step 4: Integrate Tests Into Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

1. Include commands to build and run your tests in your CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).

2. Example for a shell-based CI step:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make my_tests
./my_tests --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

3. Configure your CI server to:
   - Fail the build if tests fail.
   - Collect and archive test reports.
   - Optionally run tests in parallel to speed up execution.

4. For coverage reporting, integrate coverage tools together with tests.

**Expected Result:** Automated test runs for every build or pull request, ensuring quality gates.

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example: CMakeLists.txt Basic Integration

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
  GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests
  tests/example_test.cc
)

target_link_libraries(my_tests PRIVATE gtest_main gmock)

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME ExampleTest COMMAND my_tests)
```

### Example: Custom Test Runner `main()`

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  // Setup code here
  int rc = RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  // Cleanup code here
  return rc;
}
```

## 4. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup title="Common Integration Issues & Tips">

<Accordion title="Linker Errors with gtest or gmock Libraries">
Make sure your build system links with both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries and that library paths are correctly set.

- Verify the linkage commands.
- Confirm the C++ standard version is set to C++17 or newer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Not Discovered">
- Check that tests are registered correctly using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Confirm that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called.
- Ensure the test executable does not exit prematurely.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow Compilation Times">
- Move mock class constructor/destructor implementations to `.cc` files to avoid redundant compilation.
- Only mock necessary interfaces and avoid mocking concrete classes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CI/CD Runs Not Failing on Test Failures">
- Use the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` as the exit code.
- Ensure your CI step checks the process exit code.
- Output XML or JSON reports for CI consumption.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

**Best Practices:**

- Keep test files close to the code they test for easier navigation.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` judiciously to balance verbosity and strictness.
- Explicitly specify `Expectations` only when verifying interactions.
- Write clear, maintainable test names and structure tests into suites.
- Periodically validate your testing environment with sample tests.
