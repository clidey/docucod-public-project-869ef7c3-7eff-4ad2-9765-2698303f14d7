# Effective Mocking: Patterns and Pitfalls

This guide explores advanced mocking strategies in GoogleMock (gMock) including partial and strict mocks, the use of `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` classes, sequencing, handling uninteresting calls, common anti-patterns, and how to create robust, maintainable tests.

---

## 1. Understanding Mock Strictness Classes

GoogleMock provides special mock wrappers that affect how mocks react to *uninteresting calls* (calls to mock methods without explicit expectations). Selecting the right one improves test clarity and maintainability.

### The Three Main Strictness Wrappers:

| Wrapper              | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls                                      | Usage Recommendation                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock<T>`        | Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls. Allows more relaxed tests. | Use for most tests to reduce noise and brittle failures.           |
| `NaggyMock<T>`       | Default behavior; warns on uninteresting calls.                      | Useful when debugging or developing new tests to catch unexpected method calls.
|
| `StrictMock<T>`      | Treats all uninteresting calls as test failures.                     | Use sparingly only when you want to enforce strict verification. Ideal for critical paths.
|

#### Usage Examples:
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;
// Typical test with NiceMock to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, DoThis());
...

// Strict enforcement that only expected calls happen
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(strict_mock_foo, DoThis());
...
```

<Note>
`NiceMock<T>` and `StrictMock<T>` only affect mock methods declared directly in `T` using `MOCK_METHOD`. Methods inherited from base classes may not be affected due to C++ limitations.
</Note>

## 2. Partial and Hybrid Mocking

### Partial Mocks

Partial mocks combine real implementations with mock overrides. Use cases include:

- Testing parts of a complex class by mocking selected virtual methods.
- Delegating calls to real implementations when appropriate.

You create partial mocks by inheriting from the real class and mocking some methods while optionally delegating calls to the real implementation:

```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual int Compute(int x);
  virtual int Helper(int y);
};

class PartialMockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  // Mock only one method...
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int x), (override));

  // Delegate Helper calls to real Foo::Helper()
  int Helper(int y) override { return Foo::Helper(y); }
};
```

TIP: Delegating ensures realistic behavior in tests and reduces duplication. See [Delegating Calls to a Real Object](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#DelegatingCallsToRealObject).

---

## 3. Sequencing Expectations

Tests often require certain calls to happen in order. GoogleMock offers two main sequencing approaches:

### 3.1 Using `InSequence` Scope

Wrap expectations inside an `InSequence` object to enforce a strict call order:

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence seq;  // All EXPECT_CALLs inside scope ordered

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, A());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, B());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, C());
}
```

Here, `A()` must be called before `B()`, which must be called before `C()`.

### 3.2 Partial Ordering with `Sequence` Objects

For complex partial orders (DAGs), use `Sequence` objects and assign expectations to them:

```cpp
using ::testing::Sequence;
Sequence s1, s2;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, A()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, B()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, C()).InSequence(s2);
```

This means `A()` must happen before both `B()` and `C()`, but the relative order of `B()` and `C()` doesn't matter.

TIP: Combine with `After()` clauses for flexible DAGs. Refer to [Partial Order](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#PartialOrder).

## 4. Managing Uninteresting Calls

- **Uninteresting call:** A mock method is called without any explicit expectation.
- By default (NaggyMock), gMock warns about uninteresting calls.
- Using `NiceMock` suppresses these warnings.
- Using `StrictMock` treats them as fatal errors.

### Dealing with Uninteresting Calls:

- **Do nothing** if you do not care about a method's calls.
- Use **`ON_CALL`** to specify default behavior.
- Suppress warnings explicitly with `NiceMock`.
- To explicitly accept all calls, use expectations like:
  ```cpp
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
  ```

---

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 5.1 Overly Restrictive Expectations

Setting expectations on every method call and argument makes tests brittle and hard to maintain.

**Best Practice:** Only expect calls you need to verify. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors.

### 5.2 Overusing `StrictMock`

While strict mocks catch unplanned calls, they often produce failures during harmless refactors, increasing maintenance cost.

**Best Practice:** Prefer `NiceMock` in most tests, reserve `StrictMock` for critical scenarios.

### 5.3 Expecting Calls in Wrong Order Without Purpose

Specifying full call order when order doesn't matter leads to fragile tests.

**Best Practice:** Use partial ordering (`Sequence`, `After`) or no ordering unless order is integral to functionality.

### 5.4 Ignoring `ON_CALL`

Using only `EXPECT_CALL` without setting default `ON_CALL` behaviors leads to repetitive tests.

**Best Practice:** Set sensible default behaviors with `ON_CALL` and use `EXPECT_CALL` only for verification.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Effective Mocking

- **Use `ON_CALL` to configure default behaviors** rather than `EXPECT_CALL` unless you intend to verify the call happened.
- **Only verify one behavior per test** to keep tests simple and failure messages clear.
- Use **`NiceMock`** to suppress noise and focus on verified expectations.
- Utilize **sequences** only when call ordering impacts correctness.
- Prefer **partial mocks** to avoid duplicating real implementations or verbose setups.
- **Delegate to real or fake objects** when real behavior is complex but partially mockable.
- **Mark destructors virtual** in base classes to avoid subtle bugs when mocking.
- Set the **default return values** or actions for non-void methods as needed using `ON_CALL` or `DefaultValue<T>::Set()`.
- Leverage **matchers** for argument flexibility and fine-grained verification.
- Use **retire-on-saturation** to avoid sticky expectation awkwardness when expecting repeated calls.

<Tip>
Aim for tests that focus on client-visible behavior, avoiding over-coupling tests to implementation details.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                                 | Likely Cause                                   | Solution                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uninteresting call warnings             | Method called without `EXPECT_CALL` or quieting mock | Use `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress warning when acceptable |
| Test fails due to unexpected call       | Call made does not match any `EXPECT_CALL`     | Check argument matchers, add missing expectation, or adjust `EXPECT_CALL` |
| Test fails due to call order             | Strict sequence or `InSequence()` constraints not met | Relax order constraints or fix test logic to match expected call sequence |
| Returning move-only types fails          | Using `Return(std::move(...))` multiple times  | Use lambdas or `WillOnce()` with functors creating new instances each call |
| Mock destructor warnings or leaks       | Base class lacks virtual destructor             | Make base class destructor virtual to allow proper mock destruction |
| Compilation errors with `MOCK_METHOD` and commas | Commas in return or argument types interfering with macro | Wrap return/argument types in parentheses or use typedef aliases |

<Warning>
Avoid suppressing warnings by blindly adding `EXPECT_CALL()` without understanding; it leads to brittle, noisy tests.
</Warning>
