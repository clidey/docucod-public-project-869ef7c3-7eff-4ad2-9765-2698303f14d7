# Structuring Tests with Fixtures and Suites

## Overview

This guide helps you organize your C++ tests effectively by using **test fixtures** and **test suites** in GoogleTest. You will learn how to layer common setup and cleanup logic, reuse test data across multiple tests, and structure your test code to improve clarity and maintainability.

### What You Will Achieve
- Organize related tests into test suites.
- Share common setup and teardown logic using test fixtures.
- Reuse data and utility subroutines across tests.
- Write tests that are easier to read, maintain, and extend.

### Who Should Use This Guide
This guide is designed for C++ developers who want to write structured and maintainable tests with GoogleTest. It assumes basic familiarity with GoogleTest macros like `TEST()` and `EXPECT_*` assertions.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Fixtures and Suites

### What is a Test Suite?
A **test suite** is a grouping of related test cases. In GoogleTest, a test suite is identified by the first argument to the `TEST()` macro. Suites help logically organize tests and improve the readability of test output.

### What is a Test Fixture?
A **test fixture** is a class that contains common objects, data, and setup/cleanup code shared by multiple tests. It reduces code duplication and ensures consistency.

- Test fixtures are implemented as classes derived from `testing::Test`.
- You define setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) methods to prepare and clean up the shared environment.
- Tests within the fixture use `TEST_F()` macros to access fixture members.

### Why Use Fixtures?
- Avoid repeated code in each test.
- Maintain a consistent initial state for tests.
- Enable easier updates and maintenance by centralizing shared logic.

## 2. Creating a Test Fixture

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Define a Test Fixture Class">
Derive a new class from `testing::Test`. Make member variables and setup logic `protected:` or `public` so that tests can access them.

```cpp
class WidgetTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Widget widget_;

  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize widget before each test
    widget_.Initialize();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up if necessary
    widget_.Reset();
  }
};
```
</Step>

<Step title="Write Tests Using `TEST_F`">
Write tests that use the shared fixture by using `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)`. Access fixture members directly.

```cpp
TEST_F(WidgetTest, IsInitiallyEmpty) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(widget_.IsEmpty());
}

TEST_F(WidgetTest, CanAddItem) {
  widget_.AddItem("item");
  EXPECT_FALSE(widget_.IsEmpty());
}
```

Each test runs independently with a fresh fixture instance.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Expected Outcome
- Each test runs with the widget initialized freshly.
- Setup and teardown are called automatically before and after each test.

<Check>
You should see test output confirming multiple tests run independently with shared setup.
</Check>

## 3. Sharing Expensive Resources Across Tests

### Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`
For costly resources that do not need to be re-created per test, you can:

- Declare static members in your fixture to hold the shared resource.
- Define public static methods `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` in your fixture.
- GoogleTest calls these once per test suite before any tests run and after all tests finish.

### Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static Database* db_;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_ = new Database("test_connection_string");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete db_;
    db_ = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    db_->BeginTransaction();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db_->RollbackTransaction();
  }
};

Database* DatabaseTest::db_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryReturnsResults) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_->Query("SELECT * FROM users").HasRows());
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertAddsRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_->Execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES ('test')"));
}
```

### Benefits:
- The database connection is opened only once.
- Each test is isolated by starting and rolling back a transaction.

> Remember: Test order is undefined. Tests should not depend on sequence or side effects.

## 4. Organizing Tests for Clarity and Maintainability

### Best Practices
- **Name your test suites and fixtures clearly** to reflect the functionality they cover.
- Keep fixture classes focused; don’t overload with unrelated functionality.
- Use helper methods inside your fixture to encapsulate repetitive code.
- Avoid sharing mutable state between tests except via controlled static members.
- Prefer `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for per-test logic and `SetUpTestSuite()`/`TearDownTestSuite()` for shared setup.

### Example: Refactoring Repetitive Code

```cpp
class FileParserTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  FileParser parser_;

  void LoadSampleFile(const std::string& filename) {
    parser_.LoadFile(filename);
  }
};

TEST_F(FileParserTest, HandlesEmptyFile) {
  LoadSampleFile("empty.txt");
  EXPECT_TRUE(parser_.IsEmpty());
}

TEST_F(FileParserTest, ParsesCorrectly) {
  LoadSampleFile("sample.txt");
  EXPECT_EQ(3, parser_.RecordCount());
}
```

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Mixing TEST() and TEST_F() in the same test suite">

GoogleTest requires that all tests in the same test suite use the same fixture class. Mixing `TEST()` (no fixture) and `TEST_F()` (fixture) with the same test suite name causes runtime errors.

**Tip:** Use different test suite names or consistently use fixtures.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Not defining default constructors for fixture classes">

Fixture classes must have a default constructor so GoogleTest can instantiate them.

**Tip:** If your fixture has non-default constructors, explicitly define a default one.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Spelling `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` correctly">

`SetUp()` and `TearDown()` are case-sensitive. Misspelling them (e.g., `Setup()`) means they won’t be called.

**Tip:** Use `override` keyword to catch mistakes at compile time:

```cpp
void SetUp() override {
  ...
}
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Avoiding shared state issues between tests">

Tests should be independent. If shared static resources are mutable, ensure they are reset between tests.

**Tip:** Use proper setup and teardown methods to reset state.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Advanced Structuring Techniques

### Using Inheritance to Share Fixtures
You can derive fixtures from a base fixture to share common logic and extend specialized tests:

```cpp
class BaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void CommonSetup() { /*...*/ }
};

class DerivedTestA : public BaseTest {
  void SetUp() override {
    BaseTest::SetUp();
    // Additional setup
  }
};

TEST_F(DerivedTestA, Test1) { ... }
```

### Parameterized Tests
For cases where tests run with multiple inputs, you may want to use [value-parameterized tests](../guides/common-workflows/value-type-param-tests.md) to structure tests efficiently (see next steps).

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Verifying Setup/TearDown Execution
Add logging inside `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, `SetUpTestSuite()`, and `TearDownTestSuite()` to confirm they execute as expected.

### Use Scoped Traces
Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add context to failures inside fixtures or helper methods.

```cpp
void Helper(int n) {
  SCOPED_TRACE(testing::PrintToString(n));
  EXPECT_GT(n, 0);
}
```

### Cleanup in Case of Early Failures
Ensure fixture teardown code can run safely even if setup fails or if a fatal assertion aborts the test.

### Keep Fixtures Focused
Avoid putting unrelated utility functions or multiple responsibilities in one fixture class.
