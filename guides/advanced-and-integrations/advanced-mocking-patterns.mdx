# Advanced Mocking Patterns and Strategies

Explore advanced techniques and patterns in GoogleMock that empower you to write expressive, maintainable, and accurate mock-based tests. This guide covers custom matchers and actions, managing invocation sequences and cardinalities, and controlling mock strictness to tailor mock behavior precisely to your testing needs.

---

## 1. Enhancing Mocking Precision with Custom Matchers

Match function arguments beyond built-in matchers to express nuanced constraints that reflect your domain logic.

### Writing Custom Matchers

- Use the `MATCHER` and `MATCHER_P` macros for simple, reusable matchers.
- For complex cases, define matcher classes implementing `MatchAndExplain()`, `DescribeTo()`, and `DescribeNegationTo()`.

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "Checks if a number is even") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

// Usage
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsEven()));
```

### Combining Matchers

- Combine matchers with logical operators like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` to form complex predicates.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(AllOf(Ge(5), Lt(10))));
```

### Best Practices

- Keep matchers pure functions with no side effects to ensure predictable behavior.
- Provide informative failure messages in `MatchAndExplain()` for easier debugging.

---

## 2. Crafting Custom Actions to Simulate Behaviors

Actions define what a mocked method does when invoked. Customize them to simulate your component’s operational behavior.

### Built-in Actions Overview

- `Return(value)`, `ReturnRef(variable)`: Return values or references.
- `SetArgPointee<N>(value)`: Assign to output parameters.
- `Invoke(function)`: Call existing functions, methods, or lambdas.
- `DoAll(...)`: Combine multiple actions executing in order.

### Defining Your Own Actions

- Use C++ lambdas or functor objects with compatible signatures as actions:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(_))
    .WillOnce([](int x) { return x * 2; });
```

- For reusable custom behaviors, define classes implementing `operator()` compatible with the mock method signature.

### Delegating Calls

- Delegate mock calls to a real or fake implementation to preserve behavior while verifying interactions.

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (override));

  int real_get_value() { return real_->GetValue(); }
  MockFoo() { ON_CALL(*this, GetValue).WillByDefault([this](){ return real_get_value(); }); }

 private:
  Foo real_;
};
```

---

## 3. Managing Call Order and Sequences

Control the expected order and partial order of mock method invocations to enforce complex interaction protocols.

### Sequential Expectations

- Use the `InSequence` RAII object to declare a block where calls must occur in order.

```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar());
}
```

### Partial Ordering with Sequences

- Use named `Sequence` objects and assign multiple expectations to control partial ordering via `.InSequence()`.

```cpp
Sequence seq1, seq2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init()).InSequence(seq1, seq2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process()).InSequence(seq1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Finish()).InSequence(seq2);
```

### After Clause

- Use `.After()` to specify that certain calls happen only after others.

```cpp
Expectation init = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Initialize());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process()).After(init);
```

## 4. Leveraging Cardinalities for Flexible Invocation Expectations

Specify how many times methods are expected to be called, including ranges and custom constraints.

### Built-in Cardinalities

| Cardinality      | Meaning                                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Exactly(n)`     | Expected exactly `n` times                  |
| `AtLeast(n)`     | Expected at least `n` times                  |
| `AtMost(n)`      | Expected at most `n` times                   |
| `Between(m, n)`  | Expected between `m` and `n` times inclusive |
| `AnyNumber()`    | Expected any number of times                  |

### Retiring Expectations

- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire an expectation after hitting the upper bound to allow other expectations to match afterwards.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

### Defining Custom Cardinalities

- Implement the `CardinalityInterface` to create domain-specific cardinality logic.

## 5. Controlling Mock Strictness and Uninteresting Calls

Fine-tune how GoogleMock treats calls that aren’t explicitly expected.

### Types of Mock Strictness

| Mock Wrapper         | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock<T>`       | Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls     |
| `NaggyMock<T>`      | The default; warns on uninteresting calls      |
| `StrictMock<T>`     | Treats uninteresting calls as failures         |

### Choosing the Right Strictness

- Use **nice mocks** to reduce test noise when uninteresting calls are expected.
- Use **strict mocks** to catch unwanted interactions.
- Avoid overusing strictness to prevent brittle tests.

### Suppressing Warnings for Specific Methods

- Use `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to explicitly expect any calls to a method and suppress warnings.

### Managing Expectation Lifetime

- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if a mock object lifetime is not well-controlled, to force verification explicitly.

---

## 6. Tips and Common Patterns

- **Ordering of Expectations:** Newer expectations override older ones; always order `EXPECT_CALL` statements thoughtfully.
- **Mocking Overloaded Methods:** Mock all overloads or `using` base method(s) as needed to avoid hiding base methods.
- **Using `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`:** Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior that doesn’t constrain call count, reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for behavior verification.
- **Testing Asynchronous Code:** Use actions combined with synchronization primitives (e.g., `Notification`) to make asynchronous tests deterministic.
- **Mocking Move-Only Types:** Support exists via `MOCK_METHOD`; use lambdas to generate unique return objects on repeated calls.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Advanced Mocking

### Common Issues

- **Uninteresting call warnings:** Confirm whether calls should occur or set proper expectations.
- **Over-saturated call errors:** Check that `Times()` and `WillOnce()` clauses align with actual call counts.
- **Hidden base methods:** Use `using Base::MethodName;` in your mocks.
- **Compilation slowdowns:** Move mock class constructor and destructor definitions to `.cc` files.

### Proactive Best Practices

- Avoid mocking concrete classes directly; prefer coding to interfaces with mocks.
- Use delegation patterns to combine mocks with real or fake implementations.
- Regularly verify expectations and clear defaults to avoid stale mocks.
