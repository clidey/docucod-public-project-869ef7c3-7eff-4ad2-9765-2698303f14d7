# CI/CD and Project Integration

Mastering seamless integration of GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your C++ projects and CI/CD pipelines is key for scalable, maintainable, and efficient testing. This guide provides best practices for organizing your codebase, modularizing tests, handling continuous integration workflows, and maintaining reliable automated testing processes.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This page guides you through integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock into larger codebases and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It helps you establish robust testing flows, gain faster feedback cycles, and organize your tests for maintainability.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage.
- A C++ project with an existing build system (e.g., CMake, Bazel).
- Access to or knowledge of your project's CI/CD system.

### Expected Outcome
- Properly modularized test suites using GoogleTest.
- Integration of testing into your build and deployment pipelines.
- Configured automated test execution with clear reporting.
- Reduced test flakiness with environment and setup best practices.

### Time Estimate
Initial integration: 1–2 hours (varies by project complexity).

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to advanced, focusing on project architecture and automation.

## 1. Organizing Your Codebase for Test Integration

Organize your source and test code in a way that enables smooth integration:

### a. Separate Production and Test Code
Keep production and test code in distinct directories or Bazel targets. For example:

- `src/` for production code.
- `tests/` or `src/tests/` for unit and integration tests.

This prevents accidental dependencies and makes it easier to control test builds.

### b. Modularize Test Targets
Break your tests into logical groups (unit, integration, mocks) with their own build targets. This enables:

- Running specific subsets of tests during development.
- Parallel execution in CI systems.

### c. Organize Mock Classes
Avoid defining mock classes inside individual test files when interfacing with external dependencies. Instead, place mocks:

- Near the interface they mock (e.g., `foo/testing/mock_foo.h`) if you own the interface.
- In shared test utility libraries if mocks need reuse across multiple test suites.

This reduces duplication and eases maintenance.

<Tip>
When mocking third-party or externally owned interfaces, prefer creating adaptor interfaces and mocks for those adaptors rather than mocking externally controlled classes directly.
</Tip>

## 2. Configuring Your Build System

Follow these best practices for integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock into your build system:

### a. Use Official Integration Options
- For CMake: Use either standalone builds, embedding GoogleTest as a subdirectory, or dynamic fetching via `FetchContent`.
- For Bazel: Use the official GoogleTest Bazel rules provided in your workspace.

Make sure:

- Test targets link against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Include directories for headers are correctly set.

### b. Enable Parallel Test Execution
Configure your build and test runner to execute tests in parallel to reduce overall test time (e.g., `ctest -jN` or Bazel's parallel test execution).

### c. Manage Test Dependencies
Minimize dependencies for each test target to improve build and test performance. Avoid cross-linking too many modules if not necessary.

<Tip>
Validate your build configuration using the provided "Validating Your Installation" guide to confirm that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are correctly linked.
</Tip>

## 3. Integrating Tests in CI/CD Pipelines

### a. Automate Test Discovery and Execution
Configure your CI jobs to build and run tests automatically:

- Use standard test runners supported by GoogleTest (e.g., the test binary executable).
- Run tests with XML output enabled (`--gtest_output=xml:report.xml`) to integrate results into CI dashboards.

### b. Monitor Test Failures and Flakiness
Set up alerts and dashboards to track test failures over time, and identify flaky tests. Flaky tests reduce confidence in CI and increase cycle times.

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_shuffle` and `--gtest_repeat` options in test runs to detect flaky behavior early.
</Tip>

### c. Minimize External Dependencies in Tests
Tests should avoid reliance on fragile external services (network, hardware). Use mocks where possible to isolate tests.

### d. Manage Test Environment
Ensure the CI environment matches your test assumptions:

- Use containerization or standardized build agents.
- Seed any randomness for reproducibility.

---

## 4. Writing and Managing Tests for Continuous Integration

### a. Use Test Fixtures and Parameterized Tests
Structure tests with `TEST_F` and parameterized tests for reusability and coverage.

### b. Apply Mocking Judiciously
Use GoogleMock to simulate dependencies for:

- Enabling fast, reliable unit tests.
- Testing failure paths otherwise hard to reproduce.

### c. Control Mock Strictness Modes
Choose appropriate mock strictness according to your needs:

- `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for unexpected calls.
- `NaggyMock` (default) warns on uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Use strict mocks for critical code paths, but prefer nice mocks during development for less noise.

### d. Set Up Default and Specific Behaviors
Use `ON_CALL` to define default mock behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` for precise call expectations. This prevents unintended test failures.

<Tip>
Avoid over-specifying expectations as it can make tests brittle and hard to maintain; prefer verifying only necessary behaviors.
</Tip>

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Do not mock classes you do not own** — prefer creating own adaptors and interfaces.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_ptr)` if your mock object has controlled lifetime outside the test scope.
- Always verify and clear expectations explicitly with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` if applicable.
- Use sequences and `InSequence` constructs to verify call orders when needed.
- Document your mocks and expectations clearly to improve team maintenance.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

### Symptom: Test framework not found or linked
- Confirm GoogleTest/GMock libraries are linked and headers included correctly.
- Validate using "Validating Your Installation" guide.

### Symptom: Tests fail silently or with unexpected errors
- Check mock expectations order; expectations must precede code that exercises mocks.
- Ensure mock destructors are virtual.

### Symptom: CI shows flaky tests
- Add retry or shuffle parameters.
- Use mocks to isolate environment-dependent behaviors.

### Symptom: Test output not understood
- Run tests with `--gtest_verbose=info` or GoogleMock verbose flags to see detailed call traces.

<Tip>
Refer to the "Common Installation & Configuration Issues" and "Mocking Techniques" guides for detailed solutions.
