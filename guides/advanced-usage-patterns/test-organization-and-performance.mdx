# Test Organization and Performance Optimization

Optimize your large test suites to achieve rapid feedback and maintain clarity. This guide helps you organize tests effectively, parallelize execution, filter tests from the command line, and integrate GoogleTest seamlessly with build systems.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Covers
This guide empowers you to:
- Structure large test suites for better maintainability.
- Execute tests in parallel to reduce total testing time.
- Use command-line options to filter and run subsets of tests.
- Integrate GoogleTest with Bazel and CMake build systems for efficient execution.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest usage and test writing.
- An existing large suite of GoogleTest tests.
- A configured test executable built with GoogleTest.

### Expected Outcomes
By following this guide, you will:
- Organize tests using filters and parameterized mechanisms.
- Run tests concurrently where possible.
- Use environment variables and flags to control test execution precisely.
- Integrate and optimize your tests within your build system for improved developer productivity.

### Time Estimate
15-30 minutes for initial setup and learning.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate. Requires understanding of test suites and command-line tooling.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Organizing Large Test Suites

GoogleTest supports powerful mechanisms to keep even very large test suites manageable.

- **Use Parameterized or Typed Tests:** These help avoid duplication and organize tests logically by input values or types.
- **Use Fixture Classes:** Share setup/teardown code and resources across related tests efficiently.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {
  // You can put common fixture code here
};

TEST_P(FooTest, WorksForVariousParams) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(param));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ValidInputs, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 5));
```

### 2. Parallelizing Test Execution

Run tests in parallel to speed up feedback. This can be done externally via your build system or through test sharding.

- **Using Environment Variables:** Set `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` to the number of parallel test slices and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to the shard ID (zero-based) to split tests across machines or processes.

Example:
```sh
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0  # This machine runs shard 0
./my_tests
```

- GoogleTest will automatically run only the tests belonging to the shard index.

- **Distribute shards across machines or CI pipelines for large test suites.**

### 3. Filtering Tests on the Command Line

Run subsets of your test suite with `--gtest_filter=` option.

- The filter is a colon-separated list of positive patterns, optionally followed by a minus sign and colon-separated negative patterns.

- Wildcards `*` and `?` are supported.

Examples:
```sh
# Run all tests
./my_tests --gtest_filter=*

# Run all tests in FooTest suite
./my_tests --gtest_filter=FooTest.*

# Run tests with "Check" or "Validate" in the name
./my_tests --gtest_filter=*Check*:*Validate*

# Run all tests except death tests
./my_tests --gtest_filter=-*DeathTest.*
```

### 4. Using Additional Test Flags for Optimization

- **Stop on first failure:**
  ```sh
  ./my_tests --gtest_fail_fast
  ```
  This stops the test run as soon as a failure occurs.

- **Shuffle test order:**
  ```sh
  ./my_tests --gtest_shuffle
  ```
  Helps identify order-dependent test failures.

- **Repeat tests:**
  ```sh
  ./my_tests --gtest_repeat=100
  ```
  Run tests multiple times for detecting flaky issues.

- **Generate reports:**
  Use `--gtest_output` for XML or JSON reports, useful in CI.

### 5. Integrating GoogleTest with Build Systems

#### Bazel

- Use the `cc_test` rule.
- Bazel supports test sharding out of the box using `--test_sharding_strategy` and flags for total shards/index.

Example command:
```sh
bazel test --test_sharding_strategy=explicit --test_total_shards=4 --test_shard_index=2 //my/package:my_test
```

#### CMake

- Link GoogleTest to your test target.
- Run the test executable with flags as described above.
- Use third-party tools or CTest for parallel execution.

Example command:
```sh
ctest -j8
```

### 6. Best Practices

- Use `DISABLED_` prefix to temporarily disable flaky or broken tests.
- Avoid over-filtering tests in CI to preserve broad coverage.
- Make use of `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests conditionally at runtime.
- Regularly review test durations to identify slow tests for possible improvement.

## Examples & Usage

### Running Subsets of Tests

```sh
# Run only tests in a specific suite, except the "Bar" test
./my_test --gtest_filter=MySuite.*-MySuite.Bar
```

### Parallel Execution via Sharding

```sh
# On machine 1
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 ./all_tests

# On machine 2
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1 ./all_tests

# On machine 3
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2 ./all_tests
```

Each machine runs a disjoint subset, accelerating the full suite run.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Test not running due to incorrect suite/test name filter:** Verify casing and underscore restrictions in test names.
- **Tests don’t run in parallel:** Confirm your infrastructure respects `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`.
- **Sharded test results are incomplete:** Make sure all shards run the same executable and environment variables.

### Tips

- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to inspect all available tests.
- Use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` if you want to verify disabled tests temporarily.
- Use `--gtest_fail_if_no_test_selected` to ensure your filters are correct.

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid heavy setup in `SetUp()`; consider `SetUpTestSuite()` for expensive shared setup.
- Disable verbose logging in tests to reduce output overhead.
- Use fast matchers and avoid complex predicates where possible.
