# Effective Use of Matchers

This guide provides practical guidance for leveraging GoogleTest and GoogleMock matchers to write expressive, robust, and maintainable test assertions. You will learn how to apply both built-in and custom matchers effectively, combine matchers for advanced test scenarios, and understand best practices to produce clear and reliable tests.

---

## 1. Understanding Matchers

Matchers in GoogleMock are predicates used to verify that mock method arguments satisfy certain conditions. They can be simple, matching a single value, or composed to express complex constraints.

Matchers work seamlessly with `EXPECT_CALL` and `EXPECT_THAT` assertions.

---

## 2. Basic Matcher Usage

Use matchers to specify expectations on mock method arguments or to assert properties about values.

### Examples

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::Eq;
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Gt;

// Matches exact value
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(Eq(5)));

// Matches anything
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(_));

// Matches values greater than 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(Gt(10))); 
```

### Omitting Argument Matchers

For methods that are not overloaded, you can omit arguments to match any:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo);  // Expects any call to Foo with any arguments
```

---

## 3. Combining Matchers

Advanced scenarios require composing multiple conditions on arguments. GoogleMock provides logical combinators:

- `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)` — all matchers must match
- `AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)` — any matcher matches
- `Not(m)` — negates matcher `m`

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Bar(AllOf(Gt(5), Ne(10))));  // Value > 5 and != 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Bar(Not(HasSubstr("error"))));  // String without "error"
```

---

## 4. Custom Matchers

When built-in matchers are insufficient, create custom matchers using the `MATCHER` macros. These allow expressive predicates and detailed failure messages.

### Basic Custom Matcher Example

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

MATCHER(IsEven, "") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

// Usage:
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(IsEven()));
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsEven());
```

If the matcher fails, an informative message like "Value of: value\nExpected: is even\n  Actual: 7" is displayed.

### Custom Matcher with Descriptions and Explanation

```cpp
MATCHER_P(InRange, range, "") {
  bool result = arg >= range.first && arg <= range.second;

  if (!result && result_listener != nullptr) {
    *result_listener << "which is " << arg << ", outside range [" << range.first << ", " << range.second << "]";
  }
  return result;
}

// Usage:
EXPECT_THAT(val, InRange(std::make_pair(0, 10)));
```

---

## 5. Matching Container Contents

Matchers can assert properties on containers:

- `ElementsAre(...)`: expects elements to match provided matchers in order.
- `UnorderedElementsAre(...)`: expects all elements to match matchers ignoring order.
- `Contains(m)`: expects at least one element in container matches matcher `m`.
- `SizeIs(m)`: expects container size to satisfy matcher `m`.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, ProcessNumbers(ElementsAre(1, Gt(5), _)));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, UnorderedElementsAre(3, 5, 1));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, Contains(Gt(10)));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, SizeIs(3));
```

Use nested matchers to validate complex container elements, such as pairs or structs.

---

## 6. Matching Object Fields and Properties

You can match specific members or properties of objects passed as arguments.

- `Field(&Class::member, matcher)`: Matches the member variable.
- `Property(&Class::getMethod, matcher)`: Matches the return of a const getter.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(Field(&MyClass::value, Eq(42))));
EXPECT_THAT(obj, Property(&MyClass::GetName, StartsWith("John")));
```

If the pointer argument can be null, these matchers automatically fail on null pointers.

---

## 7. Matching Pointer Values

Use pointer-aware matchers:

- `IsNull()`: Matches null pointer.
- `NotNull()`: Matches non-null pointer.
- `Pointee(matcher)`: Matches pointer whose pointee matches `matcher`.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(Pointee(Ge(10))));  // Pointer to value >= 10
EXPECT_THAT(ptr, NotNull());
EXPECT_THAT(ptr, IsNull());
```

You can nest `Pointee(Pointee(...))` for pointers to pointers.

---

## 8. Using Matchers in `EXPECT_CALL` and `EXPECT_THAT`

Matchers are integrated naturally:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Bar(Ge(10)));
EXPECT_THAT(result, StartsWith("hello"));
```

Use matchers to increase the expressiveness and precision of your tests.

---

## 9. Safe and Explicit Casting of Matchers

Matchers are statically typed to prevent misuses. When you have type differences (e.g., matching an `int` argument but your matcher is for `long`), use:

- `SafeMatcherCast<T>(matcher)` — casts safely ensuring no loss of information.
- `MatcherCast<T>(matcher)` — less strict cast; be cautious as this may be unsafe.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(SafeMatcherCast<int>(Gt(5L))));
```

---

## 10. Best Practices and Tips

- **Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behavior**, and use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly for explicit call verification.
- **Avoid overly strict matchers** to reduce brittle tests.
- **Combine matchers** to clarify intent and improve failure messages.
- **Use named custom matchers** instead of ad-hoc lambdas where reuse or clarity is needed.
- **Wrap complex argument verification using matchers instead of manually saved arguments**, to decrease test maintenance.
- **Suppress warnings about uninteresting calls with `NiceMock`**, but be aware of when unexpected calls are errors.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting Common Matcher Issues

- **Type mismatch errors:** Ensure you are passing correct types or use `SafeMatcherCast` to convert.
- **Overloaded method ambiguity:** Use disambiguating techniques such as `Const()` or explicit matcher types.
- **Unexpected matcher failures:** Verify that your matchers' logic and parameters are correct; custom matchers can stream diagnostic messages with `result_listener`.
- **NULL pointer dereferences:** Use `NotNull()` or check pointers before using pointer matchers.

---

## 12. Advanced Matcher Composition

### Matching Multiple Arguments as a Whole

Use `.With()` in `EXPECT_CALL` to match the whole argument tuple:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // First arg less than second
```

### Using `Args<k1, k2,...>(matcher)` to match subsets of arguments:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_, _, _))
    .With(AllOf(Args<0, 1>(Lt()), Args<1, 2>(Lt())));  // x < y < z
```

### Using Matchers as Predicates

Wrap matchers with `Matches()` to use them in standard algorithms or predicates:

```cpp
std::vector<int> values = ...;
int count = std::count_if(values.begin(), values.end(), Matches(Gt(10)));
```
