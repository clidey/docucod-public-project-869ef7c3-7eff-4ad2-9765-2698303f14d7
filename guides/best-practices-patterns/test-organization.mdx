# Organizing and Structuring Test Code

GoogleTest empowers you to write expressive, maintainable C++ tests that scale with your projects. This page focuses specifically on effective strategies and concrete recommendations to structure your test code, ensuring readability, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

---

## 1. Why Structure Your Tests?

Good organization of test code helps you and your team rapidly identify, understand, and maintain tests. When tests reflect the structure of the production code and follow consistent patterns, you'll achieve:

- **Clarity:** Tests clearly communicate intent.
- **Reusability:** Shared setups and helpers reduce duplication.
- **Scalability:** Tests grow gracefully with your codebase.
- **Debugging Efficiency:** Failures locate precise causes quickly.

---

## 2. Naming Conventions

### Test Suites and Tests

- Use **valid C++ identifiers** without underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names to avoid macro expansion and linking issues ([see FAQ](../faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)).
- Test suite names should generally match the class or component under test.
- Test names should describe the specific behavior or scenario tested.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

### Fixture Classes

- Name fixture classes ending with `Test` for easy identification.
- If multiple test suites share behavior, use inheritance or typedefs to avoid duplications.

**Example:**
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test { ... };
using PriorityQueueTest = QueueTest;
```

---

## 3. Test Suite Design

### Grouping Related Tests

- Group tests in **test suites** that reflect production code classes or modules.
- Avoid mixing unrelated tests in the same suite to reduce coupling and confusion.

### Use of Test Fixtures

- Use `TEST_F` with fixtures to reuse setup and teardown code across multiple tests operating on similar data.
- Ensure your fixture class:
  - Has a default constructor (possibly implicit).
  - Defines configuration in constructor or `SetUp()`.
  - Cleans up in destructor or `TearDown()` if necessary.

**Example:**
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2); q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_, q1_, q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Per-Test vs. Per-Suite Setup

- Use the fixture constructor or `SetUp()` for per-test initialization.
- Use `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive shared setup/teardown that applies to the entire suite.

**Best Practice Tips:**
- Make shared resources static members.
- Ensure tests don’t leave shared resources in inconsistent states.

---

## 4. Separation of Concerns

### Test Logic

- Keep each test focused on a **single behavior** or **scenario**.
- Minimize dependencies among tests to allow isolated execution.

### Helper Functions

- Extract common sequences or checks into utility functions or fixture methods.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add context in failures when calling helpers, making debugging easier.

**Example:**
```cpp
void VerifyQueueIsEmpty(Queue<int>& q) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q.size(), 0);
  EXPECT_EQ(q.Dequeue(), nullptr);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, ClearWorks) {
  q1_.Clear();
  SCOPED_TRACE("After Clear()");
  VerifyQueueIsEmpty(q1_);
}
```

---

## 5. Reuse Strategies

- Use **inheritance** for sharing fixture logic among test suites.
- Use **typedefs or `using` aliases** to reuse fixture classes without duplication.
- Share expensive resources where practical using `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`.

---

## 6. Consistency and Pitfalls to Avoid

### Consistency

- Always use the same fixture class across the entire test suite.
- Mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` in the same suite is illegal and triggers runtime errors.
- Refrain from using underscores in test suite and test names to avoid name collision issues.

### Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to define a default constructor for the fixture class.
- Modifying shared resources in a test and forgetting to restore state.
- Using `ASSERT_*` where test continuation on failure is needed, or vice versa.
- Mixing test macros inappropriately within the same test suite.

---

## 7. Advanced Structuring Techniques

### Parameterized Tests

- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to run the same test logic over varying input parameters.
- This reduces code duplication and improves coverage.

### Typed Tests

- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` for testing multiple types with the same test logic.

See the [Parameterized and Typed Tests Guide](../core-testing-workflows/advanced-parameterized-tests.mdx) for examples and details.

## 8. Example: Organizing a Set of Tests for a Queue

```cpp
// Fixture definition
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;  // Empty queue
  Queue<int> q1_;  // One element
  Queue<int> q2_;  // Two elements
};

// Test for initial size
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

// Test Dequeue behavior
TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);  // Use ASSERT_ to avoid dereferencing nullptr
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  delete n;
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
}

// Shared setup for expensive resource (if any) via SetUpTestSuite
class ExpensiveSetupTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* ExpensiveSetupTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Structural Issues

### Runtime Error: Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the Same Suite

GoogleTest enforces that all tests in the same test suite use the same fixture. Mixing these will cause runtime errors:

```
All tests in the same test suite must use the same test fixture class, so mixing TEST_F and TEST in the same test suite is illegal.
```

**Fix:** Move `TEST`-based tests to a different suite or convert them to `TEST_F`.

### Compilation Error: Missing Default Constructor in Fixture

If your fixture defines a non-default constructor, GoogleTest needs a default constructor for test instantiation.

**Fix:** Add a default constructor explicitly.

### Naming Collisions with Underscores

Avoid underscores in test and suite names to prevent macro and class naming collisions.

**Fix:** Use CamelCase or concatenated words without underscores.

## 10. Additional Best Practices

- Prefer `EXPECT_` when you want to continue after failure; prefer `ASSERT_` when continuation makes no sense.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` in helper functions to clarify context for failures.
- Avoid global variables; use fixtures instead to isolate state.
- Use `FRIEND_TEST` when testing private members, keeping tests in the same namespace.
