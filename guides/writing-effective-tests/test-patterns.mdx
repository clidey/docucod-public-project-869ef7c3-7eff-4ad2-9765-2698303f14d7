# Test Organization and Patterns

Learn best practices for structuring test code, sharing setup and teardown logic, and applying proven patterns for scalable test suites. This tutorial focuses on maintainability for growing codebases.

---

## Overview

As your codebase grows, well-organized tests become essential to ensure reliability and maintainability. This guide helps you structure test suites effectively, reuse setup and teardown logic, and apply common design patterns that keep your tests clean, scalable, and easy to understand.

### What You Will Learn

- How to organize tests into logical units reflecting your code structure.
- Best practices for sharing fixture setup and teardown to reduce duplication.
- Design patterns adapted for tests, including parameterized and typed tests.
- Techniques to maintain scalable, maintainable testing code over time.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you:

- Have a working knowledge of GoogleTest basics: writing simple tests, test fixtures, and assertions.
- Have set up GoogleTest in your development environment. (See [Writing and Running Your First Test](../getting-started/first-run-configuration-troubleshooting/writing-and-running-your-first-test)).
- Understand C++ test and fixture declaration with `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, etc.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Organize your tests into unit-reflective test suites and avoid tangled or redundant tests.
- Leverage test fixtures efficiently to share code and resources.
- Create reusable and robust parameterized and typed tests that cover more ground with less code.

### Estimated Time

Approximately 20–30 minutes, depending on familiarity with GoogleTest and your use case.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate. Familiarity with basic test writing and fixtures is assumed.

## Structuring Your Tests

### 1. Group Tests by Behavior or Module

Tests should be grouped logically to reflect the component or behavior they verify. This organization helps testers and developers quickly locate and understand relevant tests.

- Use **test suites** to group related tests on the same class, module, or feature.
- Name suites clearly and consistently (e.g., `QueueTest` for your `Queue` class).

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Both belong to the `FactorialTest` suite—they test related behavior.

### 2. Use Test Fixtures to Share Setup and Teardown

When multiple tests require common setup or resource management, use a **test fixture** by inheriting from `testing::Test` and then define tests with `TEST_F()`.

- Implement `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for per-test setup and cleanup.
- For expensive setup shared across tests, use `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to set up and tear down once per suite.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(1);
  }

  Queue<int> queue_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsNotEmptyAfterSetup) {
  EXPECT_NE(queue_.Dequeue(), nullptr);
}
```

### 3. Avoid Inter-Test Dependencies

Each test should be independent, so tests can run in any order without side effects. GoogleTest creates a fresh fixture object for each test, ensuring isolation.

## Advanced Test Patterns

### 1. Parameterized Tests

When the same logic should be tested across multiple input values, write **value-parameterized tests** using:

- Define a fixture inheriting from `testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
- Use `TEST_P` macro for each test variant.
- Instantiate tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` supplying parameters.

**Example:**

```cpp
class FiboTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FiboTest, HandlesFactorial) {
  int input = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GE(Factorial(input), 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    KnownValues, FiboTest, testing::Values(0, 1, 3, 5));
```

This runs the test with parameters 0, 1, 3, and 5.

### 2. Typed Tests

When you want to run the exact same tests for different types, use **typed tests**:

- Define a class template fixture derived from `testing::Test`.
- List your types via `using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<Type1, Type2, ...>`.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` to associate your fixture with the type list.
- Write tests using `TYPED_TEST` macro.

**Example:**

```cpp
template <typename T>
class ContainerTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  // Fixture members here
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<std::vector<int>, std::list<int>>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(ContainerTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(ContainerTest, StartsEmpty) {
  TypeParam container;
  EXPECT_TRUE(container.empty());
}
```

### 3. Type-Parameterized Tests

For reusable testing patterns where the types will be supplied later:

- Define test fixtures and tests with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P`.
- Register tests using `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Instantiate them multiple times as needed using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

This pattern helps maintain reusable and modular typed test logic.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Name Your Tests Meaningfully:** Choose descriptive test suite and test names reflecting intent.

- **Keep Tests Small:** Limit tests to checking a single behavior or condition.

- **Use Assertions Wisely:** Mix fatal (`ASSERT_*`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) assertions to balance test flow and error reporting.

- **Parameter Name Generators:** When using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`, provide custom name generators to create readable test identifiers for parameterized tests.

- **Suppress Instantiation Warnings:** Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` if a test suite isn’t always instantiated.

- **Avoid Underscores in Test Names:** GoogleTest prefers test and suite names without underscore (`_`) characters for filtering compatibility.

- **Organize Source Code:** Place related tests and fixtures in dedicated source and header files to improve maintainability.

- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` for Diagnostics:** Add context to assertions within helper functions or loops.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Tests Not Running or Being Listed

- Make sure all tests are defined at global or namespace scope (not inside functions).
- Confirm `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` is called for your parameterized tests.
- Check for accidental `DISABLED_` prefixes in test names.

### Issue: Duplicate or Invalid Parameter Names

- Validate that custom parameter name generators produce unique, valid-identifiers.
- Avoid spaces, dashes, or characters other than letters, digits, and underscores.

### Issue: `GetParam()` or `TypeParam` Not Recognized

- Verify your fixture inherits from `TestWithParam<T>` for parameterized tests.
- Ensure `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` or `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` macros are correctly used.

### Issue: Fixture Setup Not Called

- `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` methods must be marked `public` when used with `TEST_P`.
