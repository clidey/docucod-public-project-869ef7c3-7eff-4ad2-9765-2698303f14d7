## Enhancing Mock Behavior with NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock

GoogleMock provides three wrapper templates to control how mocks handle uninteresting calls — calls to mock methods without explicit expectations:

- **`NiceMock<T>`**: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls. Use this when you want cleaner test output without noise from unimportant calls.
- **`NaggyMock<T>`**: The default behavior of mocks. Warns when uninteresting calls happen, helping you spot unexpected behavior.
- **`StrictMock<T>`**: Treats all uninteresting calls as errors, failing the test immediately on unexpected mock method calls.

**Usage Example:**

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

class MockFoo { 
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (), ());
};

void TestFunction() {
  NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(nice_mock, DoSomething());  // No warnings for other calls.

  NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(naggy_mock, DoSomething()); // Warns on other calls.

  StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(strict_mock, DoSomething()); // Fails on other calls.
}
```

**Key points:**
- They inherit constructors of the underlying mock, allowing seamless integration.
- Should only be applied once per mock class hierarchy.
- `NiceMock` reduces noise in tests where only specific mock calls matter.
- `StrictMock` helps enforce very tight control, useful during debugging or critical test suites.

## Creating Custom Actions for Mock Methods

Often, the built-in GoogleMock actions like `Return()`, `Invoke()`, or `SetArgPointee()` are sufficient. But in complex scenarios, especially when mocking functions with side effects or special behaviors, you'll need custom actions.

### Simple Lambda-based Actions

The easiest way to create a custom action is with a lambda or callable that satisfies the mock method's signature:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(_))
    .WillOnce([](int arg) { 
      // Custom behavior
      return arg * 2;
    });
```

This lambda will be used once when `SomeMethod` is called, performing the custom logic.

### Defining Reusable Action Classes

For more reusable or complex behavior, define a struct or class with a call operator:

```cpp
struct MultiplyBy {
  int factor;
  int operator()(int x) const { return x * factor; }
};

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(_))
    .WillOnce(MultiplyBy{3}); // Returns argument multiplied by 3
```

### Using `ACTION` Macros (Legacy)

You can create actions using the `ACTION` or `ACTION_P` macros, which let you write the action body with named parameters like `arg0`, `arg1`, etc.

```cpp
ACTION(IncrementArg0) {
  return arg0 + 1;
}

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(_))
    .WillOnce(IncrementArg0());
```

### Polymorphic Actions

If you want your action to be usable with different function signatures, you can implement the `Perform()` template method in a class and wrap it using `MakePolymorphicAction()`.

Example: Return the second argument of any mock method call.

```cpp
class ReturnSecondArg {
 public:
  template <typename Result, typename ArgTuple>
  Result Perform(const ArgTuple& args) const {
    return std::get<1>(args);
  }
};

auto ReturnSecondArgument() {
  return testing::MakePolymorphicAction(ReturnSecondArg());
}

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(_, _))
    .WillOnce(ReturnSecondArgument());
```

This flexibility can be powerful for sophisticated mocking needs.

## Using Matchers to Handle Complex Argument Matching

Matchers in GoogleMock allow you to precisely specify expected argument values beyond direct equality.

### Basic and Composed Matchers

- `_`: Wildcard matching anything.
- `Eq(value)`: Matches exact equality.
- `Ge(value)`, `Lt(value)`: Comparisons.
- `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`: Combine matchers logically.

Example: Expect a call where the integer argument is both >=5 and not 10.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(AllOf(Ge(5), Not(Eq(10)))));
```

### Matching By Member Variables or Properties

You can match complex arguments by members or methods using `Field()` and `Property()`.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething(Field(&MyClass::member_var, Ge(10))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething(Property(&MyClass::GetValue, Eq(5))));
```

### Matching Containers and Nested Containers

Matchers like `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()` help validate container contents precisely:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(std::vector<int>{}));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(ElementsAre(1, Ge(2), _)));
```

Use `Pointee()` to match the value pointed by pointers or smart pointers.

### Custom Matchers

For very specific matching needs, define your own matcher class or use `MATCHER` macros.

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy3, "is divisible by 3") {
  return (arg % 3) == 0;
}
...
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, SomeMethod(IsDivisibleBy3()));
```

See [Writing New Matchers](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md#NewMatchers) for detailed recipes.

---

## Combining Matchers and Actions for Flexible Tests

You can write expectations that act differently based on argument matching by layering expectations with different matchers and actions:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(_))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(false));  // Default
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(Eq(42)))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(true));   // Specific argument
```

The latest matching expectation takes precedence.

Use `.With()` clauses to combine argument-wise matchers into tuples for advanced conditions:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Combine(_, _))
    .With(Lt())  // First arg < second arg
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

You can chain multiple `WillOnce()` to perform sequenced actions, transitioning to `WillRepeatedly()` after that.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- Always set `EXPECT_CALL` expectations **before** exercising code under test.
- Over-specifying method arguments makes tests brittle: prefer necessary matchers only.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` when defining expectations with fixed call counts to avoid upper-bound errors on excess calls.
- When mocking overloaded or const-qualified methods, be explicit with qualifiers and overload resolution helpers like `Const()`.
- For move-only types (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`), prefer lambdas or functors over default actions.
- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress unnecessary warnings, but avoid hiding errors unintentionally by always thoroughly reviewing test output.

---

## Troubleshooting and Tips

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Unexpected call warnings:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` to allow extra calls or switch to `NiceMock`.
- **Order of calls not enforced:** Use `InSequence` or `After()` clauses for ordering.
- **Unmatching arguments:** Review matchers and types, using `SafeMatcherCast` if needed to ensure matcher compatibility.
- **Performance issues compiling large mocks:** Move mock constructor and destructor implementations to `.cc` files.

### Pro Tips

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls and expectations.
- Break tests into smaller scopes with sequences and checkpoints for better diagnostics.
- Employ `ON_CALL` to set default mock behaviors differently from expectations.

<Tip>
Always set expectations before invoking the mock and be mindful that expectations are "sticky" by default — use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid unexpected over-call errors.
</Tip>

<Note>
If you encounter errors with complex argument types or overloaded methods, use explicit matcher casting (`SafeMatcherCast`) and overload disambiguation techniques.
</Note>

<Warning>
StrictMock is powerful but can make tests brittle; prefer using NiceMock and only switch to StrictMock when you need strict verification.
