# Structuring and Organizing Test Suites

## Overview

This guide helps you structure, organize, and maintain your GoogleTest tests effectively, especially as your codebase and test suites scale. You'll learn best practices for grouping tests, naming conventions, designing shared fixtures, and managing the lifecycle of tests for clarity, maintainability, and scalability.


---

## Why Organize Your Tests?

Think of your tests as the documentation and safety net for your code. A well-structured test suite:

- Clearly reflects the architecture and responsibilities of your code base.
- Makes it easier to locate, add, and maintain tests.
- Enables efficient test runs by isolating related tests and sharing setup resources.
- Supports collaborative work and onboarding of new team members.

Because tests grow alongside features, structuring them thoughtfully from the start saves time and frustration later.


---

## Best Practices for Grouping Tests

### Use Meaningful Test Suites

- Group related tests into **test suites** (`TEST` or `TEST_F`) that correspond to logical units such as classes, modules, or features.
- The test suite name should be descriptive of the code under test.

```cpp
// Good example: all tests target the Queue class behavior
TEST(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) { ... }
TEST(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) { ... }
```

### Employ Test Fixtures for Shared Setup

- When multiple tests use the same data or need a common setup/teardown routine, define a **test fixture** class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Put shared objects and initialization in the fixture to avoid duplication.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  ...
}
```

### Follow Naming Conventions

- Test suite and test names should follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Names).
- Avoid underscores `_` in test case names; prefer camel case or PascalCase.
- Name tests to clearly convey what behavior they verify.

## Organizing File and Directory Layout

### Reflect Code Structure

Arrange test files and directories to mirror your source code hierarchy:

```
/project_root
  /src
    /graphics
      turtle.h
      turtle.cc
  /tests
    /graphics
      turtle_test.cc
```

### Keep Tests Close to Code

Place tests near the code they verify to ease navigation and maintenance.

### Name Test Files Clearly

Use consistent suffixes like `_test.cc` or `_unittest.cc`:
- `turtle_test.cc` for tests of the `turtle` module.
- Avoid ambiguous names; keep test file names aligned with their purpose.

### Shared Fixtures and Helpers

For reusable fixtures or test helpers used across multiple test suites, group them in shared test utilities.


---

## Managing Shared Fixtures

### Use Fixture Classes for Shared State

When tests need common data, use the fixture’s constructor or `SetUp()` to initialize shared objects. Use `TearDown()` or destructor for cleanup.

### Do Not Share State Between Tests

Each test gets a fresh fixture. Do **not** rely on side effects or persistent state across tests.

### Prefer `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` over Constructor/Destructor

Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` if setup can fail or exceptions may be thrown; these allow better test isolation.

### Organize Fixtures by Domain

Create specific fixture classes that correspond to the test domain or modules to limit their scope and complexity.


---

## Test Lifecycle Management

GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance for every test. This guarantees isolation and repeatability.

### Lifecycle Flow for Each Test in a Fixture

1. Construct a fixture instance.
2. Run the fixture’s constructor (if any).
3. Call `SetUp()`.
4. Run the test body.
5. Call `TearDown()`.
6. Run the fixture’s destructor.

### Designing SetUp and TearDown

- Keep setup fast and lightweight for quick test runs.
- Avoid sharing state by using static variables unless absolutely necessary.
- Resources allocated during `SetUp()` should be released in `TearDown()`.

### Sharing Expensive Resources

For expensive shared resources (e.g., databases, network sockets), consider writing custom test suite classes or external setup utilities, but keep in mind the risk of test dependencies and flaky tests.


---

## Tips & Common Pitfalls

### Tips

- **Group logically:** Tests for a class or module belong in the same suite.
- **Be explicit:** Use `TEST_F` only when you have a fixture.
- **Name thoughtfully:** Descriptive names help quickly understand test intent.
- **Use sequences for order:** Use `InSequence` if call order matters.
- **Refactor fixtures:** Large fixtures indicate you might want to split tests or restructure.

### Common Pitfalls

- Sharing state between tests leads to flaky results.
- Overly strict expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) can cause brittle tests.
- Mixing naming styles in a single codebase confuses collaborators.
- Having many small files with too few tests fragments the test suite.
- Too large fixtures slow down test runs and complicate maintenance.

## Summary

By structuring and organizing your GoogleTest suites, you'll create maintainable, clear, and scalable tests. Follow conventions, group related tests in suites and fixtures, and manage setup and teardown carefully to keep your tests independent and fast.

## Quick Checklist Before Adding a New Test

- Does the test logically belong to an existing test suite, or is a new suite needed?
- Use `TEST` for simple cases, `TEST_F` if shared fixture needed?
- Are descriptive names used for both suite and test?
- Is fixture setUp/tearDown minimal and isolated?
- Avoid inter-test dependencies?

Happy testing! Remember, tests are as important as your production code – structure them like you mean it.
