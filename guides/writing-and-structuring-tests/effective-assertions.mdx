# Using GoogleTest Assertions Effectively

Explore the comprehensive capabilities of GoogleTest assertions to write precise, maintainable, and informative unit tests. This guide empowers you to select the right assertion macros, understand their behavior, and leverage advanced options including matchers and predicate assertions for clear and robust verification.

---

## 1. Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
This guide walks you through the essential and advanced assertion macros provided by GoogleTest for verifying code behavior effectively. It helps you understand the difference between non-fatal and fatal assertions, use built-in and custom matchers, handle common testing scenarios, and integrate assertion outcomes into your test workflows.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with C++ unit testing
- GoogleTest installed and set up in your environment
- Understanding of test cases and test fixtures

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will confidently write assertions that clearly communicate test intent, provide meaningful diagnostics, and help you catch bugs precisely.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20-30 minutes to read and experiment with examples.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. GoogleTest Assertions Overview

### Assertion Types and Behavior
GoogleTest assertions come in pairs of macros: `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_`.

- **`EXPECT_` macros** generate nonfatal failures and allow tests to continue.
- **`ASSERT_` macros** generate fatal failures and abort the current function.

Use `EXPECT_` when you want your test to proceed despite failures to collect multiple errors. Use `ASSERT_` when a failure should prevent further execution because continuing makes no sense or may cause crashes.

### Basic Assertion Examples
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition) << "Condition failed reason";
ASSERT_EQ(value1, value2);
```

### Stream Custom Failure Messages
All assertions support streaming custom messages using `<<`, which prints when the assertion fails:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Invalid value detected: " << value;
```

---

## 3. Explicit Success and Failure

### SUCCEED()
Use when you want to indicate an explicit test success point for documentation or flow control.

```cpp
SUCCEED();  // Marks this point as a success.
```

### FAIL()
Use to generate an immediate fatal failure, causing function exit.

```cpp
if (unexpected_case) {
  FAIL() << "Unexpected path triggered.";
}
```

### ADD_FAILURE()
Use to add nonfatal failures and continue.

```cpp
if (some_check_fails) {
  ADD_FAILURE() << "Check failed but test continues.";
}
```

---

## 4. Generalized Assertions with Matchers

### EXPECT_THAT()
Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` to verify that a value satisfies a matcher predicate.

Example:
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::AllOf;

EXPECT_THAT(string_value, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(number, AllOf(::testing::Gt(5), ::testing::Lt(10)));
```

This assertion produces highly readable diagnostic messages, showing actual and expected values.

See [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md) for available matchers.

---

## 5. Boolean and Binary Comparison Assertions

### Common Boolean Assertions
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)`

### Binary Comparison Assertions
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` — tests `val1 == val2`
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)` — tests `val1 != val2`
- `EXPECT_LT(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_LT(val1, val2)` — tests `val1 < val2`
- `EXPECT_LE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_LE(val1, val2)` — tests `val1 <= val2`
- `EXPECT_GT(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_GT(val1, val2)` — tests `val1 > val2`
- `EXPECT_GE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_GE(val1, val2)` — tests `val1 >= val2`

### Notes
- When comparing C strings, use `EXPECT_STREQ` instead of `EXPECT_EQ` to compare by value.

---

## 6. String Comparison Assertions

For comparing C strings (null-terminated character arrays):

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)` — equal contents
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)` — different contents
- Case-insensitive variants: `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASENE`

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ("hello", my_c_str);
```

---

## 7. Floating-Point Comparison

Floating-point values should not be compared with `EXPECT_EQ` due to rounding errors. Use:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` — compares floats up to 4 ULPs
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` — compares doubles
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` / `ASSERT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` — tests absolute difference

---

## 8. Predicate Assertions

These assertions verify predicates that are more complex than simple Boolean checks.

### EXPECT_PRED and Variants
They verify that a predicate function returns true for given arguments.

Example:
```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return (n % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

### EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT and Variants
If you want richer failure messages, use a predicate-formatter that generates human-readable messages on failure:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsPrimePredicate(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (IsPrime(n)) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " is not prime.";
}
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsPrimePredicate, value);
```

---

## 9. Exception Assertions (Requires Exceptions Enabled)

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` / `ASSERT_THROW`
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW`
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW`

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(MyFunction(), std::runtime_error);
```

---

## 10. Death Assertions

For testing code that terminates the process (fails fatally):

- `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, matcher)` / `ASSERT_DEATH`
- `EXPECT_EXIT(statement, predicate, matcher)` / `ASSERT_EXIT`
- `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH` (runs only in debug mode)

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ DoSomethingDangerous(); }, "Fatal error occurred");
```

---

## 11. Best Practices and Tips

### Choosing Between EXPECT_ and ASSERT_
Use `ASSERT_` when failure means continuation would be unsafe or meaningless, such as invalid test setup. Use `EXPECT_` when you want to collect multiple failures.

### Stream Messages Judiciously
Adding custom failure messages helps quickly pinpoint issues but avoid excessive verbosity.

### Using Matchers Effectively
Matchers provide expressive, reusable argument validation. Use built-in matchers or define custom ones for clarity.

### Avoid Over-Specification
Only assert what your test truly depends on, to reduce brittle tests.

### Use Predicate Assertions for Complex Checks
They allow precise feedback beyond simple Boolean expectations.

### Take Advantage of Floating-Point Assertions
Avoid direct equality on floating-point values.

### Verify Exception Conditions
Use exception assertions to ensure error branches work as expected.

### Use Death Assertions Sparingly
They test fatal failures reliably but can slow down test suites.

## 14. Example Code Snippets

### Simple Expectations
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MathTest, BasicAssertions) {
  int x = 5, y = 10;
  EXPECT_LT(x, y) << "x should be less than y";
  ASSERT_EQ(x + y, 15) << "Sum should be 15";
}
```

### Using Matchers
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::AllOf;

TEST(StringTest, MatcherExample) {
  std::string text = "Hello, World!";

  EXPECT_THAT(text, StartsWith("Hello"));
  EXPECT_THAT(text, AllOf(::testing::Not(::testing::EndsWith("!")),
                         StartsWith("Hello"))); // This will fail
}
```

### Predicate Assertion
```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) {
  return n % 2 == 0;
}

testing::AssertionResult IsEvenPredicate(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " is not even";
}

TEST(NumberTest, IsEvenCheck) {
  int number = 3;
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEvenPredicate, number);  // Fails with detailed message
}
```

## 15. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Assertion Always Passes or Fails
- Ensure the assertion expression matches your intent.
- Confirm matchers used are compatible with argument types.

### Unexpected Test Abort
- Check if `ASSERT_` macros are causing early function exit.
- Use `EXPECT_` for non-critical checks.

### Predicate Assertion Fails to Compile
- Verify predicate signatures and template instantiation.

### Floating Point Comparisons Failing
- Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR` instead of `EXPECT_EQ`.

### Confusing Messages from Matchers
- Add custom failure explanation in your matcher or use predicate format assertions.
