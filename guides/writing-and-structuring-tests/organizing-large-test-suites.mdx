# Organizing and Scaling Large Test Suites

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide provides practical best practices for structuring test code in large C++ projects using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Users will learn how to organize tests effectively to enhance maintainability, scalability, and readability, including grouping tests logically, reusing code via fixtures, parameterized tests, and managing dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest test suites, test cases, and fixtures.
- Understanding of mocking concepts with GoogleMock.
- A working GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, users will be able to:
- Organize large sets of tests in a scalable manner.
- Use fixtures and parameterized tests to avoid redundant code.
- Manage dependencies and shared setup to keep tests fast and maintainable.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30-45 minutes to thoroughly apply these best practices.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Structuring Large Test Suites

### 1. Group Tests by Functionality or Module

- Organize tests into logical test suites that correspond to the production code modules or components being tested.
- Use meaningful, consistent naming conventions for test suites to reflect what they verify, e.g., `NetworkManagerTest`.

<Tip>
Grouping tests logically helps new contributors find relevant tests easily and keeps the test project organized as it grows.
</Tip>

### 2. Use Test Fixtures for Shared Setup and TearDown

- When multiple tests require the same configuration or objects, create a test fixture by deriving from `testing::Test`.
- Place the common setup code in `SetUp()` and clean-up in `TearDown()`.
- Each test will get a fresh fixture initialized automatically, ensuring test independence.

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db_.Connect();
    db_.InitSchema();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db_.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db_;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryReturnsExpectedResults) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_.Query("SELECT * FROM users"));
}
```

### 3. Leverage Parameterized Tests to Reduce Duplication

- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to test the same logic across different inputs or configurations.
- Helps cover multiple scenarios with less code.

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectFactorial) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), ExpectedFactorial(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  SmallNumbers, FactorialTest, testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
```

<Tip>
Parameterize tests to cover edge cases and inputs without writing multiple similar tests.
</Tip>

### 4. Share Common Test Logic Through Helper Functions and Base Fixtures

- Extract repetitive test code into helper functions or base fixture classes for reuse.
- Subclass base fixtures for specialized scenarios while reusing setup and utilities.

### 5. Manage Mock Dependencies Carefully

- Use mock objects to isolate units from external dependencies.
- Define mock classes close to their owning modules to minimize coupling.
- Use shared mock classes in dedicated test libraries when multiple tests depend on the same mocks.

### 6. Organize Tests by Directory Structure

- Mirror the source code directory structure in the test directories.
- Co-locate test files near the implementation files when possible.

<Note>
Avoid scattering tests in large monolithic files. Prefer multiple focused test files to improve readability and reduce merge conflicts.
</Note>

## Practical Tips for Scalable Test Suites

- Keep each test case focused on a single behavior or feature.
- Avoid overly specific expectations that make tests brittle.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior and limit `EXPECT_CALL` to what you really want to verify.
- Reuse fixtures and parameterized tests to avoid code duplication.
- Clean up resources in `TearDown()` to prevent side effects across tests.
- Use sequences or `InSequence` to enforce call order only when necessary.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### Tests Running Slow

- Avoid heavy or redundant setup in each test.
- Use shared fixtures with `SetUpTestSuite()` for expensive global resources.

### Tests Failing Due to Ordering or Unsatisfied Expectations

- Verify that `EXPECT_CALL`s are set before exercising mocks.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` or remove expectations when appropriate to avoid sticky expectations causing false failures.

### Excessive Mock Warnings

- Wrap mocks in `NiceMock<>` when uninteresting calls are expected and should be ignored.
- Use explicit catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` to avoid warnings.

<Tip>
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` flag during test runs to get detailed diagnostic messages about mock calls and expectations.
</Tip>

## Example: Organizing Tests in a Large Project

Suppose you have a project with modules `network`, `storage`, and `ui`. Here's a recommended organization:

```
project/
  src/
    network/
      connection.cc
      packet.cc
    storage/
      db.cc
      cache.cc
    ui/
      window.cc
      dialog.cc
  tests/
    network/
      connection_test.cc
      packet_test.cc
      mocks/
        mock_connection.h
    storage/
      db_test.cc
      cache_test.cc
      mocks/
        mock_db.h
    ui/
      window_test.cc
      dialog_test.cc
```

Fixtures and mock classes reside close to their modules. Parameterized tests are used for repetitive scenario checks.
