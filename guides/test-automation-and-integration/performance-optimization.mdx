# Performance Optimization and Scaling

## Accelerate Test Execution and Scale Your Test Infrastructure

GoogleTest offers advanced features to speed up your test runs, efficiently distribute load, and manage large-scale test infrastructures with reliability and rapid feedback. This guide walks you through proven techniques to optimize performance by running tests in parallel, partitioning slow suites, and tuning your infrastructure.

## 1. Understanding Performance Optimization in GoogleTest

Before diving into detailed steps, it's essential to grasp the core scenarios this page helps you with:

- **Accelerate individual test run times** to enhance developer productivity.
- **Utilize parallelism** to split tests across CPUs or machines.
- **Partition lagging test suites** so they run in smaller, faster chunks.
- **Tune your infrastructure** for large test suites and multiple test shards.

<Check>
**Prerequisites:**
- You have a GoogleTest test suite written and successfully running.
- Your build and test environment supports parallel execution (multi-core or distributed).
- Familiarity with executing tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and command-line flags.
</Check>

<Info>
**Expected Outcome:**
- Faster test execution.
- Efficient use of available computational resources.
- Reliable test results with easier identification of slow areas.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.

## 2. Step-by-Step Performance Optimization Workflow

### Step 1: Measure Current Test Performance

Identify which tests or test suites are the slowest. Use tools or logs that report test timings, including XML outputs from GoogleTest or external profiling.

**Action:**
- Run your tests normally with timing output enabled. For example:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

- Analyze the XML report to find tests with the longest durations.

**Outcome:**
- A prioritized list of slow test suites or tests.


### Step 2: Enable Parallel Test Execution

GoogleTest supports running tests in parallel shards by dividing the tests across multiple runners.

**How it works:**
- Use environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to divide tests across multiple processes or machines.

**Example:**

```shell
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0  # On machine 1
./my_test

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1  # On machine 2
./my_test
...
```

Each shard runs a disjoint subset of tests, enabling horizontal scaling.

**Tips:**
- Make sure your tests are independent to avoid conflicts.
- Automate shard dispatch with your CI system for full parallel coverage.


### Step 3: Partition Large Test Suites

If individual test suites take too long, break them into smaller suites, either manually or via parameterized tests.

**Approach:**
- Use **Value-Parameterized Tests** (`TEST_P`) to create smaller subsets.
- Distribute these parameterized tests across shards.

**Example:**

```c++
class LargeSuiteTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(LargeSuiteTest, SubTest) {
  int param = GetParam();
  // test code using param
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    PartitionedTests, LargeSuiteTest,
    testing::Range(0, 10));
```

This partitions a large logic zone into 10 chunks, each manageable for parallel runs.


### Step 4: Tune Test Infrastructure for Reliability and Speed

For very large-scale setups, optimize the environment:

- **Resource allocation:** Assign appropriate CPU, memory, and disk
- **Stabilize environment:** Use deterministic seeds (`--gtest_random_seed`) to prevent flakiness.
- **Use test sharding awareness:** Your test runner and environment should respect GoogleTest's shard protocol.

**Example:**

- Set explicit random seed across shards to reproduce failures:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_random_seed=12345
```

- Recreate test environments only when needed with:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_recreate_environments_when_repeating=true
```


### Step 5: Validate and Iterate

After applying parallelism and partitioning, re-measure test durations and stability. 

If bottlenecks remain, consider more partitioning or mock usage (see related guides).

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example: Shard in a 3-Machine Setup

```shell
# Machine 0
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./my_test

# Machine 1
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./my_test

# Machine 2
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2
./my_test
```

### Example: Run Tests with Shuffling and Repeat

To expose flaky tests faster:

```shell
./my_test --gtest_shuffle --gtest_repeat=100
```

### Example: Distribute Parameterized Tests

```c++
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyParams, LargeSuiteTest,
                         testing::ValuesIn(my_large_test_params));
```

Run these with sharding flags to distribute workload.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Are Not Running on All Shards">
Verify that both `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` are set correctly.
Ensure `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` is zero-based and less than `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Output Is Incomplete or Missing When Sharding">
Confirm that your test runner collects and merges results from all shards.
Enable XML output to facilitate aggregation: `--gtest_output=xml`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow or Flaky Tests Persist Despite Partitioning">
Identify flaky tests with repeated runs and random seeds.
Review test dependencies and isolate side effects.
Consider mocking expensive external dependencies.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Failures Involving Shared Resources">
Use test fixtures with `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` to reset shared state.
Avoid global mutable state unless carefully synchronized.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
To maximize parallel efficiency, design tests with minimal external dependencies and avoid global state or side effects.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop tests on first failure when debugging performance issues.
</Tip>
