# Common Test Organization Patterns

Explore popular patterns for organizing and scaling your test codebase to enhance maintainability and team productivity. This guide focuses on practical approaches such as fixture reuse, test parameterization, and advanced mocking setup to help you write cleaner, more efficient tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

---

## 1. Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
This guide helps you structure your test suites effectively as your codebase grows. It presents patterns that improve test clarity, reduce duplication, and facilitate comprehensive coverage through parameterization and advanced mocking techniques.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with GoogleTest basics and writing simple test cases.
- Basic understanding of GoogleMock, including creating mock classes and setting expectations.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Reuse test fixtures efficiently across multiple tests.
- Implement parameterized tests to avoid repetitive code.
- Apply advanced mocking patterns to manage complex test dependencies.
- Organize tests in a way that scales gracefully with your project.

### Time Estimate
Allow around 20-30 minutes to read through and experiment with the examples.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## 2. Test Fixture Reuse

### Why Reuse Fixtures?
Reusing fixtures helps avoid duplication by allowing shared setup and teardown code across related tests. This streamlines your test codebase and reduces the chance of errors in repeated initialization.

### How to Reuse Fixtures
1. Define a test fixture class deriving from `::testing::Test`.
2. Put common setup logic in `SetUp()` and cleanup logic in `TearDown()`.
3. Use your fixture in multiple test cases via `TEST_F`.

#### Example:
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanInsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Insert("record1"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanDeleteRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Delete("record1"));
}
```

### Best Practices
- Keep the setup minimal and relevant to the related test group.
- Avoid heavy or slow setup in frequently used fixtures unless necessary.
- Use inheritance or composition to share setup among fixture classes if needed.

## 3. Test Parameterization

### Why Parameterize Tests?
Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test code with different inputs, reducing code duplication and improving coverage.

### Implementing Parameterized Tests
GoogleTest supports parameterized tests using `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` macros.

### Step-by-step:
1. Create a test fixture class deriving from `::testing::TestWithParam<Type>`.
2. Write your test case using `TEST_P` instead of `TEST_F` or `TEST`.
3. Instantiate the test suite with a set of parameters using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

#### Example:
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<int, int>> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectFactorial) {
  int input = std::get<0>(GetParam());
  int expected = std::get<1>(GetParam());
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(input), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  Factorials,
  FactorialTest,
  ::testing::Values(
      std::make_tuple(0, 1),
      std::make_tuple(1, 1),
      std::make_tuple(2, 2),
      std::make_tuple(3, 6),
      std::make_tuple(4, 24)
  ));
```

### Tips
- Use `std::tuple` or custom structs for complex parameter sets.
- Utilize built-in generators like `Values`, `Range`, or combinators.
- Name your parameters clearly for better test report readability.

## 4. Mocking Setup Patterns

### Structuring Mock Objects
Mocks are essential for isolating units under test by simulating dependent components.

### Common Practices
- Define mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros in the `public` section.
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set expected interactions.
- Group related expectations for clarity.

### Advanced Setup - Delegating to Fakes or Real Objects
Sometimes you want a mock to delegate calls to a real or fake object. This preserves real behavior while allowing interaction verification.

#### Example: Delegating to a Fake
```cpp
class FakeFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  int Bar() override { return 42; }
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (), (override));

  MockFoo() {
    ON_CALL(*this, Bar()).WillByDefault([this]() { return fake_.Bar(); });
  }

 private:
  FakeFoo fake_;
};
```

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to mark methods `virtual` or add `override` in mocks.
- Setting expectations after exercising code causes undefined behavior.
- Over-specifying expectations leads to brittle tests. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors where possible.

### Best Practices
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls when strictness isn't desired.
- Use `StrictMock` when you want to enforce all interactions.
- Always set expectations before executing the code under test.
- Use chaining clauses (`Times`, `WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`, `InSequence`) thoughtfully to express intent clearly.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                                | Resolution                                                               |
| -------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mock methods not being called         | Ensure method is `virtual` in base class.                               |
| Unexpected calls warning              | Verify `EXPECT_CALL` covers all expected calls, or use `NiceMock`.      |
| Multiple warnings for failed expectations | Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace calls and expectation matching. |
| Calls not matching expectations       | Check argument matchers and call order; use sequences or `After`.        |
| Over-saturated expectations            | Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or adjust `Times()` to relax constraints.   |

<Tip>
To debug calls, run tests with the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call trace and matched expectations.

# Practical Checklist
- Always place `MOCK_METHOD` macros in the `public:` section of mock classes.
- Set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) before exercising code under test.
- Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors without enforcing call expectations.
- Prefer `NiceMock` to reduce noise, `StrictMock` to enforce strict call adherence.
- When expecting a sequence, use `InSequence` or `.InSequence()` clauses.

---

# Additional Tips
- Wrap complex return or argument types containing commas in parentheses or use type aliases with `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Use sequences (`::testing::Sequence`) and the `.After()` clause for specifying call order constraints.
- Leverage parameterized tests to run multiple cases with shared logic.
- Use `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()` to define consecutive mock method behaviors.
- Utilize `RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after their call count limit.

# Sample Workflow for Adding a Parameterized Mock Test

1. Define or identify the interface/class you want to mock.
2. Create a mock class with `MOCK_METHOD`s.
3. Define a test fixture inheriting from `::testing::TestWithParam<..>`.
4. Write `TEST_P` cases using parameter values.
5. Instantiate tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` and parameter sets.
6. Write `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` as needed in your test body.
7. Execute test and verify expectations and behaviors.
