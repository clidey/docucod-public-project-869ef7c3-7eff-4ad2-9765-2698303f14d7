# Improving Your Tests with Expressive Assertions

Elevate your tests with custom and rich assertions in GoogleTest. This guide helps you understand when and how to use, extend, and combine assertion macros for clearer test intent and actionable failure messages, making debugging faster and your tests more expressive.

---

## Workflow Overview

**What this guide helps you accomplish:**

This guide teaches you how to leverage GoogleTest's expressive assertions to write tests that communicate intent clearly and provide detailed failure diagnostics.

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest usage and writing simple assertions.
- A working C++ project integrated with GoogleTest.

**Expected Outcome:**

- You will be able to write custom assertions for complex conditions.
- Understand predicate and predicate-format assertions.
- Combine existing assertions and create rich failure messages.
- Use expressive matchers to verify detailed expectations.

**Time Estimate:**

Approximately 30-45 minutes to read and apply the concepts.

**Difficulty Level:**

Intermediate – assumes basic knowledge of GoogleTest.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Expressive Assertions

### 1. Understanding the Need for Expressive Assertions

Standard assertions like `EXPECT_TRUE()` can check conditions but often give opaque failure messages that don’t directly explain why your test failed. Expressive assertions improve on this by showing detailed context and custom error messages.

### 2. Use Predicate Assertions for Complex Conditions

When a standard assertion is insufficient, such as checking a complex Boolean expression, use predicate assertions:

- **`EXPECT_PRED*` Macros:** Use existing Boolean functions with 1 to 5 arguments to get automatic printing of arguments on failure.

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return (n % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

- **Custom Predicate with AssertionResult:** Write a predicate that returns `testing::AssertionResult` for richer messages.

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(value));
```

Failed failures show `'actual: false (3 is odd)'` instead of just `false`.

### 3. Use Predicate-Formatter Assertions for Full Control

To craft highly customized error messages, implement predicate-formatter functions that take argument expressions as strings alongside their values:

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult AssertIsEven(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " evaluates to " << n << ", which is not even.";
}

EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(AssertIsEven, value);
```

This outputs detailed assertion failure including the expression text.

### 4. Using Rich GoogleMock Matchers with `EXPECT_THAT`

GoogleTest supports the `EXPECT_THAT` macro to verify values against flexible matchers from GoogleMock:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;

EXPECT_THAT(str, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(path, MatchesRegex("/usr/.*"));
```

Matchers provide readable failure messages explaining what matched and why.

### 5. Extended String Assertions

These include:

- **`EXPECT_STREQ` / `ASSERT_STREQ`** for C strings by contents.
- **`EXPECT_STRCASEEQ` / `ASSERT_STRCASEEQ`** for case-insensitive comparisons.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ("hello", c_str_var);
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ("FOO", c_str_var);  // compares ignoring case
```

### 6. Floating-Point Assertions

Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, and `EXPECT_NEAR` to compare floating-point values approximately, accounting for rounding errors and precision limits.

```cpp
EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(0.1f + 0.2f, 0.3f);
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated, expected, 0.001);
```

### 7. Exception Assertions

Verify that code throws or does not throw exceptions with:

- `EXPECT_THROW` / `ASSERT_THROW`
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW`
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW`

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionUnderTest(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(FunctionUnderTest());
```

### 8. Advanced Assertion Placement and Propagation

- Use only non-fatal assertions in non-void returning functions.
- For fatal assertions that should abort the current test, place them inside void-returning functions, fixtures, or test bodies.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual trace information in nested subroutines for easier debugging.

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Checking index " << i);
EXPECT_EQ(array[i], expected);
```

### 9. Logging Additional Test Properties

Use `RecordProperty(key, value)` to annotate tests with custom metadata, which can be output in XML or JSON test reports.

```cpp
RecordProperty("MaxMemory", 1024);
```

### 10. Tips for Maximizing Assertion Power

- Write custom matchers using the `MATCHER` and `MATCHER_P` macros to describe complex matching logic with clear error messages.
- Prefer `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers to simple boolean checks to get better diagnostics.
- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT` for validators that require detailed explanations.
- Combine matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` for flexible conditions.

## Examples & Code Samples

### Custom Predicate Returning AssertionResult

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess() << n << " is even";
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(NumberTest, EvenCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4));  // Passes
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(3));  // Fails with message: "3 is odd"
}
```

### Using `EXPECT_THAT` with Matchers

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::HasSubstr;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;

TEST(StringTest, Matching) {
  std::string text = "foo bar baz";
  EXPECT_THAT(text, HasSubstr("bar"));
  EXPECT_THAT(text, MatchesRegex("^foo.*baz$"));
}
```

### Combining Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
EXPECT_THAT(value, AnyOf(Eq(2), Eq(4), Eq(6)));
EXPECT_THAT(value, Not(Eq(3)));
```

### Scoped Trace Example

```cpp
void CheckElements(const std::vector<int>& v) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    SCOPED_TRACE("element " << i);
    EXPECT_GT(v[i], 0);
  }
}
```

If test fails on element at index 2, output includes trace:

```
stem.cc:23: Failure
Value of: v[i]
Expected: > 0
  Actual: 0
Google Test trace:
stem.cc:20: element 2
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Opaque failure messages:** Use predicate assertions returning `AssertionResult` or `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers instead of raw `EXPECT_TRUE`.
- **Complex expressions in `EXPECT_TRUE`:** Refactor them into predicates or use predicate-format assertions.
- **Assertion failures without context:** Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context.
- **Fatal assertions in non-void functions cause compile errors:** Only use non-fatal `EXPECT_*` macros or refactor the function to return `void`.

### Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_THAT` and matchers for readability and better diagnostics.
- Write custom matchers for reusable, descriptive assertions.
- Prefer `AssertionResult` returning predicates to custom fail messages inside simple assertions.

### Performance Consideration

- Matching complex data structures with matchers like `ElementsAre` or custom matchers is more efficient than streaming large messages for failures.
