# Organizing and Scaling Your Test Suite

## Overview

As your project grows, the test suite naturally expands in size and complexity. This page guides you through practical methods to structure, organize, and maintain large test suites effectively. Applying these strategies will preserve test readability, improve execution efficiency, and simplify maintenance.

---

## 1. Structuring Your Test Suite

### 1.1 Test Discovery and Automatic Registration

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests defined via the `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and related macros. This means:

- Tests are self-registering; explicit enumeration is unnecessary.
- New tests are automatically recognized without modification to test runners.

**Best Practice:** Adopt a coherent naming scheme and directory layout to help humans navigate your growing suite effectively.

---

### 1.2 Grouping Tests into Suites

Tests are grouped into **Test Suites** using the first argument of `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`. Grouping related tests into suites has multiple benefits:

- **Logical organization:** Suites map to modules, classes, or features.
- **Shared setup/teardown:** Use test fixtures (`TEST_F()`) to factor common initialization.
- **Selective execution:** Run or filter suites independently.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathUtilsTests, FactorialTest) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}

class StringUtilsTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // common fixture setup
  }
};

TEST_F(StringUtilsTest, IsEmptyReturnsTrueForEmptyString) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEmpty(""));
}
```

---

### 1.3 Naming Conventions

Adopt clear, consistent naming conventions across your test suites and test cases:

- Use descriptive test suite names that correspond to functional areas, classes, or components.
- Name individual tests to clearly describe what they verify, avoiding abbreviations.
- Avoid underscores (`_`) or special characters per Google C++ style recommendations.

This helps when you use filters for selective test runs.

---

## 2. Managing Test Dependencies and Resource Sharing

### 2.1 Using Test Fixtures

Test fixtures encapsulate commonly used objects and setup code:

- Share setup and teardown across tests.
- Keep tests clean and eliminate duplication.

Always create minimal but sufficient fixtures, avoiding introducing unrelated dependencies that slow tests.

### 2.2 Controlling Test Execution Order

While GoogleTest does not guarantee test execution order, you can use test dependencies sparingly:

- Refactor tests to be independent whenever possible.
- If order is essential (integration or system tests), consider explicit sequencing using test suites or custom runners.

### 2.3 Parallel and Distributed Execution

For large test suites, consider:

- Running tests concurrently (supported by GoogleTest) to reduce wall-clock time.
- Sharding tests across machines or processes.

Ensure no shared global state or resource conflicts to avoid flakiness.

---

## 3. Organizing Test Source Files

### 3.1 Directory Layout

Keep tests organized on disk using folder structures that mirror the production code, for example:

```
project_root/
  src/
    math_utils/
    string_utils/
  tests/
    math_utils/
    string_utils/
```

This makes it easier for developers to find and maintain related tests.

### 3.2 Mock Classes and Helpers

Place mock classes near the interfaces they mock, ideally in separate test-only subdirectories:

- Use header files suffixed with `_mock.h` for mocks.
- Isolate test-only helpers to reduce dependencies for production builds.

Example:
```
tests/mocks/mock_turtle.h
```

### 3.3 Test Data and Fixtures

Store test data files (e.g., sample inputs, golden outputs) in organized directories, such as `tests/testdata/`.

Be sure to handle paths portably.

---

## 4. Maintaining Efficiency and Readability

### 4.1 Minimizing Test Duration

Long-running tests hinder rapid feedback. Consider:

- Splitting slow tests into their own suite.
- Using mocks or fakes to isolate code and speed up execution.
- Using GoogleMock for interaction verification as a lightweight substitute for integration tests.

### 4.2 Avoiding Brittle Tests

Tests that are sensitive to internal implementation detail or overly strict mocks become brittle:

- Avoid excessive use of strict expectations.
- Use `NiceMock` or `NaggyMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls.
- Specify only essential call constraints.

### 4.3 Documenting Tests

Encourage documentation within tests:

- Use descriptive test names.
- Add comments explaining the rationale and edge cases where helpful.

This supports long-term upkeep and knowledge transfer.

---

## 5. Filtering and Running Tests

### 5.1 Using Filters

Use GoogleTest’s test filter flag to run specific suites or tests during development:

```sh
--gtest_filter=MathUtilsTests.*
```

Filters support wildcards for flexible selection.

### 5.2 Grouping Tests with Labels or Tags

GoogleTest supports test properties and labels to mark tests by characteristics such as `slow`, `integration`, `smoke`.

Use these to include or exclude tests in different testing stages.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

### 6.1 Undiscovered or Unrun Tests

- Ensure test suites and tests use proper macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc).
- Check for naming violations, especially underscores.
- Confirm tests are linked and built into the test binary.

### 6.2 Slow Tests and Dependency Bottlenecks

- Profile test runtime.
- Isolate and mock slow dependencies.

### 6.3 Test Pollution

- Avoid global static variables or states shared across tests.
- Clean up after tests.

### 6.4 Mocking and Expectations

Refer to the [Mocking Basics Guide](/guides/core-workflows/mocking-basics) and [gMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for advanced mocking scenarios.

## Summary
Maintaining a large test suite requires thoughtful structuring, effective grouping using test suites and fixtures, consistent naming conventions, and practical organization of source files and mocks. Efficiency is preserved by controlling test dependencies, embracing parallelism, and avoiding brittle tests. GoogleTest’s automatic test discovery and powerful filtering capabilities enable scalable test management. Adhering to these best practices ensures your tests remain readable, maintainable, and performant as the codebase and team grow.

## Example: Defining and Grouping Tests
```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator = new Calculator();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    delete calculator;
  }

  Calculator* calculator;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AdditionWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator->Add(1, 2), 3);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, DivisionByZeroThrows) {
  EXPECT_THROW(calculator->Divide(5, 0), std::runtime_error);
}
```

Run these tests with filter:
```sh
./test_binary --gtest_filter=CalculatorTest.*
```

---

## Tips
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls for large mocks.
- Use test parameters and `TEST_P` for data-driven tests.
- Organize mocking classes near corresponding interfaces.
- Use verbose mode (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to debug expectation mismatches.
