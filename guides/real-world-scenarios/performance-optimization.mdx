# Optimizing Test Performance

## Overview

Large C++ test suites can easily grow slow and unwieldy if not carefully managed. This guide helps you keep your tests fast and efficient by adopting best practices and leveraging tools designed for scalable test execution.

You will learn techniques for running tests in parallel, selectively executing only relevant tests, reducing costly setup and teardown phases, and diagnosing performance bottlenecks.

## Prerequisites

- A working installation of GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Familiarity with writing basic tests using GoogleTest.
- Access to your build and test environment.
- Optionally, familiarity with test running tools like `gtest-parallel` if parallel execution is desired.

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:
- Run your test suite faster by parallelizing execution.
- Save time by running only impacted or selected tests.
- Reduce overhead of costly test fixtures through efficient design.
- Identify slow tests and troubleshoot performance problems.

## Time Estimate

Initial setup and learning: 30-60 minutes
Continuous usage and optimization: ongoing

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate: requires understanding of test design and some tooling.

## 1. Running Tests in Parallel

Most test suites contain many independent tests that can run simultaneously. GoogleTest and related tools support parallel test execution to reduce total test time.

### Steps to Enable Parallel Execution

1. **Identify if your tests are thread-safe:**
  - Ensure no test shares state without synchronization.
  - Avoid global mutable state unless protected.

2. **Use `gtest-parallel`:**
  - Install `gtest-parallel` (a Python script to run GoogleTest tests in parallel).
  - Run your tests using `gtest-parallel` instead of `bazel test` or plain test binary.

    ```bash
    gtest-parallel path/to/your/test_binary
    ```

3. **Configure parallel job count:**
  - Use the `-j` argument to control how many test processes run at once, for example:

    ```bash
    gtest-parallel -j 8 path/to/your/test_binary
    ```

4. **Validate correctness:**
  - Run your tests under parallel execution to verify no race conditions or flaky failures.

### Expected Results
Tests should complete faster by utilizing multiple CPU cores, with no change in test outcomes.

### Tips
- Parallelizing tests can expose flaky tests.
- Consider adding locks or redesigning tests if failures due to shared state occur.

## 2. Running Selective Tests

Running all tests can be slow and sometimes unnecessary, especially when editing parts of your code.

### Techniques for Selective Execution

- **Use Test Filters:**
  - GoogleTest supports filtering tests by test suite or test name with the `--gtest_filter` flag.
  - Example: run only tests with name containing "Database":

    ```bash
    ./test_binary --gtest_filter=*Database*
    ```

- **Run Tests Affected by Your Code Change:**
  - Integrate with build systems or CI tools that detect changed files and run corresponding tests.
  - Use test runners that support running only impacted tests.

- **Divide Test Suites by Subsystems:**
  - Organize tests in logical groups and run them separately during development.

### Expected Outcome
- Quicker feedback cycles by focusing only on relevant tests.

### Advice
- Avoid over-filtering to keep regression coverage.
- Use filters consistently for development speed.

## 3. Minimizing Setup and Teardown Overhead

Costly test fixture setup and teardown can slow tests.

### Best Practices

1. **Reuse Fixtures When Possible:**
  - Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for expensive operations to share across multiple test cases.

2. **Use Lightweight Objects:**
  - Prefer lightweight mock and test classes that don't allocate large resources repeatedly.

3. **Isolate Expensive Resources:**
  - Mock or stub expensive services (databases, network) to avoid initialization costs.

4. **Reset State Without Recreate:**
  - Instead of destroying and recreating fixtures, clean and reset existing objects.

5. **Avoid Unnecessary Global Setup:**
  - Avoid global or static initializations that run even when tests don't require them.

### Expected Result
Lower per-test execution time due to reduced overhead.

### Pitfalls
- Don't share state between tests unless carefully managed.

## 4. Detecting and Troubleshooting Slow Tests

Even with parallel execution and selective running, a few slow tests can cause bottlenecks.

### Steps to Identify Slow Tests

1. **Enable Timing Output:**
  - Use GoogleTest's `--gtest_print_time` flag to print how long each test takes.

    ```bash
    ./test_binary --gtest_print_time
    ```

2. **Analyze Test Logs:**
  - Look for tests or suites with consistently high execution time.

3. **Profile Tests:**
  - Run slow tests under a profiler to identify hot spots.
  - Investigate test code and the underlying code.

4. **Use Test Filtering to Isolate Slow Tests:**
  - Run slow tests separately to verify their impact.

### Troubleshooting
- Check if slow setup can be optimized or mocked.
- Consider refactoring tests with heavy dependencies.
- Look for unnecessary IO, computation, or waits in the test.

## 5. Integration with Build and CI Environments

### Automate Parallel Runs
- Configure CI systems (e.g. Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to run tests in parallel using `gtest-parallel` or native parallel test execution features.

### Cache Test Results
- Implement test result caching and selective reruns based on change detection.

### Monitor Test Duration
- Setup alerting for tests exceeding baseline duration.

### Sample CI Snippet
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run tests in parallel
    run: |
      gtest-parallel -j $(nproc) ./path/to/test_binary
```

Examine if underlying services or resources are still being initialized.
Try mocking or faking slow dependencies.

## Summary

Optimizing large test suites takes continuous effort. Use parallel execution and selective testing to dramatically improve performance. Reduce setup/teardown costs and monitor tests to spot bottlenecks. Finally, integrate these practices into your build and CI pipelines for fastest feedback.

## Example: Running a subset of tests in parallel

```bash
# Run tests containing 'Network' in the name, with up to 4 parallel jobs
gtest-parallel -j 4 ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=*Network*
```

## Example: Defining fixture with shared setup

```cpp
class ExpensiveFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Initialization done once per test suite
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Cleanup once per test suite
  }
  void SetUp() override {
    // Lightweight per-test setup
  }
};
```

<Tip>
Make your tests deterministic to enable reliable parallel execution.
</Tip>

<Note>
Always run your entire test suite in the standard mode before integrating parallel execution to ensure no hidden dependencies.
