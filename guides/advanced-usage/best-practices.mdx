# Testing Best Practices

## Overview

As your software project grows, maintaining a clean and effective test suite becomes essential for reliable development and easier maintenance. This guide provides recommended patterns and strategies for structuring test code, choosing consistent naming conventions, managing test fixtures, and writing maintainable, readable tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock frameworks.

By adopting these best practices, you can reduce test brittleness, improve readability, and facilitate collaboration across teams.

## Structuring Test Code

Organizing your tests logically promotes clarity and maintainability. Here are key patterns to follow:

### 1. Group Tests by Functionality or Component

Keep tests close to the code they verify:

- Create separate test files per class or feature, e.g., `widget_test.cc` for the `Widget` class.
- Organize test files in directories mirroring the production source tree.

This improves discoverability and makes it easier to locate tests for a given component.

### 2. Organize Tests Within Files Using `TEST` and `TEST_F`

- Use `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` for simple, stateless tests.
- Use `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` when tests require shared setup or to reuse expensive state.

Group related tests under the same test suite or fixture to emphasize their relation.

### 3. Sequence Your Test Cases Logically

When possible, arrange tests to flow naturally, e.g., from simplest behavior to edge cases.

### 4. Keep Test Code DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

Extract recurring setup code, helper functions, or test utilities into:

- Test fixtures
- Utility classes or helper functions within the test namespace
- Custom matchers or actions (as per gMock Cookbook)

This reduces boilerplate and eases maintenance.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent and descriptive naming is vital to understand what your tests do at a glance.

### 1. Test Suites / Fixtures

- Name test suites or fixtures after the class or module they test.
- Use clear, concise names, e.g., `DatabaseConnectionTest`, `HttpRequestParserTest`.

### 2. Test Cases

- Write test case names as descriptive action or behavior phrases.
- Prefer names that describe **what** is tested and **under what condition**.

**Examples:**

```cpp
TEST(WidgetTest, InitializesWithDefaultValues);
TEST_F(DatabaseConnectionTest, FailsToConnectWithInvalidCredentials);
TEST_F(HttpRequestParserTest, ParsesHeadersCorrectly);
```

### 3. Use Common Suffixes or Prefixes

- For failure cases, consider suffixes like `FailsWithInvalidInput`.
- For expected successes, names could be simple or prefixed with `Succeeds` or `Returns`.

### 4. Avoid Redundancy

Since test suite names describe the context, avoid repeating it in test case names.

**Prefer:**

```cpp
TEST(WidgetTest, ResetsState);
```

**Avoid:**

```cpp
TEST(WidgetTest, WidgetResetsState);
```

### 5. Follow C++ Identifier Rules

Use consistent casing (CamelCase or snake_case) that matches your project's style.

## Managing Test Fixtures

Test fixtures enable sharing common setup and teardown code for a group of tests.

### 1. Use Fixtures for Expensive or Repeated Setup

For instances or state needed by multiple tests, use `TEST_F` with a fixture class:

```cpp
class FileParserTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    parser_.LoadConfig("test_config.txt");
  }

  FileParser parser_;
};

TEST_F(FileParserTest, ParsesLinesCorrectly) {
  ...
}
```

### 2. Keep Setup & Teardown Lightweight

Avoid loading large resources or performing expensive operations if only a few tests need them.
Use separate fixtures or helper functions when needed.

### 3. Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for Expensive Shared Setup

If all tests in a test suite require heavy initialization, use static fixture methods to do it once per suite.

### 4. Avoid Shared Mutable State Across Tests

Tests must be independent and repeatable.
Any shared state should be carefully initialized/reset to avoid cross-test interference.

### 5. Use Helper Functions Within Fixture Classes

Avoid duplicating verification or setup logic by defining helper functions:

```cpp
class NetworkTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void ExpectDefaultSetup() {
    EXPECT_TRUE(connection_.IsInitialized());
  }

  NetworkConnection connection_;
};
```

## Writing Readable and Maintainable Tests

Readable tests are integral to sustainable software quality. Use these techniques:

### 1. Write One Assertion Per Test Where Possible

Focus each test on verifying a single concept or behavior. This simplifies diagnosing failures.

### 2. Use Descriptive Expectations and Matchers

Prefer expressive matchers and custom matchers (see gMock Cookbook) to make failures meaningful.

### 3. Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` Appropriately

- Use `NiceMock` when uninteresting calls should be ignored to reduce noisy warnings.
- Use `NaggyMock` (default) when warnings on uninteresting calls are desirable.
- Use `StrictMock` to treat unexpected calls as errors, enforcing strict call discipline.

### 4. Avoid Over-Specifying Expectations

Do not specify more than necessary about argument values or call count, unless the test requires it.

### 5. Name Your Test Fixtures and Test Cases to Reflect Intent

Follow the naming conventions to make test purposes instantly understandable.

### 6. Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for Parameterized Tests

Write concise tests that cover multiple input values without duplication.

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  ValidInputs,
  MyTest,
  ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

### 7. Comment Non-Obvious Test Logic

Briefly explain why a test exists or why a certain expectation applies, especially for complicated test setups.

### 8. Regularly Refactor Tests

Keep tests clean and up to date with code changes to avoid brittle or obsolete tests.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                              | Solution / Best Practice                                               |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mock methods without `EXPECT_CALL` | Use `NiceMock` or set up `ON_CALL` appropriately to suppress unwanted warnings. |
| Overly brittle tests                | Use looser matchers like `_` when argument values are irrelevant.      |
| Test dependencies                  | Isolate tests to avoid shared mutable state or setup failures affecting others. |
| Expectation order errors            | Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses to enforce proper order when required. |
| Forgotten `virtual` destructors    | Ensure all base classes being mocked or inherited have virtual destructors. |
| Naming ambiguity                   | Adopt and document clear naming conventions for suites and tests.     |

## Troubleshooting Suggestions

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logs about expectations and mock calls.
- Use heap checkers or tools to detect leaked mocks, which might prevent test verification.
- Ensure that your mocks have virtual destructors to avoid resource leaks and undefined behavior.
- If you see warnings about uninteresting calls, review your test to add expectations or consider switching to `NiceMock`.
- Remember not to change expectations after exercises to avoid undefined behavior.
