# Writing Your First Test

## Overview

This guide provides a practical introduction to creating and running your first unit test using GoogleTest. Learn how to structure a basic test case, use assertions to verify code behavior, and execute tests with typical development tools. By following this guide, you will gain hands-on experience with the essential workflow of writing and validating your initial test.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting with your first test, ensure that:

- GoogleTest is installed and properly integrated in your development environment.
- You are familiar with basic C++ syntax and compilation.
- Your project is set up to link against the GoogleTest libraries.

If you need help setting up, see [Installing GoogleTest (CMake & Bazel)](/getting-started/prep-requirements-installation/install-cmake-bazel) and [Project Setup & Integration](/getting-started/configuring-using-tests/project-setup-integration).

---

## Expected Outcome

By completing this guide, you will have:

- A minimal test case compiled into an executable.
- Executed the test and interpreted results.
- Understood the anatomy of a GoogleTest test case.
- Gained confidence to write additional and more complex tests.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Test File"> 
Create a new C++ source file, e.g., `my_first_test.cc`, in your project directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Include GoogleTest Headers">
Add the necessary headers to use GoogleTest features:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```
</Step>

<Step title="Write a Simple Test Case">
Define a test case using the `TEST` macro. It takes two arguments: the test suite name and the test name.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(SampleTest, Addition) {
  int sum = 2 + 2;
  EXPECT_EQ(sum, 4);  // Assert that sum equals 4
}
```

This defines a test called `Addition` inside the `SampleTest` suite that verifies if 2 + 2 equals 4.
</Step>

<Step title="Build the Test Executable">
Compile your test file with GoogleTest linked. For example, using `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -isystem path/to/googletest/include -pthread my_first_test.cc path/to/libgtest.a -o my_first_test
```

Refer to your build system (CMake, Bazel, etc.) documentation to configure builds properly.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Test">
Execute the generated binary from the command line:

```bash
./my_first_test
```

You should see output indicating that the test passed, similar to:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.Addition
[       OK ] SampleTest.Addition (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from SampleTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Test Results">
- **PASSED:** The test succeeded.
- **FAILED:** The test did not meet an expectation, and output will contain error details.

Example failure message for wrong assertion:

```
my_first_test.cc:5: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
sum
  Which is: 5
4
```

Use this information to debug your code or test.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Name your tests clearly:** Use descriptive suite and test names to convey the intent.
- **Keep tests small and focused:** Each test should verify a single behavior.
- **Use assertions wisely:** `EXPECT_` macros allow test continuation; `ASSERT_` macros abort on failure.
- **Build and run frequently:** Verify your tests build and run correctly as you develop.
- **Explore more assertions:** Beyond `EXPECT_EQ`, learn variants like `EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_THROW`, etc.
- **Read test output carefully:** GoogleTest provides detailed info on failures including file, line number, and values.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues Running Your First Test">
<Accordion title="Test Does Not Compile">
Ensure you've included `<gtest/gtest.h>` and linked against the GoogleTest library correctly.
Check for typos in your macro usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Binary Executes But No Tests Run">
Make sure your test cases are defined with the `TEST` macro.
Verify the test executable is built correctly.
Check command-line parameters that may disable tests.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Fails Unexpectedly">
Read the failure message and check assertion expressions.
Check data values used in your test.
Use `--gtest_verbose=info` to get more detailed test logs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GoogleTest Not Found On Include Path">
Verify your project setup includes GoogleTest include directories.
If using CMake or Bazel, add appropriate `target_include_directories` or dependencies.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

- Explore [Understanding Assertions and Best Practices](/guides/core-testing-workflows/assertions-best-practices) to write more effective tests.
- Get started with mocks using [Getting Started with Mocks](/guides/mocking-and-advanced-scenarios/mocking-basics).
- Deepen knowledge about organizing and running multiple tests at [Organizing and Running Test Suites](/guides/core-testing-workflows/organizing-and-running-tests).

## Example Code Snippet

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// This is a simple test case.
TEST(SampleTest, Addition) {
  int sum = 2 + 2;
  EXPECT_EQ(sum, 4);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This minimal code defines one test and executes it when the program runs.

---

<Tip>
Running your tests frequently and giving your test cases clear, descriptive names will make test development and debugging much easier and more efficient.
</Tip>

<Note>
Always write `EXPECT_CALL()` or `ON_CALL()` *before* exercising mock objects to avoid undefined behavior (see [gMock for Dummies](docs/gmock_for_dummies.md#using-mocks-in-tests) for more).
</Note>
