# Using Assertions Effectively

## Overview
This guide provides an in-depth look at GoogleTest's rich set of assertion macros and techniques. You will learn how to pick the right assertion for your test scenarios, from simple Boolean checks and comparisons to advanced predicates and exception assertions. The goal is to help you write clear, expressive, and maintainable tests that precisely and informatively verify your code’s behavior.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Types and Selection

GoogleTest assertions are the primary way to verify that your code behaves as expected. Choosing the right assertion impacts the readability of your tests and the clarity of failure messages.

### Assertion Behavior: EXPECT_ vs. ASSERT_
- `EXPECT_*`: Generates a **nonfatal failure**. Test execution continues after the assertion.
- `ASSERT_*`: Generates a **fatal failure** and aborts the current function immediately.

Use `EXPECT_*` when the test can sensibly continue after failure to reveal additional issues, and `ASSERT_*` when continuing on failure is meaningless or unsafe.

### Categories of Assertions
- **Boolean Assertions:** Check simple conditions with `EXPECT_TRUE()`, `EXPECT_FALSE()`, and their assert counterparts.
- **Binary Comparisons:** Use `EXPECT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NE()`, `EXPECT_LT()`, etc., for two-value relational checks.
- **String Comparisons:** For C strings, use `EXPECT_STREQ()`, `EXPECT_STRNE()`, and their case-insensitive variants.
- **Floating Point Comparisons:** Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ()`, or `EXPECT_NEAR()` to compare floating-point values considering precision issues.
- **Exception Assertions:** Verify that your code throws or does not throw exceptions with `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW()`, and `EXPECT_ANY_THROW()`.
- **Predicate Assertions:** For complex or custom conditions, use `EXPECT_PRED*()` or `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*()` macros.
- **Matcher-Based Assertions:** Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with gMock matchers for expressive and readable conditions involving complex objects or conditions.


## 2. Writing Expressive Assertions

### 2.1 Boolean Conditions
Check that a condition is true or false:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Validation failed";
ASSERT_FALSE(has_error) << "Unexpected error occurred";
```

### 2.2 Binary Comparisons
Ideal for value equality or relational checks:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected) << "Values differ";
ASSERT_LT(value, limit) << "Value exceeds limit";
```

**Tip:**
- Use `EXPECT_STR*()` for C strings instead of `EXPECT_EQ()` which compares pointers.
- Order your expressions as `EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected)` to align with failure messages.

### 2.3 String Comparison Variants
- Exact content equality: `EXPECT_STREQ(a, b)`
- Not equal: `EXPECT_STRNE(a, b)`
- Case-insensitive equal: `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(a, b)`
- Case-insensitive not equal: `EXPECT_STRCASENE(a, b)`

```cpp
const char* s1 = "Hello";
const char* s2 = "hello";
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(s1, s2);
```

### 2.4 Floating-Point Assertions
Floating point numbers should be compared with tolerance:

```cpp
EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(f1, f2);       // For float
ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(d1, d2);     // For double
EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, epsilon);  // Custom error margin
```

---

## 3. Advanced Assertion Techniques

### 3.1 Predicate Assertions
When simple binary assertions or `EXPECT_TRUE` are insufficient to produce clear failure messages, use predicate assertions.

- `EXPECT_PRED1(predicate, val1)` through `EXPECT_PRED5(predicate, val1, ..., val5)`
- The `predicate` is a function or functor returning `bool`.

Example:

```cpp
// Checks if two integers are mutually prime
bool MutuallyPrime(int a, int b);

EXPECT_PRED2(MutuallyPrime, val1, val2);
```

If the assertion fails, you get values printed with the failure for diagnostic clarity.

### 3.2 Predicate-Formatter Assertions
For fully customized failure messages, use:

- `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(pred_formatter, val1)` through `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT5(...)`

`pred_formatter` is a function/functor returning `testing::AssertionResult`, which indicates success or failure and streams a custom message.

Example:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult AssertMutuallyPrime(const char* expr1, const char* expr2, int a, int b) {
  if (MutuallyPrime(a, b)) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr1 << " and " << expr2 << " are not mutually prime";
}

EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(AssertMutuallyPrime, val1, val2);
```

This prints detailed failure messages including argument expressions and values.

### 3.3 Using gMock Matchers with `EXPECT_THAT`
Matchers provide an expressive way to state expectations, and are especially useful with complex objects or container checks.

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;

EXPECT_THAT(str, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(code, MatchesRegex("\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}"));
```

Matchers yield readable failure messages, improving debugging efficiency.

## 4. Structuring Assertions for Readability and Debugging

### 4.1 Adding Custom Failure Messages
You can append informative messages to any assertion to clarify failure context:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Expected result to equal the expected value";
```

### 4.2 Avoiding Multiple Evaluations
All GoogleTest assertions evaluate their arguments **exactly once**, making them safe against side effects or expensive operations.

### 4.3 Using `SCOPED_TRACE` for Context in Helper Functions
When assertions occur in helper functions called multiple times, differentiate failures using `SCOPED_TRACE`:

```cpp
void Helper(int n) {
  SCOPED_TRACE(::testing::Message() << "In Helper with n=" << n);
  EXPECT_EQ(Compute(n), expected_value);
}

TEST(Foo, Bar) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    Helper(i);
  }
}
```

Failure messages will include trace points to indicate which call failed.

### 4.4 Propagating Fatal Failures from Subroutines
Since `ASSERT_*` abort only the current function, use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or check `HasFatalFailure()`:

```cpp
void Subroutine() {
  ASSERT_EQ(x, y);  // aborts only Subroutine().
}

TEST(FooTest, Main) {
  Subroutine();
  if (HasFatalFailure()) return;  // Prevent further code on failure.
  ...
}
```

Or set up a test event listener that throws exceptions on fatal failures for alternative control flow.

## 5. Practical Examples

### 5.1 Basic Equality Check with Custom Message
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  int sum = Add(2, 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(sum, 5) << "Sum did not match expected value.";
}
```

### 5.2 Using Predicate Assertion for Complex Condition
```cpp
bool IsPrime(int n);  // returns true if n is a prime

TEST(NumberTest, ChecksPrime) {
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsPrime, 17);  // Will print argument if assertion fails
}
```

### 5.3 Custom Predicate-Formatter for Detailed Message
```cpp
testing::AssertionResult AssertIsEven(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " (" << n << ") is odd";
}

TEST(MyTest, EvenCheck) {
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(AssertIsEven, 3);  // Prints explanatory message on failure
}
```

### 5.4 Using gMock Matcher for String Checking
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::HasSubstr;

TEST(StringTest, ContainsSubstr) {
  std::string text = "Hello, world!";
  EXPECT_THAT(text, HasSubstr("world"));
}
```

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Prefer specific comparison assertions like `EXPECT_EQ` over generic ones like `EXPECT_TRUE(x == y)` for better failure diagnostics.
- Use `ASSERT_*` if subsequent test code depends on the success of the assertion.
- For floating-point numbers, never use `EXPECT_EQ`; use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR` instead.
- Add meaningful messages with `<<` to clarify context in complex tests.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context from nested helper calls.
- Write custom predicates or predicate-formatters for assertions that cannot be expressed simply.
- Utilize `EXPECT_THAT` with gMock matchers for expressive, readable assertions on complex or container objects.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

### Problem: Test Continues After Fatal `ASSERT_*` Failure
Remember that `ASSERT_*` aborts only the current function, not the entire test. To stop test execution after failure in a helper function, use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or check `HasFatalFailure()`.

### Problem: C String Comparisons Fail Unexpectedly
`EXPECT_EQ` compares pointer addresses for C strings. Use `EXPECT_STREQ` to compare string contents.

### Problem: Floating-point Values Fail Equality Checks
Use floating-point-aware assertions like `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR` to avoid precision issues.

### Problem: Assertion Messages Are Hard to Understand
Add custom failure messages via streaming with `<<` or write predicate-formatters to create detailed messages.

### Problem: Overloaded or Template Functions Don’t Work with Predicate Assertions
Explicitly cast the function pointer to the expected signature.

```cpp
EXPECT_PRED1(static_cast<bool(*)(int)>(IsPositive), 5);
```
