# Using Assertions Effectively

Harness the full power of GoogleTest assertions to create clear, concise, and robust test validations. This guide walks you through the diverse categories of assertions, helping you select the most appropriate one for your test scenarios, craft expressive failure messages, and apply user-defined assertions to enhance clarity and maintainability.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Types and Their Use Cases

Before diving into code, it's vital to recognize the variety of assertions GoogleTest offers and why each matters:

- **Nonfatal vs Fatal Assertions:**
  - **`EXPECT_` assertions** produce nonfatal failures, allowing the test function to continue after failure.
  - **`ASSERT_` assertions** produce fatal failures, aborting the current test function immediately.

Choosing between these boils down to your need to proceed after a failure or to abort early.

### Key Assertion Categories

| Category | Description | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Boolean Conditions (`EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_FALSE`) | Verify a condition’s truth or falsity. | When the outcome is a simple logical condition. |
| Binary Comparisons (`EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, etc.) | Compare two values using standard operators. | When testing for equality/inequality or ordering of values. |
| String Comparisons (`EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, etc.) | Compare C-style string contents, including ignoring case. | When comparing null-terminated strings for exact value. |
| Floating-Point Comparisons (`EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`) | Check approximate equality within acceptable error bounds. | Use for floating-point numbers to avoid pitfalls of rounding errors. |
| Exception Assertions (`EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW`, etc.) | Verify that code throws or doesn’t throw expected exceptions. | When testing exception safety or error handling paths (requires exceptions enabled). |
| Predicate Assertions (`EXPECT_PRED*`, `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`) | Use custom predicates or predicate-formatters for complex validations with better failure messages. | When validations exceed simple binary or boolean checks and you want detailed diagnostics. |
| Death Assertions (`EXPECT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_EXIT`, etc.) | Confirm that a code snippet causes termination or a specific exit condition. | When your test validates fatal failure conditions such as program crashes or exit codes. |

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Choosing and Using Assertions

### Step 1: Start Simple with Basic Assertions

Use simple assertions like `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE` first. They keep your tests readable and maintainable.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Detailed failure message";
ASSERT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Expected valid condition";
```

- **Outcome:** If the assertion fails, the test logs the failure; with `EXPECT_`, it continues; with `ASSERT_`, it aborts the current test.

### Step 2: Use Specialized Assertions for Strings

For C-strings, avoid `EXPECT_EQ` since it compares pointers. Use `EXPECT_STREQ` or case-insensitive variants instead.

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(actual_cstr, expected_cstr);
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(actual_cstr, expected_cstr_case_insensitive);
```

- **Example:** Testing two `const char*` variables for identical content.

### Step 3: Apply Floating-Point Assertions for Numerical Comparison

Floating-point comparisons are tricky due to rounding and precision. Use:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` / `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` for near equality based on 4 ULPs.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` when you can specify custom error bounds.

```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(computed_result, expected_result, 0.0001);
```

- **Success Criteria:** The difference does not exceed the specified error.

### Step 4: Validate Exception Behavior

If your function should throw (or not) certain exceptions, assert this explicitly.

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW({ CallThatThrows(); }, std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW({ CallThatDoesNotThrow(); });
```

- Ensure exceptions are enabled in your build.

### Step 5: Craft Complex Conditions Using Predicate Assertions

When simple macros don’t express your logic or yield unclear messages, use predicate assertions.

#### Boolean Predicate Assertions

Define a predicate function:

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return (n % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, val);
```

You get argument values printed on failure automatically.

#### Predicate Formatter Assertions

Write functions returning `testing::AssertionResult` to provide richer diagnostics:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsMutuallyPrime(int m, int n) {
  if (MutuallyPrime(m, n)) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << m << " and " << n << " are not mutually prime.";
}
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(IsMutuallyPrime, a, b);
```

- This emits meaningful failure messages with argument details.

### Step 6: Use Matchers for Readable and Flexible Assertions

Matchers let you express assertions as readable English-like statements and provide detailed failure info.

- Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` and `ASSERT_THAT(value, matcher)`.
- Matchers live in gMock; examples: `StartsWith()`, `Contains()`, `Ge()`, `Lt()`, etc.

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(number, AllOf(Ge(10), Le(20)));
```

- Matchers compose for multi-condition checks.

---

## 3. Best Practices for Crafting Clear Failure Messages

- Always provide custom failure messages with `<<` to add context.
- Prefer nonfatal `EXPECT_` assertions unless failure requires an immediate stop.
- Use predicate-formatters to clarify failures involving complex predicates.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add contextual trace when running subroutines or loops.

---

## 4. User-Defined Assertions and Matchers

GoogleTest enables users to write their own assertions for complex logic and richer failure messages.

### Writing Simple Custom Matchers

Use `MATCHER` macros for quick definitions:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "divisible by 7") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy7());
```

- The failure reports if `value` is not divisible by 7.

### Writing Parameterized Matchers

For matchers with parameters, use `MATCHER_P` or others:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsWithinRange, range, "is within range") {
  return arg >= range.first && arg <= range.second;
}
EXPECT_THAT(x, IsWithinRange(std::make_pair(10, 20)));
```

### Writing Predicate-Formatters

Custom predicates returning `AssertionResult` allow comprehensive failure explanation.

Implement your own functions with signature:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult MyPredicateFormatter(const char* expr1, const char* expr2, T1 val1, T2 val2);
```

They then get used in assertions like:

```cpp
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(MyPredicateFormatter, val_a, val_b);
```

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- Avoid using `ASSERT_*` in non-void functions; fatal failures require void return functions.
- Beware of side-effects in assertion parameters; arguments are evaluated once, but expressions with side-effects can produce surprises.
- Don’t over-constrain your `EXPECT_CALL` or assertions as it leads to brittle tests.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` before code exercising mocks; setting expectations after invoking mocks is undefined behavior.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Assertion Failures

| Problem | Cause & Resolution |
|---------|--------------------|
| Assertion message is unclear or too generic | Use Predicate assertions or matchers to improve failure message clarity.
| Test does not stop on failure as expected | Use `ASSERT_` macros for fatal failures or check control flow if in sub-functions.
| Strings don’t compare as expected | Use `EXPECT_STREQ` for C strings, not `EXPECT_EQ`.
| Floating-point comparisons fail unexpectedly | Switch to `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or use `EXPECT_NEAR` with a tolerance.
| Mock expectations fail unexpectedly | Check call order (`InSequence`), exact argument matchers, and whether defaults are set properly with `ON_CALL`.

### Additional Tips
- Use matcher composition (`AllOf`, `AnyOf`) to clarify multifaceted assertions.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with gMock matchers even outside mocks for expressive assertions.
- Label your tests and assertions clearly to help diagnose failures quickly.

---

### Example: Using an `EXPECT_THAT` with a Matcher

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::StartsWith;

TEST(StringTest, StartsWithHello) {
  std::string greeting = "Hello, World!";
  EXPECT_THAT(greeting, StartsWith("Hello")) << "Greeting should start with 'Hello'";
}
```

### Example: Custom Predicate-Formatter

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Predicate formatter checking that x is even.
testing::AssertionResult IsEvenPredicate(const char* expr, int x) {
  if (x % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " evaluates to " << x << ", which is not even.";
}

TEST(NumberTest, EvenCheck) {
  int val = 3;
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEvenPredicate, val);
}
```

Failure message:
```
Value of: val
  Actual: 3
Expected: IsEvenPredicate(val)
Which is: val evaluates to 3, which is not even.
```
