# Organizing Tests and Test Suites

Effective test organization is crucial for maintaining clarity, scalability, and efficiency in your testing workflow with GoogleTest. This guide focuses on practical strategies for structuring your test cases, grouping them into suites, managing setup and teardown activities, and maintaining large test codebases clean and manageable.

---

## 1. Understanding Tests and Test Suites

- **Test Case**: The smallest testing entity, usually a function or method that verifies a specific aspect of your code.
- **Test Suite**: A grouping of related tests, often reflecting a class or module under test.

In GoogleTest, tests are declared using macros like `TEST` or `TEST_F`, where `TEST_F` supports fixtures for setup and teardown.

<Info>
Test suites group tests logically, improving organization and enabling shared setup/teardown when needed.
</Info>

## 2. Structuring Your Tests

### Basic Test Declaration

To declare a simple test:

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  // Test code goes here
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```

- **TestSuiteName** groups related tests.
- **TestName** identifies the individual test.

### Using Fixtures for Shared Setup/TearDown

When several tests need common set-up or clean-up:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code here runs before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Code here runs after each test
  }

  // Shared objects can be declared here
  int shared_resource;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestOne) {
  // Access 'shared_resource' or other members
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestTwo) {
  // Another test using fixture
}
```

- `TEST_F` associates tests with the fixture class.
- Setup/teardown run automatically before & after each test.

<Note>
Fixtures help reduce duplication and ensure consistent test environments.
</Note>

### Advantages of Using Fixtures

- Centralize setup code
- Share resources across tests
- Ensure clean test isolation

## 3. Managing Setup and Teardown

### Per-Test Setup/TearDown
Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods inside fixtures to prepare and clean the environment for each test.

### Per-TestSuite Setup/TearDown
For expensive setup/teardown needed once per test suite:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Run once before all tests
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Run once after all tests
  }
};
```

This is effective when:

- Initialization is costly
- You want to maintain state across tests within suite

## 4. Organizing Large Test Codebases

### Naming Conventions
- Use clear, consistent naming for test suites and tests.
- Example: `MathUtils_AdditionTest` or `FileParser_InvalidInput`.

### Grouping Related Tests
- Keep related tests together in files and suites.
- Logical grouping helps newcomers find relevant tests quickly.

### Splitting Tests
- Prefer multiple smaller suites over one huge suite.
- Each suite should focus on a single component or feature.

### Using Typed and Parameterized Tests
To avoid duplication when testing multiple data variants:

- Use **Typed Tests** for the same test logic over multiple types.
- Use **Parameterized Tests** for running the same test with varying input values.

See the [Parameterized Testing guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/core-testing-workflows/parameterized-testing.md) for details.

## 5. Best Practices

- **Always add fixtures if setup or teardown is required.**
- **Keep tests small and focused on one behavior.**
- **Use test suites to group logically related tests.**
- **Leverage sequences or partial ordering to verify interactions in order.**
- **Name tests descriptively to clarify intent.**
- **Avoid global or static states that span tests unless controlled.**
- **Use `SetUpTestSuite()` cautiously - shared state increases coupling.**

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### Problem: Setup code not running
<Warning>
If tests don’t seem to use your `SetUp()` or `SetUpTestSuite()`, make sure you use `TEST_F`, and not `TEST`, which does not support fixtures.
</Warning>

### Problem: Tests interfering with each other
<Warning>
Avoid shared mutable static data without synchronization. Prefer per-test setup to isolate tests.
</Warning>

### Problem: Test suites grow too large
<Tip>
Split tests into multiple suites and files based on features or modules.
</Tip>

## 8. Summary

Organizing your tests well helps you scale your testing effectively as your project grows. Leveraging fixtures for shared setup/teardown, grouping related tests into suites, carefully managing test dependencies, and adopting proper naming conventions all contribute to maintainable, readable, and robust test codebases.

# Practical Quickstart Checklist

1. **Define test suites logically per module or feature.**
2. **Use `TEST` for simple tests, `TEST_F` with fixtures when sharing setup/teardown.**
3. **Implement `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for per-test setup, and `SetUpTestSuite()`/`TearDownTestSuite()` for per-suite setup.**
4. **Keep tests independent and focused.**
5. **Review test organization regularly as your codebase scales.**
