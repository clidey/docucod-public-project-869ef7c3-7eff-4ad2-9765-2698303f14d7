# Effective Use of Assertions and Matchers

Explore best practices for leveraging the full suite of assertions and matchers provided by GoogleTest. Learn how to create expressive, maintainable assertions, combine matchers, and diagnose failures with actionable messages.

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide empowers you to write effective and readable test assertions using GoogleTest's rich assertion macros and matchers. You'll learn how to assert various conditions—from simple equality checks to complex predicates—and how to compose these checks to precisely express your test intent.

## 2. Prerequisites

- Your project has GoogleTest properly installed and configured (see [Installation & Setup](../../getting-started/installation-setup/configuration-integration)).
- Basic familiarity with writing `TEST` and `TEST_F` tests.
- Understanding of C++ testing fundamentals (see [GoogleTest Primer](../../docs/primer.md)).

## 3. Expected Outcome

After this guide, you will be able to:

- Use the full range of assertion macros to validate your code.
- Utilize GoogleMock matchers for flexible argument validation with `EXPECT_THAT`.
- Write custom predicates for complex verification with detailed failure messages.
- Combine assertions and matchers to create clear, maintainable tests.

## 4. Time Estimate

Approximately 20-30 minutes for hands-on practice and reading.

## 5. Difficulty Level

Intermediate: Requires some prior knowledge of GoogleTest and C++ unit testing.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Using Assertions and Matchers Effectively

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive suite of assertions and matchers to help you verify your program behavior. Follow the structured steps below to harness their capabilities.

### Step 1: Understand Basic Assertions

- Use `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` or `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` to assert boolean conditions.
- Use `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` or `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` to assert equality.
- Use `_STREQ` macros (e.g., `EXPECT_STREQ`) for C-string contents comparison.

**Outcome:** Immediate validation of simple conditions.

#### Example:
```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, SimpleEquality) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid());
  ASSERT_EQ(sum, 10);
  EXPECT_STREQ(str1, "expected");
}
```

---

### Step 2: Leverage GoogleMock Matchers with `EXPECT_THAT`

GoogleTest supports [GoogleMock matchers](../reference/matchers.md) to make assertions more expressive and flexible.

- Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` or `ASSERT_THAT(value, matcher)`.
- Matchers can describe complex conditions, e.g., `StartsWith()`, `HasSubstr()`, `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`, and relational matchers like `Gt()`, `Le()`, etc.

**Outcome:** Readable assertions that clearly communicate intent and provide detailed failure explanations.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;

TEST(MyTestSuite, MatcherUsage) {
  std::string s = "HelloWorld";
  EXPECT_THAT(s, StartsWith("Hello"));

  int value = 7;
  ASSERT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));

  std::string regex_str = "Line 123";
  EXPECT_THAT(regex_str, MatchesRegex("Line \\d+"));
}
```

---

### Step 3: Compose Matchers for Complex Checks

- Combine matchers with `AllOf()` to require all conditions.
- Use `AnyOf()` to succeed if any one condition is true.
- Negate matchers with `Not()`.
- Use container matchers like `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `Contains()`, and `Each()` to validate container contents.

**Outcome:** Powerful assertions for precise verification of complex data structures.

#### Example:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::ElementsAre;
using ::testing::Not;
using ::testing::Gt;

TEST(MyTestSuite, ContainerMatchers) {
  std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
  EXPECT_THAT(numbers, ElementsAre(1, 2, Not(3), Gt(3)));

  EXPECT_THAT(numbers, Not(ElementsAre(4, 3, 2, 1)));
}
```

---

### Step 4: Use Predicate and Predicate-Formatter Assertions for Custom Logic

- Use `EXPECT_PRED*()` macros to assert predicates with up to 5 arguments.
- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*()` to customize failure message formatting.
- Write predicate functions returning `testing::AssertionResult` for richer messages.

**Outcome:** Detailed and helpful failure messages even for complex conditions.

#### Example:
```cpp
bool AreMutuallyPrime(int a, int b) {
  // Implement logic
}

testing::AssertionResult AssertMutuallyPrime(const char* a_expr,
                                             const char* b_expr,
                                             int a, int b) {
  if (AreMutuallyPrime(a, b)) {
    return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  }
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << a << " and " << b << " are not mutually prime";
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, PredicateFormatter) {
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(AssertMutuallyPrime, 7, 9);  // May fail with message
}
```

---

### Step 5: Integrate Assertions in Subroutines and Test Helpers

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add context when assertions are inside helper functions.
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or check `HasFatalFailure()` after calling helper functions.

**Outcome:** Easier diagnosis of failures inside deeply nested or reused code.

#### Example:
```cpp
void CheckValues(int x) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("Checking x parameter");
  EXPECT_GT(x, 0);
  EXPECT_LT(x, 10);
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, HelperUsage) {
  CheckValues(15);  // Fails with trace information
}
```

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_*` for non-fatal assertions, allowing tests to report multiple errors.
- Use `ASSERT_*` for critical checks that must abort the current test function.
- Prefer matchers with `EXPECT_THAT` for readable and expressive assertions.
- Avoid over-specifying argument matchers; use `_` when arguments are irrelevant.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add diagnostic context in helper functions.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations when multiple overlapping `EXPECT_CALL` definitions exist.
- Cache or reuse complex matchers for performance and maintainability.

### Common Pitfalls

- Comparing C strings with `EXPECT_EQ` compares addresses, use `EXPECT_STREQ`.
- `ASSERT_*` macros abort only the current function, not the entire test unless propagated.
- Be aware that side effects inside matchers or predicates can cause flaky tests.
- Always specify `.Times()` in `EXPECT_CALL` if the call count matters.
- Use `SafeMatcherCast<T>()` to avoid type mismatches in matchers.

### Troubleshooting

- If assertion messages are unclear, try using predicate-formatters or custom matchers.
- If you see unexpected behavior in mock matches, run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed matching logs.
- For failing string comparisons, check if strings include null characters or case differences.
- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` for complex predicates needing detailed failure explanations.
- When testing code involving pointers, be sure to use `Pointee()` for values pointed by the pointers.

## Examples

### Using Assertions to Validate Values

```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, BasicComparisons) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid());
  ASSERT_FALSE(IsEmpty());

  int expected = 10;
  int actual = ComputeValue();
  EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual) << "Value did not match expectation.";
}
```

### Using Matchers for Flexible Argument Validation

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::_;

TEST(MyTestSuite, StringContents) {
  std::string s = GetUserName();

  EXPECT_THAT(s, StartsWith("User_"));
  EXPECT_THAT(s, Not(StartsWith("Guest_")));

  EXPECT_THAT(s, _);  // Matches anything.
}
```

### Combining Matchers for Complex Conditions

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Le;

TEST(MyTestSuite, NumberRange) {
  int x = GetNumber();
  EXPECT_THAT(x, AllOf(Gt(0), Le(100)));  // x must be between 1 and 100 inclusive
}
```

### Custom Predicate Formatter for Detailed Failure Output

```cpp
bool IsPositive(int n) { return n > 0; }

testing::AssertionResult AssertPositive(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (n > 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " (= " << n << ") is not positive";
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, CustomPredicate) {
  int val = -5;
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(AssertPositive, val);
}
```

Output on failure:

```
Value of: val
Expected: val (= -5) is not positive
```

<Tip>
Use expressive assertions to communicate your test's intent clearly — this not only simplifies debugging but also ensures your tests serve as documentation for expected behavior.
</Tip>

<Note>
Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with matchers whenever possible for cleaner, readable, and meaningful failures.
</Note>

<Warning>
Avoid side effects in predicates and matchers; GoogleTest may invoke them multiple times unpredictably.
