# Writing and Structuring Tests

This guide explains how to effectively write and organize your GoogleTest test cases. You will learn how to define individual test cases, group related tests into test suites, use fixtures to share setup and teardown code, and organize your test code for clarity and maintainability. This document emphasizes idiomatic usage patterns inspired by the xUnit style and GoogleTest specifics to help you build robust and reusable test suites.

## 1. Understanding Test Cases and Test Suites

### What You Will Achieve
- Learn how to define individual tests (test cases) using the `TEST()` macro
- Understand grouping tests logically into test suites for better organization
- Appreciate the rationale behind test naming conventions for clarity and maintainability

### Key Concepts
- **Test Case (Test):** An individual test verifying a specific behavior or condition.
- **Test Suite:** A collection of related test cases, grouped by functionality or module.

### Defining a Simple Test Case
GoogleTest uses the `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro to define tests:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

- The first argument `FactorialTest` is the test suite name.
- The second argument `HandlesZeroInput` is the name of the individual test.
- Both names should be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.

### Best Practices for Naming
- Use descriptive names reflecting what the test checks.
- Group logically related tests under the same suite name.
- Avoid underscores to maintain consistency with GoogleTest conventions.

## 2. Grouping Tests with Test Fixtures

### Why Use Fixtures?
Fixtures allow multiple tests to reuse the same setup and teardown code, preventing duplication and ensuring consistency.

### Creating a Test Fixture
1. Derive a class from `testing::Test`.
2. Define member variables and setup code inside the class.
3. Use the `TEST_F()` macro to write tests that use the fixture.

Example:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Common setup
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Important Details
- Each test using the fixture gets a fresh instance.
- Setup via constructor or `SetUp()`.
- Teardown via destructor or `TearDown()`.
- Use `ASSERT_` in tests when failure should stop execution.

## 3. Organizing Complex Test Suites

### Using Sub-suites and Modularity
As your tests grow, consider splitting logically distinct groups into separate test suites or files. This improves maintainability and aligns tests with code structure.

### Progressive Testing Strategy
Start with simple tests (basic behaviors), then add tests for edge cases, exceptional conditions, and integration scenarios.

### Handling Parameterized Tests
For systematic testing across different inputs, use GoogleTest's parameterized test support (`TEST_P`) - see the related documentation.

---

## 4. Writing Clear, Maintainable Tests

### Follow Google C++ Style Guide for Naming
- Use CamelCase for class names and test suite names.
- Use descriptive names that convey the intent of tests.

### Keep Tests Small and Focused
Each test should verify one behavior or aspect to simplify diagnosis of failures.

### Provide Helpful Failure Messages
Use `EXPECT_*` macros with custom failure messages when useful.

### Example of a Well-structured Test
```cpp
TEST(CalculatorTest, AdditionWorks) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5) << "Addition failed for inputs 2 and 3";
}
```

---

## 5. Using Test Fixtures with Mocks

When introducing mock objects (via GoogleMock), test fixtures become essential for sharing mock setup and common expectations.

```cpp
class NetworkClientTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  MockNetwork mock_network_;

  void SetUp() override {
    ON_CALL(mock_network_, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  }
};

TEST_F(NetworkClientTest, ConnectReturnsTrue) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_network_, Connect()).Times(1);
  NetworkClient client(&mock_network_);
  EXPECT_TRUE(client.Connect());
}
```

---

## 6. Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Order of Tests:** GoogleTest runs tests in alphabetical order by default; do not rely on test execution order.
- **Isolate Tests:** Avoid creating dependencies between tests.
- **Use `TEST_F` for shared contexts:** It prevents code duplication and reduces setup errors.
- **Avoid overly strict expectations:** Overly specific tests that tightly couple to implementation details cause brittleness.

# Summary

This guide equips you to write clear, organized, and maintainable tests in GoogleTest. You learned how to define simple tests with `TEST()`, group and share setup using test fixtures with `TEST_F()`, and organize your test code to scale effectively. With these practices, your test suites will be easier to read, debug, and extend over time.

# Code Samples

Below is a simple example demonstrating test and fixture usage together:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Function to test
int Add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

// Simple Test
TEST(AddTest, PositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);
}

// Test Fixture
class MathTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    base_ = 10;
  }

  int base_;
};

TEST_F(MathTest, AddBase) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(base_, 5), 15);
}
```

When we run these tests, both will be executed independently, and the fixture ensures consistent setup for multiple related tests.
