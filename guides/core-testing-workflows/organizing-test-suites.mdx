# Organizing and Managing Test Suites

## Overview

When your C++ project grows, managing your test suite efficiently is crucial to keep tests maintainable, fast, and clear. This page provides best practices focused specifically on organizing your tests in GoogleTest and GoogleMock, leveraging setup and teardown methods, grouping strategies, and running subsets of tests effectively.

By following these guidelines, you will write tests that are easier to read, reduce duplication, and make your testing workflow more productive.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
- Organize tests into suites and files logically
- Use setup and teardown fixtures effectively for shared resources
- Group and sequence tests using GoogleMock's support
- Run targeted subsets of tests to accelerate feedback

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of writing tests in GoogleTest
- Familiarity with mocks, fixtures, and `EXPECT_CALL` / `ON_CALL`
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed and configured

### Expected Outcome
You will structure your tests so they are modular, easy to maintain, and can be run selectively. This results in faster test execution, less flaky tests, and clearer intent.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30 minutes to an hour based on test suite size and existing organization.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## 2. Organizing Test Suites

### 2.1 Group Tests by Logical Units or Features

- Place related tests in the same source file or directory.
- Use meaningful test suite names via `TEST_F` or `TEST_P` to represent the component or feature under test.
- Avoid putting too many unrelated tests in one file; it hampers readability and slows down targeted runs.

Example:
```cpp
class StorageTest : public ::testing::Test { ... };

TEST_F(StorageTest, SaveData) {
  ...
}

TEST_F(StorageTest, LoadData) {
  ...
}
```

### 2.2 Structure Mock Classes Closely to Interfaces

- Define mock classes near their interfaces or in dedicated test or `mocks` directories.
- Use GoogleMock's `MOCK_METHOD` macro in `public:` scope for all mocked virtual methods.
- Mock classes should be concise and focused.

### 2.3 Use Test Fixtures for Shared Setup and Teardown

- Encapsulate common test initialization inside `SetUp()` and cleanup in `TearDown()` methods of test fixtures.
- Share common mocks and resources as fixture members.

Example:
```cpp
class NetworkTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize common mocks or resources
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
  }

  MockNetworkClient mock_client_;
};

TEST_F(NetworkTest, ConnectsSuccessfully) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_client_, Connect()).WillOnce(Return(true));
  ...
}
```

<Tip>
Use fixtures to eliminate duplication and make tests easier to extend.
</Tip>

### 2.4 Leverage Sequences and Expectations Order

- Use `::testing::InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to enforce order of calls in mocks when needed.
- Group related expectations together inside an `InSequence` block to express sequential call dependencies.

Example:
```cpp
{
  ::testing::InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2());
}
```

### 2.5 Use Groups and Suites in Test Runners

- Naming conventions in test suites facilitate running targeted tests.
- Prefer descriptive names that represent subsystems or behavior.
- Use test filters when running tests to select subsets.

---

## 3. Running Subsets of Your Tests

### 3.1 Command-Line Filters

GoogleTest supports running subsets of tests using filters:

```bash
test_binary --gtest_filter=SuiteName.TestName
```

Supports:
- Wildcards: `*`
- Multiple patterns separated by `:`

Example:
```bash
test_binary --gtest_filter=StorageTest.*
```

### 3.2 Selective Running from IDE or Build Systems

- Configure your IDE or CI system to run specific test suites or named tests.
- This accelerates iterative feedback on code changes.

### 3.3 Grouping with Test Fixtures

- Use fixtures/classes effectively to logically group tests, making test selection based on class easier.

---

## 4. Best Practices & Tips

- **Define virtual destructors on interfaces** to avoid unexpected behavior or leaks in mocks.
- **Avoid over-specification**: Use wildcards (`_`) or omit parameters in `EXPECT_CALL` where argument values don't matter.
- **Set default behaviors with `ON_CALL`** to minimize verbose expectations.
- **Use `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` judiciously**:
  - `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
  - `StrictMock` turns such calls into failures.
- **Write clear expectations with ordering only when necessary**; avoid brittle tests.
- **Use `RetiresOnSaturation()`** where expectations should retire after being fulfilled to avoid conflicts with subsequent calls.
- **Keep mocks small and focused**, create specialized test mocks instead of bloated ones.

<Tip>
For non-trivial mocks, delegate default behavior to fakes or real objects using `ON_CALL` to keep tests maintainable.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Uninteresting Call Warnings

- If you see "Uninteresting mock function call" warning, consider:
  - Adding `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` if calls are expected but ignored.
  - Using `NiceMock` to suppress noisy warnings.
  - Confirm that missing `EXPECT_CALL` is not a bug.

### 5.2 Mismatched EXPECT_CALL Order

- Remember newer expectations override older ones.
- For ordered calls, use `InSequence` or `After` clauses explicitly.

### 5.3 Leaked Mocks

- Ensure mocks are deleted or use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentionally leaked.

### 5.4 Over-Specification of Arguments

- Avoid matching excessively specific argument values that are irrelevant to the test intent.

### 5.5 Setup and Teardown Mistakes

- Verify fixture `SetUp()` completes necessary initialization.
- Avoid side effects that leak across tests.

## 6. Example: Organizing a Networking Module Test Suite

```cpp
// In networking_test.cc

class MockSocket : public SocketInterface {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& host, int port), (override));
   MOCK_METHOD(void, Close, (), (override));
};

class NetworkTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Set up common mocks
  }

  MockSocket mock_socket_;
};

TEST_F(NetworkTest, ConnectsToValidAddress) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_socket_, Connect(_, _))
      .WillOnce(Return(true));

  NetworkClient client(&mock_socket_);
  ASSERT_TRUE(client.Connect("example.com", 80));
}

TEST_F(NetworkTest, FailsOnInvalidAddress) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_socket_, Connect(_, _))
      .WillOnce(Return(false));

  NetworkClient client(&mock_socket_);
  ASSERT_FALSE(client.Connect("invalid", 0));
}
```

Use fixture `NetworkTest` to group related test cases; mocks are set up for all tests.

## 8. Summary

Maintaining an organized and well-structured test suite is essential as your codebase scales. Group your tests clearly using test fixtures, leverage GoogleMock sequences when order matters, set sensible default actions, and run test subsets efficiently using filters and naming conventions. These best practices enhance your test readability, maintainability, and performance.
