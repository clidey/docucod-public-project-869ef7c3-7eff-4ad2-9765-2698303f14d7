# Getting Started with GoogleTest

Welcome to your first step in harnessing the power of GoogleTest, Google's C++ testing framework. This guide walks you through setting up GoogleTest in your project, writing your very first test, and executing it successfully. Whether you're new to testing or simply new to GoogleTest, this introduction will empower you to start building organized, maintainable test suites with confidence.

---

## 1. What You'll Achieve in This Guide

- Set up basic GoogleTest configuration within your project
- Write and understand your first simple test
- Run your test and interpret its results
- Learn best practices for naming and test organization

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

- You have a working C++ development environment with a compiler that supports at least C++17
- GoogleTest is included in your project or is set up via your build system (refer to the [Quickstart: Building with CMake](quickstart-cmake.md) for integration)
- Basic familiarity with C++ syntax

### Expected Outcomes

By following this guide, you will be able to write and run a basic GoogleTest test suite that validates your code’s correctness, laying the foundation for more advanced test scenarios.

### Time Commitment

Approximately 15–30 minutes depending on familiarity with build tools.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner — no prior experience with GoogleTest needed.

## 2. Setting Up Your First GoogleTest Test

This section guides you through the essential steps needed to write and execute your first GoogleTest test.

### Step 1: Include the GoogleTest Header

GoogleTest’s functionality is accessed by including its main header at the top of your test file.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```


### Step 2: Write a Simple Test Using `TEST()`

GoogleTest's primary unit of work is the *test*, which you define using the `TEST()` macro. It requires two identifier arguments: `TestSuiteName` and `TestName`.

> **Tip:** Avoid using underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names as GoogleTest reserves underscores for internal purposes which could cause your tests to fail unexpectedly in some environments.

Example:

```cpp
// Defines a test in test suite 'HelloTest' with the name 'BasicAssertions'
TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Expect two strings not to be equal.
  EXPECT_STRNE("hello", "world");

  // Expect integers to be equal.
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
}
```


### Step 3: Understanding Assertions

- `EXPECT_*` assertions record failures but allow the test to continue.
- `ASSERT_*` assertions record failures and abort the current test function immediately.

Here, `EXPECT_EQ` and `EXPECT_STRNE` check for equality and inequality, producing clear messages if the assertion fails.


### Step 4: Running Your Tests

After writing your tests, you can run them with GoogleTest's test runner. Typically, this is done by linking with `gtest_main` (which provides a convenient `main()`), or by defining your own `main()` like this:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- `InitGoogleTest()` initializes GoogleTest and parses flags.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` runs all registered tests and returns 0 if all succeed.


### Step 5: Build and Execute Your Tests

Compile your test source and link it against GoogleTest libraries.

Example CMake snippet:

```cmake
add_executable(hello_test hello_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(hello_test GTest::gtest_main)
```

Run the test binary:

```shell
$ ./hello_test
```
GoogleTest outputs succinct information about which tests ran and their pass/fail status.

## 3. Best Practices and Tips for Writing Your First Tests

### Naming Tests

- Use *CamelCase* or *PascalCase* with no underscores.
- Ensure test suite names group logically related tests.
- Test names should describe the behavior or condition being verified.


### Organizing Tests

GoogleTest groups tests into *test suites* for structure and maintainability. Write multiple related tests within the same suite to share a common context later if you expand with fixtures.


### Use Assertions Thoughtfully

- Prefer `EXPECT_*` if you want the test to continue after failures.
- Use `ASSERT_*` when subsequent code depends on successful assertions.


### Avoid Common Pitfalls

- Do not ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. It signals if any test failed.
- Don’t mix test suite or test names with underscores to avoid unpredictable behaviors.
- Remember tests run in isolation; they cannot depend on a specific order.

## 4. Extending Your Tests with Fixtures (Optional Preview)

If you want to share objects or setup code across multiple tests, GoogleTest allows you to write *test fixtures*.

For example:

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Preparation before each test in this fixture
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup after each test
  }

  // Shared member variables
  int shared_value = 42;
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, FirstTest) {
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_value, 42);
}
```

Using fixtures improves code reuse and test clarity.

## 5. Troubleshooting Your First Test Run

### Common Issues

- **Tests not discovered or not running:** Verify test macros are used correctly and linked with GoogleTest.
- **Linker errors:** Ensure GoogleTest libraries and include paths are correctly configured.
- **Naming errors:** Remove underscores from test suite and test names.
- **Ignoring return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`:** Make sure main() returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.


### Tips

- Run a single test using `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` to isolate failures.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to list all discovered tests.
- Use verbose flags like `--gtest_break_on_failure` to help debugging.

For deeper troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls](getting-started/first-test-usage/troubleshooting-setup) guide.

## 6. Next Steps

You’re now set to explore GoogleTest’s richer features:

- Learn [writing more effective assertions](writing-effective-assertions.md) to produce better diagnostics.
- Explore [test fixtures more deeply](primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests) for reusable test setup.
- Try [parameterized tests](advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) to cover multiple scenarios efficiently.
- Dive into [mocking with GoogleMock](mocking-with-gmock.md) to test interactions in complex systems.

Happy testing!
