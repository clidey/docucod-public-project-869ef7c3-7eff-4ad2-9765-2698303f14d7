# Using Matchers for Flexible Verification

Explore how GoogleMock matchers can simplify and strengthen test expectations by handling custom types, partial matches, and complex argument combinations.

---

## Overview

Matchers are the heart of GoogleMock's flexibility — they empower you to specify expected values or conditions for mock method arguments beyond exact equality. This page shows how to leverage gMock matchers to write expressive tests that verify interactions precisely and maintainably.

### What You Will Learn

- How to use matchers to verify arguments in mock calls
- Combining matchers to express complex expectations
- Working with custom types and partial object matching
- Advanced usage with multi-argument matchers and predicates

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with mocking basics and writing simple `EXPECT_CALL` statements
- Understanding of `MOCK_METHOD` and how to create mock classes (see the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html))

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you'll gain confidence to:

- Write expectations with matchers for flexible argument verification
- Use built-in matchers to handle common scenarios like ranges, strings, containers
- Define and use custom matchers for domain-specific verification
- Compose matchers for rich and precise test validations

### Time Estimate

Allow approximately 20-30 minutes to get comfortable with matchers and try examples.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate — some familiarity with GoogleMock and C++ testing syntax assumed.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Matchers

### 1. Use Basic Matchers for Argument Verification

Matchers replace exact values in expectations to describe argument conditions rather than exact matches.

Example - verify a mock method is called with a specific integer argument:

```cpp
using ::testing::Eq;
using ::testing::_;  // wildcard matcher

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Eq(5)));  // argument must be 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_));      // argument can be anything
```

The underscore `_` is a special matcher matching any value of the correct type.

### 2. Utilize Common Matchers for Numeric Comparisons and Strings

Matchers like `Ge()`, `Le()`, `HasSubstr()`, and `StartsWith()` handle ranges or string matches.

```cpp
using ::testing::Ge;
using ::testing::HasSubstr;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Ge(10)));               // argument >= 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Log(HasSubstr("error")));      // string contains "error"
```

### 3. Combine Matchers for Complex Conditions

To express multiple constraints, use `AllOf()` (must satisfy all) or `AnyOf()` (must satisfy any). ``

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Ne;
using ::testing::Lt;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(AllOf(Ge(5), Ne(10))));  // 5 <= arg != 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(AnyOf(Lt(0), Ge(20))));  // arg < 0 or arg >= 20
```

### 4. Use Matchers for Verifying Complex or Custom Types

You can match parts of a complex object using `Field()` or `Property()` to specify conditions on fields or getter methods.

```cpp
using ::testing::Field;
using ::testing::Property;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Handle(
    Field(&Widget::status, Eq(Widget::kReady))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Handle(Property(&Widget::GetName, StartsWith("foo"))));
```

### 5. Match Pointer Arguments with `Pointee()` and Null Checks

To verify the object pointed to by a pointer argument, use `Pointee(matcher)`. Combine with `IsNull()` or `NotNull()` to check pointer validity.

```cpp
using ::testing::Pointee;
using ::testing::NotNull;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Pointee(Eq(5))));      // pointer to value 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(NotNull()));            // pointer must not be NULL
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(IsNull()));              // pointer must be NULL
```

Supports both raw pointers and smart pointers.

### 6. Work with Multiple Arguments as Tuples

Verify relationships between multiple arguments with `.With()` clause and multi-argument matchers like `Args<>`, `AllArgs()`, and `Lt()`, `Ne()`, etc.

```cpp
using ::testing::Args;
using ::testing::Lt;
using ::testing::Ne;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Range(Ne(0), _))
    .With(Lt());  // first argument < second

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Range(_, _))
    .With(AllOf(Args<0,1>(Lt()), Args<1,2>(Lt())));
```

### 7. Use Custom Predicate Matchers for Arbitrary Conditions

When built-in matchers are not sufficient, wrap your predicate functions in `Truly(predicate)`.

```cpp
using ::testing::Truly;

bool IsEven(int n) { return (n % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Truly(IsEven)));  // argument must be even
```

Custom matchers can be polymorphic, typed, and provide rich diagnostics.

### 8. Share Matchers by Assigning to Variables

For complex or repeated matchers, define them once and reuse:

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Le;

auto in_range = AllOf(Gt(5), Le(10));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(in_range));
EXPECT_CALL(mock2, Process(in_range));
```

This reduces clutter and enhances readability.

### 9. Use Policy Classes to Control Uninteresting Calls

By default, uninteresting calls generate warnings. Use `NiceMock<MockFoo>` to suppress warnings, or `StrictMock<MockFoo>` to turn warnings into errors.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;    // suppresses uninteresting warnings
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;  // makes unexpected calls errors
```

---

## Examples

### Exact Argument Match

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5));  // matches calls to Foo(5) exactly
```

### Using Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(5)));  // matches Foo(arg) with arg >= 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(StartsWith("foo")));  // matches string starting with "foo"
```

### Combining Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(AllOf(Ge(5), Ne(10))));  // argument >= 5 and != 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(AnyOf(Lt(0), Ge(20))));  // argument < 0 or >= 20
```

### Matching Object Members

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Handle(Field(&Item::id, Eq(10))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Handle(Property(&Item::GetName, HasSubstr("abc"))));
```

### Matching Pointers

```cpp
int x = 42;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Pointee(Eq(42))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(NotNull()));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(IsNull()));
```

### Multi-Argument Matching

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compare(Ne(0), _))
    .With(Lt()); // first arg != 0 and first < second
```

### Custom Predicate Matcher

```cpp
bool IsOdd(int n) { return (n % 2) == 1; }
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Truly(IsOdd)));
```

### Using Shared Matchers

```cpp
auto valid_age = AllOf(Ge(18), Le(65));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetAge(valid_age));
EXPECT_CALL(another_mock, CheckAge(valid_age));
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Mismatch of argument types**: Ensure the matcher and argument types are compatible. Use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` if necessary.
- **Overloaded method ambiguity**: Specify argument types or mock interface to avoid ambiguity.
- **Uninteresting calls warnings**: Use `NiceMock` to suppress nuisance warnings, or add catch-all expectations using `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.

### Best Practices

- Prefer matchers over exact values for flexible and maintainable tests.
- Use composite matchers (`AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`) to express combined conditions clearly.
- Take advantage of `Field()` and `Property()` for partial object verification rather than comparing whole objects.
- Carefully consider the specificity of your matchers: overly strict matchers make tests brittle.
- Structure tests so that only the essential behavior is verified with matchers.

### Performance Considerations

Matching can add minor overhead in complex tests. Use simple matchers where high performance is crucial.

### Alternative Approaches

- For very complex matchers reused widely, consider writing custom matcher classes.
- To verify function-call sequences or argument relationships, use multi-argument matchers with `.With()`.
