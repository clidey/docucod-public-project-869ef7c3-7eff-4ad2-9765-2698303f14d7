# Writing Effective Assertions

Master the variety of GoogleTest assertions—including checks for equality, exceptions, and complex conditions—using real-world code samples and recommended practices for robust failure analysis.

---

## 1. Introduction to Assertions

Assertions are the backbone of your tests in GoogleTest. They verify that your code behaves as expected. Understanding which assertion to use in different scenarios ensures your tests are meaningful and maintainable.

GoogleTest provides two major types of assertions:

- **Fatal assertions** (`ASSERT_` macros): Stop test execution immediately on failure.
- **Nonfatal assertions** (`EXPECT_` macros): Report failure but continue test execution.

Use fatal assertions when further execution depends on the success of the check.

---

## 2. Basic Use of Assertions

### Checking Boolean Conditions

Use `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` or `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` to verify a condition is true. Similarly, use `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` and `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)`.

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(x > 0);
ASSERT_FALSE(ptr == nullptr);
```

### Checking Equality and Inequality

Use `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` and `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` to check for equality and inequality respectively.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value);
ASSERT_NE(pointer, nullptr);
```

Note:

- For pointer equality on C strings, use `EXPECT_STREQ` and `EXPECT_STRNE` to compare the contents rather than addresses.

### Helpful Tip

All assertions support adding messages for clarity:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Result does not match expected value";
```

---

## 3. Comparing Floating-Point Numbers

Due to precision limitations, use specialized assertions:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` for `float` comparisons.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` for `double` comparisons.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` for approximate equality within an absolute error.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(computed_pi, 3.141592653589793);
EXPECT_NEAR(measured_value, expected_value, 0.001);
```

---

## 4. String Assertions

### C String Comparisons

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` verifies two C strings have identical contents.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` verifies two C strings differ.
- Case-insensitive comparisons:
  - `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)`
  - `EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2)`

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(actual_c_str, "hello");
EXPECT_STRNE(actual_c_str, "world");
```

For `std::string` objects, use `EXPECT_EQ`.

---

## 5. Exception Assertions

GoogleTest supports verifying exceptions to make sure your code properly handles error conditions.

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` expects a specific exception.
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` expects any exception.
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` expects no exception.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(ValidateInput(-1), std::invalid_argument);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(ProcessData());
```

Note: Exception support requires your build environment to enable exceptions.

---

## 6. Using `EXPECT_THAT` with Matchers

For complex or expressive conditions, use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)`. Matchers allow flexible and descriptive assertions.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;

EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
EXPECT_THAT(log, MatchesRegex("Error \d+"));
```

Matchers come in many forms—see GoogleMock's Matchers Reference for full details.

---

## 7. General Best Practices

- **Choose the right assertion type**: Use `ASSERT_` when failure prevents further correct test execution; use `EXPECT_` otherwise.

- **Be specific but not brittle**: Avoid over-specifying assertions that make your test fragile.

- **Write clear error messages** with the streaming operator `<<` to ease debugging.

- **Use suite-level setup** to avoid redundant assertions.

- **Verify floating-point comparisons carefully** using specialized macros.

- **Test for exceptions explicitly** to prevent missing expected error handling.

- **Utilize matchers** with `EXPECT_THAT` for clean, expressive assertions.

## 8. Real-World Code Examples

### Checking Return Values and Pointers

```cpp
TEST(FileHandlerTest, OpensFileSuccessfully) {
  FileHandler handler;

  int result = handler.Open("file.txt");
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 0) << "File should open successfully";

  const char* content = handler.GetContent();
  ASSERT_NE(content, nullptr) << "Content should not be null";
}
```

### Floating-Point Approximate Comparison

```cpp
TEST(CalculatorTest, ComputesPiApproximately) {
  Calculator calc;
  double pi = calc.GetPiEstimate();

  EXPECT_NEAR(pi, 3.14159, 0.0001);
}
```

### Exception Testing

```cpp
TEST(DatabaseTest, ThrowsOnInvalidQuery) {
  Database db;
  EXPECT_THROW(db.Query("BAD SQL"), DatabaseException);
}
```

### Using Matchers

```cpp
TEST(UserTest, NameStartsWithLetter) {
  User user("Alice");
  EXPECT_THAT(user.GetName(), testing::StartsWith("A"));
}
```

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Failures

### Unexpected Equality Failures

- Verify you are using the correct equality macro: Use `EXPECT_STREQ` for C strings, `EXPECT_EQ` for other types.
- Check if your objects have proper `operator==` implementations.

### Floating-Point Comparison Issues

- Avoid `EXPECT_EQ` for floats/doubles; use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR`.

### Exception Assertion Issues

- Make sure exceptions are enabled in your compiler settings.
- Ensure the code under test actually throws the expected exception type.

### Asserting Pointers

- Beware of comparing pointer addresses vs. pointed-to values.
- Use `EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr)` to check for non-null pointers.
