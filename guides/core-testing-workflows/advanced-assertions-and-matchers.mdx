# Using Advanced Assertions and Matchers

Go beyond basic assertions by leveraging GoogleTest's rich assertions and expressive matchers for validating complex conditions and object states. This guide provides practical examples to help you write more descriptive, meaningful tests.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve
This guide shows you how to write advanced assertions beyond simple equality or Boolean checks, enabling you to validate complex code behaviors and object states clearly and powerfully within GoogleTest. You will learn how to leverage predicate assertions, predicate-formatter assertions, floating-point comparisons, exception assertions, and expressive matcher-based assertions.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest assertions and writing simple test cases.
- Your project correctly integrates GoogleTest and includes `<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>` when needed.

### Outcome
By following this guide, you will produce tests that provide clearer, more meaningful error messages, facilitating easier debugging and enhancing test expressiveness. Your tests will also be more robust and easier to maintain over time.

### Time Commitment
Approximately 20-40 minutes to understand the concepts and apply examples.

### Skill Level
Intermediate â€“ knowledge of writing basic tests and assertions required.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Advanced Assertions and Matchers

### 1. Understanding Rich Assertions

GoogleTest provides many assertion macros that go beyond simple `EXPECT_EQ` or `EXPECT_TRUE`. These include:

- **Explicit Success/Failure Macros**: `SUCCEED()`, `FAIL()` to mark success or fatal failure explicitly.
- **Boolean Condition Assertions**: `EXPECT_TRUE()`, `EXPECT_FALSE()` including those with predicate functions that return detailed results.
- **Binary Comparisons**: `EXPECT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NE()`, `EXPECT_LT()`, etc., which produce detailed messages on failure.
- **String Comparisons**: `EXPECT_STREQ()`, `EXPECT_STRNE()`, and case-insensitive variants.
- **Floating-Point Comparisons**: `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ()`, and `EXPECT_NEAR()` for handling precision issues.
- **Exception Assertions**: Verify thrown exceptions with `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW()`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW()`.
- **Predicate Assertions**: Use functions returning `bool` or `testing::AssertionResult` to check complex conditions with rich failure messages.
- **Matcher Assertions**: Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with gMock matchers for expressive, English-like assertions.


### 2. Using Predicate Assertions for Complex Boolean Checks

Simply asserting a complex condition can be opaque on failure because GoogleTest does not show which sub-expressions failed. You can improve this by:

#### Using Predicate Functions Returning `bool`

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

If the assertion fails, GoogleTest prints the argument value.

#### Using Predicate Functions Returning `AssertionResult`

Write a function returning `testing::AssertionResult` to provide detailed pass/fail messages:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AssertionResult;

AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return AssertionSuccess();
  return AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(value));
```

This gives failure messages like:

```
Value of: IsEven(value)
  Actual: false (3 is odd)
Expected: true
```

#### Using Predicate-Formatter Assertions

For full control over failure messages (especially when predicate arguments cannot be streamed), write a *predicate-formatter* function:

```cpp
AssertionResult AssertMutuallyPrime(const char* expr1, const char* expr2,
                                     int m, int n) {
  if (MutuallyPrime(m, n)) return AssertionSuccess();
  return AssertionFailure() << expr1 << " and " << expr2
                           << " (" << m << " and " << n << ") are not mutually prime";
}

EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(AssertMutuallyPrime, a, b);
```

### 3. Leveraging Floating-Point Comparison Assertions

Due to precision issues, comparing floating-point numbers with exact equality is often incorrect. Use these:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` compare `float`s approximately.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` compare `double`s approximately.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` checks if values differ by no more than `abs_error`.

These provide useful failure diagnostics specific to floating-point nuances.

Use predicate-format versions (`FloatLE`, `DoubleLE`) if you need custom behavior.

### 4. Using Exception Assertions

Test whether code throws exceptions as expected:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(SomeFunction(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_ANY_THROW(SomeFunction());
EXPECT_NO_THROW(AnotherFunction());
```

Use compound statements for multiple lines:

```cpp
EXPECT_NO_THROW({
  Initialize();
  DoSomething();
});
```

### 5. Writing Assertions Using gMock Matchers with `EXPECT_THAT` and `ASSERT_THAT`

gMock provides a rich set of reusable, composable matchers that make assertions read like English sentences and give more meaningful failure reports.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;

EXPECT_THAT(value1, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(value2, MatchesRegex("Line \\d+"));
ASSERT_THAT(value3, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
```

Matchers support complex checks, including container elements, property checks, pointers, nested matchers, and more. They allow you to replace brittle, verbose checks with concise expressive ones.

### 6. Combining Assertions and Traces

When you write helper functions called by multiple tests, failures can be tricky to trace. Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information to failure messages:

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Iteration " + std::to_string(i));
MyHelperFunction(x);
```

This is invaluable to differentiate failures during loops or multiple invocations.

### 7. Best Practices

- Prefer `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*` when feasible, to allow the test to continue and report multiple errors.
- Use rich assertions with informative failure messages to save debugging time.
- Avoid side effects inside matchers or predicates; they must be pure functions.
- Use predicate assertions or matchers to test complex conditions instead of constructing manual messages.
- For floating-point numbers, **never** use `EXPECT_EQ` for equality tests.
- Use `EXPECT_THROW` and friends to cover expected error cases explicitly.

### 8. Common Pitfalls

- Using `EXPECT_TRUE` with complex expressions produces poor failure diagnostics; prefer predicate assertions.
- Passing pointers to C strings with `EXPECT_EQ` tests pointer equality, not string content. Use `EXPECT_STREQ` instead.
- Using non-copyable objects in assertions can cause unexpected errors; write predicates or use custom printers.
- `EXPECT_THAT` requires `#include <gmock/gmock.h>`, not just GoogleTest headers.

## Examples

### Predicate Assertion with a Boolean Function

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }

TEST(MyTestSuite, IsEvenCheck) {
  int value = 4;
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);  // Passes

  value = 5;
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);  // Fails with value printed
}
```

### Predicate Assertion with `AssertionResult`

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AssertionResult;
using ::testing::AssertionSuccess;
using ::testing::AssertionFailure;

AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0) return AssertionSuccess();
  return AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, IsEvenDetailed) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(3));  // Failure message: "3 is odd"
}
```

### Using `EXPECT_THAT` with Matchers

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;

TEST(MyStringTest, MatcherExamples) {
  std::string hello = "Hello GoogleTest!";
  EXPECT_THAT(hello, StartsWith("Hello"));

  std::string line = "Line 123";
  EXPECT_THAT(line, MatchesRegex("Line \\d+"));

  int x = 7;
  EXPECT_THAT(x, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
}
```

### Floating-Point Near Equality

```cpp
TEST(MyFloatingTest, NearEquality) {
  double a = 1.0001;
  double b = 1.0002;

  EXPECT_NEAR(a, b, 0.001);  // Passes
  EXPECT_NEAR(a, b, 0.00001); // Fails
}
```

### Testing Exceptions

```cpp
TEST(MyExceptionTest, Throws) {
  EXPECT_THROW(throw std::runtime_error("error"), std::runtime_error);

  EXPECT_NO_THROW(int x = 5; (void)x;);
}
```

### Using `SCOPED_TRACE` for Context

```cpp
void CheckPositive(int n) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("Checking n = " + std::to_string(n));
  EXPECT_GT(n, 0);
}

TEST(TraceTest, CheckMultiple) {
  for (int i = -1; i <= 1; ++i) {
    CheckPositive(i);  // Failure message shows "Checking n = -1" etc.
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Assertion failure messages are not informative**: Use predicate assertions or matchers instead of plain `EXPECT_TRUE` or `EXPECT_EQ`.

- **Mismatch in string comparisons**: Remember that `EXPECT_EQ` on C strings checks pointer equality. Use `EXPECT_STREQ` for contents.

- **Floating-point failures due to precision**: Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR` instead of `EXPECT_EQ`.

- **Matcher assertions not compiling**: Include `<gmock/gmock.h>` and `using ::testing::` for needed matchers.

- **Fatal assertions in non-void functions cause compile errors**: Use `EXPECT_*` for non-fatal failures in non-void functions or refactor.

- **Unsafe side-effects in matchers or predicates**: Matchers must be pure functions; avoid side effects.

### Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with expressive matchers to clearly communicate intent.
- When writing custom assertions, prefer predicate-formatter assertions for customized failure messages.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to aid context when failures happen in helper functions or loops.
- Avoid excessive use of `ASSERT_*` unless a failure should abort the current function immediately.
