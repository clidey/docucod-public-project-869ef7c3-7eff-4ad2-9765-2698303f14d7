# Test Fixtures and Test Organization

## Overview

Effective test organization is essential for maintaining readable, reusable, and maintainable test code. **Test fixtures** help you organize and share common test setup and teardown code among multiple tests, reducing duplication and improving clarity.

This document guides you through creating and using test fixtures in GoogleTest, explaining their benefits, patterns, teardown practices, and hierarchical designs.

---

## Why Use Test Fixtures?

Imagine writing several tests that require setting up some common objects or state. Without shared setup, you would need to duplicate the initialization code in each test, making the tests harder to maintain and read. Test fixtures solve this by providing:

- **Shared Setup:** Common initialization code executed before each test.
- **Shared Teardown:** Common clean-up code executed after each test.
- **Encapsulation:** Grouping related tests in a logical class structure.

Using test fixtures means you write the setup/teardown code once, and all tests referencing the fixture inherit this behavior, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

## Creating a Test Fixture

1. **Define a Fixture Class**
   Derive a class from `testing::Test`. Prefer `protected` inheritance of members to allow sub-classes to reuse.

2. **Provide Setup and Teardown Code**
   Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` as needed.

3. **Declare Test Resources**
   Members declared inside the fixture class are accessible within your tests.

4. **Write Tests Using the Fixture**
   Use `TEST_F()` (the _F_ stands for _Fixture_) instead of `TEST()` to associate a test with a fixture.

### Basic Fixture Example

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple test fixture for a Queue class.
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Objects q1_ and q2_ are initialized before every test.
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  // You can optionally override SetUp and TearDown instead of constructor/destructor.
  void SetUp() override {
    // Additional setup, if needed.
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up, if needed.
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;  // Empty queue
  Queue<int> q1_;  // Contains 1 element
  Queue<int> q2_;  // Contains 2 elements
};

// Tests that a newly created queue is empty.
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

// Tests dequeue operation.
TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueRemovesElements) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);  // Dequeue on empty queue returns nullptr

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Notes:
- The fixture constructor (`QueueTest()`) runs before each test.
- TearDown runs after each test, allowing cleanup.
- Each test gets a **fresh** instance of the fixture.

## Fixture Setup and Teardown: Constructor vs. SetUp()

Both constructors/destructors and `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` can be used to manage test setup and teardown.

- **Constructor/Destructor:** Run before and after each test. Avoid throwing exceptions in constructors.
- **SetUp()/TearDown():** Preferred if setup or teardown could fail or require virtual method calls.

### Best Practices
- Use constructors for simple initialization.
- Use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for complex setup or when exceptions can be thrown.
- Define `override` keyword for clarity when overriding.

## Sharing Setup Across Test Suites

If multiple test suites need common setup or helper functions, consider:

- Using base fixture classes for shared functionality.
- Defining helper functions accessible across fixtures.

## Hierarchical Test Organization

Fixtures can be organized hierarchically to share setup code progressively:

```cpp
class BaseFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Base setup
  }
};

class DerivedFixture : public BaseFixture {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    BaseFixture::SetUp();
    // Additional setup
  }
};
```

Tests can then use `DerivedFixture` to gain access to both stable and specialized setup behavior.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Don't reuse the same fixture instance for multiple tests:** GoogleTest creates a new test fixture instance for each test. State changes in a test do not propagate to others.
- **Avoid heavy work in constructors that can fail:** Use `SetUp()` instead.
- **Confirm fixture destructors are virtual** to safely destroy polymorphic fixture objects.

## Practical Tips

- Name fixtures clearly to reflect their purpose.
- Keep fixture setup minimal and focused.
- Use `TEST_F` only with fixtures, and `TEST` for standalone tests without shared setup.
- Use inheritance or composition to extend fixtures wisely.

## Advanced Fixture Patterns

### Parameterized Fixtures
The document here focuses on fixtures for organizing common setup. For parameterized tests, see the GoogleTest [Parameterized Tests guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/advanced.html#parameterized-tests).

### Using SetUpTestSuite and TearDownTestSuite
GoogleTest allows static setup and teardown that run once per test suite by overriding `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`. Use these for expensive setup shared across all tests in the fixture.

```cpp
class ExpensiveFixture : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Runs once before all tests
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Runs once after all tests
  }
};
```

## Organizing Tests within Fixtures

- Group closely related tests under one fixture.
- Use descriptive test names to convey the specific behavior being tested.
- Prefer many small focused tests over fewer large ones.

## Summary

Using test fixtures in GoogleTest allows you to write maintainable test code by sharing setup and teardown code across multiple tests. By leveraging `TEST_F`, you associate tests with fixtures to access shared members and common initialization logic. Fixtures improve code clarity, reduce duplication, and enable hierarchical test design.

## Troubleshooting

### Fixture Setup Not Running
- Verify that the `SetUp()` method is spelled with capital `U`.
- Check that the test uses `TEST_F` and not `TEST` to correctly bind the fixture.

### Test State Leakage
- Remember that each test gets a fresh fixture; don't rely on state persisting across tests.

### Crashes Due to Non-Virtual Destructors
- Ensure fixture destructors are virtual if inheritance is used.

### Overly Complex Setup
- Break complex setup into helper functions or use multiple fixtures with inheritance.
