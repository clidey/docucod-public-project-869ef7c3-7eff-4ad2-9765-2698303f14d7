# Test Fixtures: Reusable Setups and Cleanups

## Overview

Test fixtures in GoogleTest allow you to write reusable code that sets up the environment your tests need, and cleans up afterward, enabling clean, maintainable, and isolated tests. This guide focuses on structuring your tests using fixtures to share common setup and teardown logic effectively.

---

## Why Use Test Fixtures?

Imagine you have several tests that all require the same initial conditions or objects to be instantiated. Without test fixtures, you'd have to repeat this setup code in every test, leading to duplication and error-prone maintenance. Test fixtures let you write this once and share it cleanly across many tests.

Key benefits include:

- Reducing code duplication by creating a common test environment.
- Ensuring tests are isolated and independent by creating fresh fixture instances for each test.
- Improving test readability and organization by separating setup logic from test logic.

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C++ and GoogleTest.
- GoogleTest installed and integrated with your project.
- Familiarity with writing simple tests using `TEST()` macro.

---

## What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will:

- Define test fixtures as subclasses of `testing::Test`.
- Implement setup and teardown phases using constructor/destructor and `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` methods.
- Write multiple tests reusing the fixture via `TEST_F()`.
- Understand how to share expensive resources between tests at various levels.
- Learn to avoid common pitfalls related to test fixtures.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Using Test Fixtures

### 1. Define a Test Fixture Class

Create a class derived from `testing::Test`, where you'll place setup and cleanup logic as well as member variables shared by tests.

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  // Constructor: good for simple initialization
  MyTestFixture() {
    // Initialization code
  }

  // Destructor: good for cleanup of resources
  ~MyTestFixture() override {
    // Cleanup code
  }

  // SetUp() is called immediately before each test
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code that must run before each test
  }

  // TearDown() is called immediately after each test
  void TearDown() override {
    // Code that must run after each test
  }

  // Shared objects for tests
  SomeClass* shared_object_ = nullptr;
};
```

**Tips**:
- Prefer initialization using constructor and cleanup using destructor when exceptions and fatal failures are not expected.
- Use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` if assertions or operations that might fail need to be performed.

### 2. Implement Setup and Teardown Logic

- Use the **constructor** for simple, no-fail initialization (e.g., setting default values).
- Use **`SetUp()`** to prepare the environment before each test (e.g., allocating memory, opening files), especially when you need to assert success.
- Use **`TearDown()`** to release resources or reset state after each test.
- Use **destructor** for cleanup that won't require assertions or failure handling.

**Important**: GoogleTest creates a new fixture for each test, so any mutation to fixture members is isolated.

### 3. Write Tests Using the Fixture

Instead of `TEST()`, use the `TEST_F()` macro which refers to your fixture class.

```cpp
TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestOne) {
  // Use fixture members
  ASSERT_NE(shared_object_, nullptr);
  // Test code goes here
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestTwo) {
  // Fresh fixture instance, unaffected by other tests
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_object_->IsValid());
}
```

The `TEST_F` macro associates your tests to the fixture, ensuring setup and cleanup are run automatically.

### 4. Sharing Expensive Resources Across Tests

If your tests require expensive setup (e.g., opening a database connection), you can share resources across the entire test suite:

```cpp
class ExpensiveResourceTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Runs once before first test
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Runs once after last test
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  // Shared resource pointer
  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* ExpensiveResourceTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(ExpensiveResourceTest, TestA) {
  ASSERT_NE(shared_resource_, nullptr);
  // Test using shared_resource_
}
```

This reduces overhead by setting up the resource once for all tests.

### 5. Running and Verifying Your Tests

Compile and run your tests normally. GoogleTest will automatically invoke fixture constructors, `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, and destructors as appropriate.

If a test fails within the fixture methods, GoogleTest reports failure with file and line information.

## Examples

### Simple Queue Test Fixture

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Setup initial state
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Runs before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Runs after each test
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;  // empty
  Queue<int> q1_;  // has one element
  Queue<int> q2_;  // has two elements
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Per-Test-Suite Setup Example

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Runs before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Runs after each test
  }

  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};

Resource* FooTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(FooTest, UsesSharedResource) {
  ASSERT_NE(shared_resource_, nullptr);
  // Use shared_resource_
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Misnaming `SetUp()` or `TearDown()`
GoogleTest requires exact capitalization: `SetUp` and `TearDown`. Misspellings like `Setup()` or `Teardown()` are ignored silently, causing setup or cleanup code never to run.

### Using Fatal Assertions in Constructors/Destructors
You cannot use fatal assertion macros (`ASSERT_*`) inside constructors or destructors because these are non-void-returning functions. Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for assertions.

### Sharing Mutable State Across Tests
Each test gets a fresh fixture instance, so mutable state is not shared unless using static variables and `SetUpTestSuite()`. Be careful to reset state if tests mutate shared resources.

### Mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` in Same Test Suite
All tests in one test suite must use the same fixture type. Mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` causes runtime errors.

### Skipping Tests in Fixtures
You can call `GTEST_SKIP()` inside `SetUp()` to skip all tests in that fixture conditionally.

```cpp
void SetUp() override {
  if (!IsSystemReady()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "Skipping tests: System not ready.";
  }
}
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- Prefer `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` over constructor/destructor when using assertions or when initialization can fail.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()`/`TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive shared resource setup.
- Keep fixtures focused: don’t put unrelated setup into the same fixture.
- Name your test fixtures and tests clearly to reflect their purpose.
