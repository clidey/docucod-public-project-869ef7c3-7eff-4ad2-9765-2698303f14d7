# Assertions and Best Practices

This guide helps you master the use of GoogleTest assertion macros, enabling you to write precise, maintainable, and expressive test checks. Understanding which assertion to use and how to write clear test expressions ensures reliable test outcomes and enhances debugging efficiency.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Task Description:** Learn how to effectively use GoogleTest assertions to verify code behavior, including simple checks, binary comparisons, predicate assertions, and advanced matcher-based assertions.
- **Prerequisites:** Familiarity with C++ basics, GoogleTest installation, and a sample or existing test codebase.
- **Expected Outcome:** Ability to choose appropriate assertions, write clear test expressions, customize assertion failure messages, and improve test diagnostics.
- **Time Estimate:** 30–45 minutes
- **Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Categories

Assertions in GoogleTest verify expectations in your test logic and come with two variants:

- **EXPECT_** variants: Non-fatal failures, test continues after failure.
- **ASSERT_** variants: Fatal failures, abort current test function upon failure.

Use these variants thoughtfully to balance immediate test termination against the ability to report multiple failures in a single test.

### Key Assertion Types

- **Boolean Conditions:** ASSERT_TRUE, EXPECT_TRUE, ASSERT_FALSE, EXPECT_FALSE
- **Binary Comparisons:** ASSERT_EQ, EXPECT_EQ (equality), ASSERT_NE, EXPECT_NE (inequality), ASSERT_LT, ASSERT_LE, ASSERT_GT, ASSERT_GE
- **String Comparisons:** ASSERT_STREQ, EXPECT_STREQ (C strings equality), ASSERT_STRNE, EXPECT_STRNE (C strings inequality), case-insensitive variants
- **Floating-point Comparisons:** ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ, EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ, ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ, EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ, ASSERT_NEAR, EXPECT_NEAR
- **Predicate Assertions:** ASSERT_PRED*, EXPECT_PRED*, ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT*, EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*
- **Exception Assertions:** ASSERT_THROW, EXPECT_THROW, ASSERT_NO_THROW, EXPECT_NO_THROW

---

## 2. Writing Effective Assertions

### 2.1 Choose the Most Specific Assertion

- Prefer `EXPECT_EQ`/`ASSERT_EQ` over `EXPECT_TRUE` with comparison expressions — this produces clearer failure messages.
- Use C-string specific assertions (`EXPECT_STREQ`) for comparing `const char*`, not `EXPECT_EQ`.

### 2.2 Stream Custom Failure Messages

Use `<<` to append detailed failure context, making issues easier to diagnose:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(ptr != nullptr) << "Pointer must not be null before use.";
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected) << "Mismatch in computation result.";
```

### 2.3 Avoid Side-Effects in Assertions

Assertions may be evaluated multiple times or in unknown order. Keep them free of side-effects to avoid flaky tests.

### 2.4 Assert on Important Checks Only

Too many assertions clutter the test and increase maintenance overhead. Focus on one logical check per test or assertion.

---

## 3. Binary Comparison Assertions

These macros compare two values using their relevant operators and print diagnostic information automatically:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2);  // Uses operator==
EXPECT_NE(val1, val2);  // Uses operator!=
EXPECT_LT(val1, val2);  // Uses operator<
EXPECT_LE(val1, val2);  // Uses operator<=
EXPECT_GT(val1, val2);  // Uses operator>
EXPECT_GE(val1, val2);  // Uses operator>=
```

### Notes:

- Use `EXPECT_EQ` for integral and user-defined types supporting `operator==`.
- For pointer equality, `EXPECT_EQ` compares addresses; use string-specific assertions for C strings.

---

## 4. String Comparison Assertions

For C-style strings (`const char*`), use the following instead of `EXPECT_EQ`, which compares pointers:

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2);  // Checks string content equality
EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2);  // Checks string content inequality
EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2); // Case-insensitive inequality
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2); // Case-insensitive equality
```

---

## 5. Floating-Point Comparison

Direct equality comparisons on floating-point values can be unreliable due to precision. Use these macros:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` for `float` values, allowing 4 ULP tolerance.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` for `double` values, similarly tolerant.
- Use `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` for custom absolute tolerances.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(computed_pi, 3.14159, 1e-5);
```

---

## 6. Boolean Assertions

Use these for straightforward truth checks:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition);
EXPECT_FALSE(condition);
```

Prefer these over composing complex expressions inside `EXPECT_EQ(true, expression)`.

---

## 7. Predicate Assertions

### 7.1 Basic Predicates

Use `EXPECT_PRED1`, `EXPECT_PRED2`, ..., `EXPECT_PRED5` to verify custom predicates:

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

### 7.2 Predicate Format Assertions

Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` for custom failure messages with detailed diagnostics:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsGreaterThan(const char* expr1, const char* expr2,
                                       int val1, int val2) {
  if(val1 > val2) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr1 << " (" << val1 << ")"
                                     << " is not greater than " << expr2
                                     << " (" << val2 << ")";
}
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(IsGreaterThan, a, b);
```

---

## 8. Exception Assertions

Verify exception behavior succinctly:

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, ExceptionType)` / `ASSERT_THROW`
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW`
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW`

These macros ensure exceptions are thrown or not as expected.

---

## 9. Using Matchers with Assertions

The powerful `EXPECT_THAT` syntax combines googletest with gMock matchers for expressive assertions:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, ::testing::StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(collection, ::testing::ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

Combine this with custom matchers for precise validations.

---

## 10. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use expressive assertions:** For clarity, favor specific assertions (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`) rather than generic `EXPECT_TRUE` checks.
- **Keep tests readable:** Write assertions that read like English sentences.
- **Fail fast when necessary:** Use `ASSERT_` for checks after which continuing the test is unsafe.
- **Balance between strictness and flexibility:** Don't over-constrain tests; only verify what matters.
- **Provide useful failure messages:** Use the `<<` stream operator to add context.
- **Use matchers for complex validations:** Avoid brittle exact comparisons on complex data; prefer matchers.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Using `EXPECT_EQ` on C strings compares pointers:** Switch to `EXPECT_STREQ` for content comparison.
- **Floating-point comparisons fail unexpectedly:** Switch to `EXPECT_NEAR` or `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`.
- **Tests fail due to too many or too few calls:** Review the assertions’ intent and clarify expectations.
- **Test failures flooding after refactor:** Review if assertions are too strict or order-dependent.

### Debugging Failures

- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` flag to trap failures in a debugger.
- Add descriptive messages to assertions to explain the context.

---

## 12. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Basic Equality Assertion

```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, SizeIsCorrect) {
  std::vector<int> v = {3, 1, 4};
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 3) << "Vector size should be 3 after initialization.";
}
```

### Example 2: Floating-Point Nearness Check

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, PiApproximation) {
  double computed_pi = ComputePi();
  EXPECT_NEAR(computed_pi, 3.14159, 1e-5) << "Pi approximation out of range.";
}
```

### Example 3: Using Predicate Formatter

```cpp
bool IsSorted(const std::vector<int>& v);

::testing::AssertionResult AssertSorted(const char* v_expr, 
                                       const std::vector<int>& v) {
  if(IsSorted(v)) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << v_expr << " is not sorted.";
}

TEST(SortTest, SortsCorrectly) {
  std::vector<int> data = {1, 3, 2};
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(AssertSorted, data);
}
```
