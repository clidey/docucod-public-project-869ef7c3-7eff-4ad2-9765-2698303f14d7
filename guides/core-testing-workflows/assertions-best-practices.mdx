# Assertions and Expectations: Best Practices

## Introduction

This guide empowers you to wield GoogleTest's rich assertions effectively and confidently. You'll learn how to differentiate between **fatal** and **non-fatal failures**, employ user-defined assertions to enhance test clarity, and apply best practices that maximize readability and reliability.

Whether you are writing simple checks or complex verification conditions, mastering assertions ensures your tests offer clear feedback and robust failure detection.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions and Expectations

### What They Are
- **Assertions** check if a condition is true or false within your test code. They produce failure messages when the check fails.
- **Expectations** are a form of non-fatal assertion, allowing tests to continue after failure to accumulate multiple issues.

### Fatal vs. Non-Fatal Failures
- **Fatal failures** (`ASSERT_*` macros) abort the current function execution immediately.
- **Non-fatal failures** (`EXPECT_*` macros) record the failure but allow the test function to continue.

Use fatal assertions when the rest of the test depends on the checked condition. Use non-fatal assertions when you want to gather multiple failures in one run.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(ExampleTest, AssertVsExpect) {
  int* ptr = nullptr;

  EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer should not be null, but continue test.";

  // This will cause a fatal failure and exit the function early
  ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer must not be null to proceed.";

  // This line won't run if ASSERT_NE above fails
  *ptr = 42;
}
```

<Tip>
Choose assertion types based on whether the test logic can proceed meaningfully after a failure.
</Tip>

## 2. Writing Clear, Helpful Assertions

### Use Rich Assertions Whenever Possible
GoogleTest provides many assertion macros that print detailed differences on failure, such as:
- `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)`
- `EXPECT_NE(unexpected, actual)`
- `EXPECT_LT(a, b)`
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`
- `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)`

Avoid general assertions that merely check `EXPECT_TRUE(complex_condition)` without informative feedback.

### Custom Failure Messages
To add context, stream a message to assertions:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Failed for input: " << input_value;
```

This makes failures easier to diagnose.

<Tip>
Adding inputs, expected states, or variable values in failure messages accelerates debugging.
</Tip>

### User-Defined Assertions for Complex Checks

For readability and reuse, write user-defined predicate functions returning `::testing::AssertionResult`. This offers:
- Clear success/failure signaling
- Custom failure explanations

#### Example

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even";
}

TEST(NumberTest, CheckEven) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4));  // Passes
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(3));  // Fails with message "3 is not even"
}
```

### Predicate Assertions for Better Messages

You can use GoogleTest's `EXPECT_PRED*` family of macros with predicate functions to benefit from automatic printing of input values.

```cpp
bool IsInRange(int x, int low, int high) {
  return x >= low && x <= high;
}

TEST(RangeTest, IsInRange) {
  EXPECT_PRED3(IsInRange, 5, 1, 10);  // passes
}
```

Alternatively, for full control, use predicate-formatter macros like `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`.

---

## 3. Best Practices for Assertion Placement and Propagation

### Avoid Fatal Assertions in Non-Void Functions
Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) can only be used in functions returning `void`. Using them in non-void functions leads to confusing compiler errors.

If you need fatal assertions in non-void functions, refactor the function to return via out-parameters instead.

### Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` to Propagate Fatal Failures

When calling helper functions containing fatal assertions, the failure aborts only the helper function, not the caller. To ensure the caller stops on failures, wrap calls like this:

```cpp
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(HelperFunction());
```

This macro verifies that the nested call did not generate any fatal failures.

### Check for Failures with `HasFatalFailure()`

You can programmatically determine if any fatal failure occurred during the current test and act accordingly.

```cpp
if (testing::Test::HasFatalFailure()) {
  // Handle cleanup or early return
  return;
}
```

---

## 4. Using Additional Logging in Assertions

Use `RecordProperty(key, value)` inside your tests to log custom key-value data, which appears in XML and JSON reports.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(WidgetTest, Usage) {
  int max_widgets = ComputeMaxWidgets();
  ::testing::Test::RecordProperty("max_widgets", max_widgets);
  EXPECT_GT(max_widgets, 0);
}
```

This enhances post-test analysis by recording metrics alongside the results.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

- **Silent Failures Due to Non-Propagated Fatal Failures**: Remember that `ASSERT_*` aborts only the current function. Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` or manually check `HasFatalFailure()` in callers.
- **Unclear Failure Messages**: Avoid plain `EXPECT_TRUE()` for complex conditions; create user-defined predicates returning `AssertionResult` for clear diagnostics.
- **Fatal Assertions in Constructors/Destructors**: Use `SetUp`/`TearDown` methods instead, as constructors/destructors cannot accommodate fatal assertions.
- **Duplicate Test Names in Parameterized Tests**: Always ensure unique parameter names when instantiating tests.

<Warning>
Avoid putting fatal assertions inside constructors or destructors — prefer `SetUp()` or `TearDown()`.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Fatal Assertion Does Not Stop Entire Test
Cause: `ASSERT_*` stops only the current function, not the whole test.

Solution:
- Wrap subroutine calls with `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE`.
- Check `HasFatalFailure()` after the call and return early if necessary.

### Compiler Errors Using Fatal Assertions in Non-Void Functions
Cause: `ASSERT_*` macros' fatal failures use `return;`, invalid in non-void functions.

Solution: Refactor the function to return `void` and use out-parameters for results.

### Obscure Failure Messages with `EXPECT_TRUE` on Complex Expressions
Cause: `EXPECT_TRUE()` prints only `true` or `false` without value context.

Solution: Use custom predicates returning `AssertionResult` or GoogleTest predicate macros for clearer errors.

# Practical Tips

- Favor `EXPECT_*` when subsequent checks don’t rely on prior ones.
- Prefer `ASSERT_*` when failure makes further checks invalid or dangerous.
- Use expressive matchers and user-defined predicates to improve failure diagnostics.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context when assertions are inside helpers.
- Avoid disabling tests; instead, fix or isolate them appropriately.
