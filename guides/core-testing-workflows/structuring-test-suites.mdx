# Organizing and Running Test Suites

Learn strategies for grouping, running, and managing collections of tests. This guide covers test discovery, suite organization, and best practices for structuring large codebases for maintainable testing.

## 1. Understanding Test Suites and Their Organization

**What this page helps you accomplish:**

- Master structuring your tests into logical suites.
- Learn how to group, discover, and execute test collections effectively.
- Discover strategies that scale for large codebases.

### What Is a Test Suite?

A test suite is a collection of related tests grouped together to reflect your code structure or testing intent. In GoogleTest and GoogleMock, test suites organize tests so they can share data, setup routines, and be run or reported as a unit.


### Why Organize Tests into Suites?

- **Maintains clarity:** Logical grouping improves readability and maintenance.
- **Reuses fixtures:** Set up common test data or environment once for all tests in the suite.
- **Facilitates selective running:** Run or disable specific suites without touching others.
- **Scales:** Enables handling thousands of tests without manual tracking.

<Info>
Effective test suite organization contributes to faster debugging, reduced test flakiness, and clearer test intent.

## 2. Principles of Test Suite Structuring

Your goals when structuring test suites are to keep suites meaningful and maintainable.

### Practical Strategies:

- **Reflect Code Structure:** Group tests to mirror your namespaces, classes, or functional areas.
- **Keep Suites Focused:** Avoid mixing unrelated tests; each suite should test a distinct unit or feature.
- **Limit Suite Size:** Too many tests in one suite can slow down feedback and debugging.
- **Use Fixtures Where Appropriate:** Share setup/teardown in suites that test related endpoints.

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, consistent suite names that convey intent.
- Avoid underscores or unconventional characters; use camel case or Pascal case.

### Examples:

```cpp
// Simple suite reflecting class name
TEST(MyClassTest, HandlesEmptyInput) { ... }

// Group related functionality
TEST(StringUtilsTest, TrimLeadingWhitespace) { ... }
TEST(StringUtilsTest, TrimTrailingWhitespace) { ... }
```

<Note>
The first argument to `TEST()` is the suite name; the second is the specific test's unique name within that suite.
</Note>


## 3. Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest and GoogleMock automatically discover all registered tests and suites.

Your responsibility is to structure and name suites and tests properly so discovery reflects your intent.

### Running Tests

- Use command line to run all tests:

  ```shell
  ./your_test_binary
  ```

- To run a specific suite:

  ```shell
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuiteName.*
  ```

- To run specific tests:

  ```shell
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuiteName.TestName
  ```

### Tips:

- You can disable specific tests or entire suites by prepending `DISABLED_` to their names.
- Use test flags to control verbosity, output formats, and filter tests.


## 4. Working with Large Codebases

When your project grows, so will the number of tests and suites. Follow these best practices:

### Best Practices

- **Modularize Suites:** Split large monolithic suites into smaller, feature-specific suites.
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Although GoogleTest does not support nested suites directly, use naming conventions (like prefixes) to create logical hierarchies.
- **Use Test Fixtures Wisely:** Share fixture code across related suites to reduce duplication.
- **Automate Test Runs:** Integrate test suites with CI/CD to track and run them consistently.

### Common challenges:

- **Test suite bloat:** Large suites slow down testing and obscure test failures.
- **Ordering dependencies:** Avoid test dependencies; use sequences or ordering clauses only when logically necessary.


## 5. Structuring Your Tests Using GoogleTest Patterns

GoogleTest provides macros and utilities to organize tests:

### TEST and TEST_F

- `TEST()` defines an independent test in a suite.
- `TEST_F()` uses a test fixture, sharing setup and teardown across tests.

Example:

```cpp
class VectorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { vec.push_back(1); }
  std::vector<int> vec;
};

TEST_F(VectorTest, HasOneElementInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(vec.size(), 1);
}

TEST_F(VectorTest, CanAddMoreElements) {
  vec.push_back(2);
  EXPECT_EQ(vec.size(), 2);
}
```

### Sequences for Ordered Expectations

You can enforce order of calls among mocks through the `Sequence` and `InSequence` API, ensuring that tests expecting specific call order succeed predictably.


## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Discovered

- Make sure all tests are linked into the test binary.
- Ensure test macros `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` are properly declared.

### Tests Not Running or Skipping

- Check if tests/suites are disabled with `DISABLED_` prefix.
- Filter flags might exclude tests.

### Slow Test Runs

- Split suites.
- Use parallel test execution if available.

### Running Specific Subsets

- Use `--gtest_filter=SuiteName.TestName`.

### Unexpected Test Failures Due to Ordering

- Use `InSequence` or `After` to specify ordering only when necessary.
- Prefer isolated, order-independent tests for maintainability.


## 7. Additional Tips and Tricks

- **Verbose Test Output:** Run with `--gtest_verbose=info` for detailed test run reports.
- **Grouping Tests by Tags:** Use custom naming conventions to tag suites and filter accordingly.
- **Mock Interaction Within Suites:** Use GoogleMock mocks within suites to validate interactions.


## 8. Summary

Organizing and running test suites effectively is key for scalable, maintainable, and fast testing. By reflecting your code structure in test suites, using fixtures and sequences appropriately, and leveraging GoogleTest's discovery and filtering features, you can optimize your testing workflow—even in large and complex C++ projects.
