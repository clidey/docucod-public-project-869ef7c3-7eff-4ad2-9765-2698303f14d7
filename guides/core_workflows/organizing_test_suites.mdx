# Organizing Test Suites and Fixtures

## Discover the Best Practices for Structuring Your Tests

As your C++ code base grows, maintaining clean, scalable, and effective tests becomes critical. This guide helps you master how to organize your tests using **test suites**, **fixtures**, and **naming conventions** within GoogleTest. By structuring tests logically and leveraging fixtures smartly, you can make test cases easier to maintain, understand, and extend.

---

## Workflow Overview

- **Task**: Learn to organize your tests effectively by grouping related tests into test suites and structuring common setup/teardown logic using test fixtures.
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with basic GoogleTest testing macros (`TEST()`, `TEST_F()`), and understanding test definition and execution.
- **Expected Outcome**: You will be able to write well-structured tests that share common resources and logic, while following GoogleTest best practices to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
- **Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes
- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate

## Organizing Tests: From Test Cases to Test Suites

### What is a Test Suite?

A **test suite** is a collection of related tests grouped together. In GoogleTest:

- Each **test suite** corresponds conceptually to a component, class, or function you want to test.
- Tests within a suite share a logical context, but by default they do **not share** data or subroutines directly unless you provide a test fixture.

### Test Suites Naming

- Use clear, concise names that represent the module or class under test.
- Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names to prevent naming collisions and reserved keyword conflicts. For details, see [FAQ: Why should test suite names and test names not contain underscore?](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)

### Defining Tests in a Test Suite

Use the `TEST` macro:

```cpp
TEST(MyClassTest, DoesThis) {
  // Test code...
}

TEST(MyClassTest, DoesThat) {
  // Test code...
}
```

These two tests belong to the same suite `MyClassTest`.

## Sharing Common Setup with Test Fixtures

A **test fixture** allows you to **re-use setup and teardown logic and common test utilities** between multiple tests in the same suite.

### Creating a Test Fixture

1. Derive a class from `testing::Test`.
2. Add data members and helper functions to manage the common test context.
3. Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for per-test initialization and cleanup.
4. Optionally include `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` for suite-level one-time setup and cleanup.

Example:

```cpp
class MyClassTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Runs before each test
    resource_ = new Resource();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Runs after each test
    delete resource_;
  }

  // Suite-level setup
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Runs once before first test in suite
  }

  // Suite-level teardown
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Runs once after last test in suite
  }

  Resource* resource_;
};
```

### Using a Test Fixture

Use `TEST_F` macro where the first parameter is the fixture class name:

```cpp
TEST_F(MyClassTest, DoesWork) {
  ASSERT_TRUE(resource_->IsReady());
  // Your test code...
}

TEST_F(MyClassTest, HandlesEdgeCase) {
  // resource_ is available here too
}
```

Each test:

- Creates a fresh fixture object
- Calls `SetUp()`
- Runs test body
- Calls `TearDown()`
- Deletes the fixture object

This guarantees isolation and repeatability.

## Naming Conventions and Best Practices

- **Test and Test Suite Names**:
  - Use descriptive names that express what is being tested.
  - Avoid underscores (`_`) to prevent clashes and reserved keyword issues.
  - Follow C++ naming conventions consistent with your codebase.

- **Test Fixture Class Naming**:
  - Name fixtures to clearly relate to the tested component, e.g., `MyClassTest`.

- **Prefix Temporary Disable Tests**:
  - Add `DISABLED_` before a test name or suite if temporarily disabling it.

- **Use Suite-Level Setup for Expensive Resources**:
  - Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for resources expensive to create for each test.

- **Keep Tests Independent**:
  - Avoid sharing non-const state where possible.
  - Restore any global or shared state modified during a test to avoid flaky tests.

---

## Advanced Structures: Parameterized and Typed Tests (Overview)

For more scalable and reusable testing patterns, GoogleTest offers:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**: Run the same test logic multiple times with different input values.
- **Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)**: Run tests over multiple types to verify interface conformance.

These advanced tests rely on fixtures and proper structuring but are covered in detail in separate guides.

---

## Practical Example

```cpp
// Define the fixture
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Setup runs before each test
    q_.Enqueue(42);
  }

  Queue<int> q_;
};

// Tests using the fixture
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsNotEmpty) {
  EXPECT_GT(q_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsValue) {
  int* val = q_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 42);
  delete val;
  EXPECT_EQ(q_.size(), 0);
}
```

Here:
- Fixture `QueueTest` initializes a queue with one element before each test.
- Each test runs isolated, on a fresh queue instance.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Tips">
<Accordion title="Test Fixture's SetUp Not Called">
Make sure the method is spelled exactly as `SetUp()` (uppercase 'U'). Using `Setup()` will prevent GoogleTest from calling it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Fixtures Must Have Default Constructor">
GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance for each test. Your fixture class must have an accessible default constructor. If you define custom constructors, explicitly add one without parameters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Share State Unexpectedly">
Avoid using global or static mutable variables without careful synchronization and resetting state between tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why Are My Tests Not Running?">
Verify your test suite and test names follow naming conventions. Also, ensure that tests are correctly registered, and your build includes test files.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for expensive shared resources to reduce test overhead.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not modify shared state in tests without restoring it, as test order is undefined and tests run independently.
</Warning>
