# Structuring and Organizing Test Suites

Efficiently structuring and organizing tests is essential for writing maintainable, scalable, and readable test code. This guide helps you design your GoogleTest test suites and cases systematically, demonstrating best practices for grouping, naming, sharing resources, and parameterizing tests to handle diverse C++ testing scenarios.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Suites and Tests

### What You Will Achieve
- Learn how to logically group tests into suites reflecting your code structure.
- Understand the relationship between tests, test fixtures, and test suites.
- Apply naming conventions that improve test clarity.

### Background
In GoogleTest, a **Test Suite** is a container for multiple related tests that verify different aspects of the same component or feature. Organizing tests into suites helps isolate functionality and share setup or teardown logic through fixtures.

A **Test** is an individual case verifying a specific behavior within the suite. Tests can be simple (`TEST`) or fixture-based (`TEST_F`).

### Why it Matters
Proper suite organization lets you run, debug, and maintain tests efficiently. It ensures clarity when test failures occur and scales well as your codebase grows.

---

## 2. Best Practices for Grouping and Naming Tests

### Workflow

1. **Group tests by functionality or class tested**. For example, all tests for a `Calculator` class belong in a `CalculatorTest` suite.
2. **Use `TEST` for independent tests** that do not share state.
3. **Use `TEST_F` with fixtures** to share common setup/teardown logic.
4. **Choose clear, descriptive names** for both test suites and tests, avoiding underscores.

### Detailed Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Define test suite names clearly and meaningfully">
Use the component or class name as the test suite name, ending with "Test". For example, `MatrixTest` for tests concerning the `Matrix` class.
</Step>
<Step title="Choose descriptive test names within suites">
Name tests according to the behavior they verify, e.g., `HandlesZeroSize`, `MultipliesCorrectly`. These names will appear in test output for easy identification of failures.
</Step>
<Step title="Group related tests with common setup using fixtures">
Create a test fixture by inheriting from `testing::Test`. Place shared variables or helper functions here.
Example:
```cpp
class StackTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Stack<int> stack_;

  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize with some common state
    stack_.push(1);
  }
};
```
</Step>
<Step title="Write tests within the fixture using TEST_F">
Use `TEST_F(StackTest, PopsElement)` syntax. Each test gets a fresh fixture instance.

```cpp
TEST_F(StackTest, PopsElement) {
  EXPECT_EQ(stack_.pop(), 1);
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Avoid using underscores in test suite or test names">
GoogleTest recommends using camel case for better compatibility with filtering and output parsing.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Outcome
You will have well-named, logically grouped test suites that map intuitively to your codebase.

## 3. Sharing Setup and Teardown Code with Fixtures

### What are Fixtures?
Test fixtures allow you to define common data and setup/teardown logic shared by multiple tests within a test suite.

### How to Use Fixtures

1. Inherit a class from `testing::Test`.
2. Add member variables representing shared test data.
3. Override `SetUp()` to prepare common state before each test.
4. Override `TearDown()` to clean up after each test if necessary.

Example:
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Database db_;

  void SetUp() override {
    db_.Connect();
    db_.ClearData();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db_.Disconnect();
  }
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_.Insert("Key", "Value"));
}
```

### Best Practices
- When expensive resources are used, consider using `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` static functions to set up shared state once per suite.
- Keep tests independent; do not let tests rely on state changes made by other tests.
- Use fixtures to reduce code duplication and improve readability.

## 4. Leveraging Parameterized Tests for Scalability

When you want to run the same logic with different inputs/parameters, **parameterized tests** are your solution.

### Types of Parameterized Tests in GoogleTest

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**: Run the same test logic with different parameter values.
- **Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)**: Run the same test logic over multiple types.

### Setting Up Value-Parameterized Tests

1. Define a fixture inheriting from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the parameter type.

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};
```

2. Write tests using `TEST_P` macro, accessing the parameter with `GetParam()`.

```cpp
TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(Factorial(n), 0);
}
```

3. Instantiate the test suite with parameters using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Values, FactorialTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 8));
```

### Typed Tests

Useful when the same tests apply to differently typed classes or templates.

1. Define a fixture template derived from `testing::Test`.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_ = T(0);
};
```

2. Register types and tests using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`.

```cpp
using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, IsZeroInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, 0);
}
```

### Tips
- Use parameterized tests to avoid test code duplication.
- Give meaningful names to instantiations to help identify parameter sets.
- Ensure parameters cover edge cases and typical use cases.

## 5. Organizing Large Test Suites for Maintenance

### Strategies

- **Modularize tests** by splitting large test suites into multiple smaller suites based on functionality or components.
- **Use nested test fixtures** or base fixtures for sharing common test infrastructure across suites.
- **Leverage parameterized testing** to consolidate repetitive tests.

### Example
```cpp
class SortingTest : public testing::Test {};

TEST_F(SortingTest, SortsEmptyVector) {
  //...
}

TEST_F(SortingTest, SortsVectorWithOneElement) {
  //...
}

// Use parameterized tests for different input sizes
class SortingParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::vector<int>> {};

TEST_P(SortingParamTest, SortsCorrectly) {
  std::vector<int> input = GetParam();
  Sort(input);
  EXPECT_TRUE(std::is_sorted(input.begin(), input.end()));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(SortingTests, SortingParamTest,
                         testing::Values(std::vector<int>{},
                                         std::vector<int>{1, 2},
                                         std::vector<int>{3, 1, 2}));
```

### Outcomes
In large projects, separating tests into manageable units reduces complexity and improves parallel test execution and reporting.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Organizational Issues

### Problem: Tests Affect Each Other (Flakiness)
- **Cause**: Shared mutable state in fixtures.
- **Solution**: Make fixtures reset state in `SetUp()` or use `SetUpTestSuite()` only for immutable shared resources.

### Problem: Confusing Test Names
- **Cause**: Non-descriptive or ambiguous names.
- **Solution**: Rename tests to clearly indicate the scenario being tested.

### Problem: Tests Not Running as Expected
- **Cause**: Syntax errors using `TEST` vs `TEST_F` or missing fixture class.
- **Solution**: Confirm macro usage matches fixture setup. Ensure test suite and fixture class names align.

### Debugging Tips
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` flag to see registered tests.
- Use filtering (`--gtest_filter`) to isolate test runs.
- Check fixture construction and destruction order.
