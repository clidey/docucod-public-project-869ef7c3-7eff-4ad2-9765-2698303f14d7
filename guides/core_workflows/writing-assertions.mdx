# Writing Powerful Assertions

Master advanced and custom assertions for thorough test coverage. Learn the distinction between fatal and non-fatal failures, get strategies for combining assertions, and see real-world patterns for effective verification.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Types

Assertions are the cornerstone of validating behavior in GoogleTest. This page will guide you through writing powerful assertions that make your tests both expressive and robust.

### 1.1 Fatal vs Non-Fatal Failures

GoogleTest provides two classes of assertions:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_`)**: On failure, these abort the current test function immediately. Use these when continued execution after a failure does not make sense.

- **Non-Fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_`)**: On failure, these log the failure but allow the test function to continue. Use these when you want to check multiple conditions within the same test function.

**Example:**

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr) << "Pointer must not be null."; // Aborts test on failure
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Values mismatched."; // Logs failure but continues
```

**Tip:** Prefer `EXPECT_` assertions when you want to collect and report multiple failures in a single test run to get more comprehensive feedback.

## 2. Crafting Effective Assertions

### 2.1 Basic Assertion Macros

GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertion macros to test values, strings, exceptions, and floating-point numbers. Here are some core categories:

- Boolean Checks: `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`, `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)`
- Equality Checks: `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`, `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`
- Comparison Checks: `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE`
- String Checks: `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` (C-strings), `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, etc.
- Floating-Point: `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`
- Exception Assertions: `EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW`

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(5, Add(2, 3));
EXPECT_STREQ("Hello", GetGreeting().c_str());
EXPECT_NEAR(3.1415, CalculatePi(), 0.0001);
```

### 2.2 Using Matchers with `EXPECT_THAT`

`EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` lets you write expressive assertions with built-in or custom matchers.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>  // For matchers

EXPECT_THAT(name, ::testing::StartsWith("John"));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, ::testing::ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
EXPECT_THAT(text, ::testing::MatchesRegex("Line \d+"));
```

Matchers allow granular and descriptive validation beyond simple equality.

---

## 3. Combining Multiple Assertions

Sometimes your test logic requires verifying several conditions together.

### 3.1 Independent Assertions

Use multiple `EXPECT_` to validate each property, allowing all checks to report.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result.size(), expected_size);
EXPECT_TRUE(result.contains(expected_element));
```

### 3.2 Conditional Assertions

Use fatal assertions to guard subsequent dependent assertions.

```cpp
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer must not be null.";
EXPECT_EQ(ptr->value, expected_value);
```

The first assertion ensures it is safe to dereference `ptr`.

### 3.3 Custom Predicates

For more complex validations, use `EXPECT_PRED`, `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT` or define custom matchers.

```cpp
bool IsValidRange(int a, int b) { return a < b && a >= 0; }
EXPECT_PRED2(IsValidRange, actual_start, actual_end);
```

---

## 4. Advanced Assertion Patterns

### 4.1 Using `SUCCEED()` and `FAIL()`

- `SUCCEED()` explicitly generates a test success, useful as documentation or checkpoints.
- `FAIL()` generates a fatal failure immediately within a `void` function.

```cpp
if (unexpected_case)
  FAIL() << "Unexpected condition encountered.";
```

### 4.2 Adding Failure Messages

Append explanatory messages to all assertions with stream syntax to improve diagnostics.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(x, y) << "Mismatch during calculation of " << operation_name;
```

### 4.3 Death Tests Assertions

Verify that code terminates as expected using `EXPECT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_EXIT`, and related macros.

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(SomeFunction(), "Error.*failure");
EXPECT_EXIT(Process(), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "Success");
```

Important: Death tests spawn subprocesses and may differ across platforms.

## 5. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Use non-fatal (`EXPECT_`) assertions when multiple checks are desired in one test to get complete feedback.**
- **Use fatal (`ASSERT_`) assertions to guard code that depends on critical conditions.**
- **Prefer expressive matchers instead of hand-crafted boolean expressions for clearer output.**
- **Avoid overly strict assertions that bind tests to implementation details.**
- **Always append failure messages to clarify intent when possible.**
- **Beware of side effects: assertion macros evaluate their arguments exactly once, but avoid complex expressions with side effects in matchers.**

---

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

### 6.1 Unexpected Test Failures

- Check failure reports to understand which assertion failed and why.
- Use `--gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe` for more reliable death tests on some platforms.
- Run tests with `--gtest_repeat=10` to catch flaky failures.

### 6.2 Ambiguous Matcher Errors

- Specify explicit types or use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(matcher)` when matching arguments with type ambiguity.

### 6.3 No Output on Some Failures

- Ensure that assertion macros are not placed inside functions that don't return void if using `FAIL()` or `ASSERT_DEATH`.

## 7. Examples

### 7.1 Basic Assertions

```cpp
TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  int sum = Add(2, 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(sum, 5) << "Sum should be 5";
  EXPECT_TRUE(sum > 0);
}
```

### 7.2 Combining Assertions with Custom Predicate

```cpp
bool IsSorted(const std::vector<int>& v) {
  return std::is_sorted(v.begin(), v.end());
}

TEST(VectorTest, IsSortedCheck) {
  std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4};
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsSorted, data) << "Vector is not sorted.";
}
```

### 7.3 Matching Multiple Arguments as a Whole

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Lt;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Range(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // Checks first arg < second arg
```

### 7.4 Using ASSERT and EXPECT Together

```cpp
TEST(FileTest, CanOpenFile) {
  FILE* file = fopen("test.txt", "r");
  ASSERT_NE(file, nullptr) << "File not found";
  char buffer[100];
  int read = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof(buffer), file);
  EXPECT_GT(read, 0) << "File is empty.";
  fclose(file);
}
```
