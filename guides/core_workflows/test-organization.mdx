# Organizing and Running Large Test Suites

GoogleTest is designed to work seamlessly with test suites of all sizes, including very large ones containing thousands of tests. This guide helps you structure your test code, manage large volumes of tests efficiently, select and filter tests for execution, and leverage test discovery features to scale testing workflows gracefully.

---

## 1. Overview of Managing Large Test Suites

### Purpose of This Guide
Understand best practices for organizing large collections of test code into meaningful test suites, grouping related tests, and effectively running subsets of tests.

### Prerequisites
- You have GoogleTest integrated into your project.
- Basic familiarity with writing tests using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and test fixtures.
- Ability to build and run your test executable.

### Expected Outcomes
- Learn how to organize tests into suites and fixtures that reflect logical structures.
- Understand how to run full test suites or selective subsets via filtering.
- Use test discovery and command-line options to improve workflow efficiency.

### Estimated Time
About 15-30 minutes to implement organizational strategies and learn filtering mechanisms.

### Skill Level
Intermediate - assumes knowledge of basic GoogleTest usage.

## 2. Structuring and Grouping Tests

### Group Tests Using Test Suites
- Group logically related tests into named test suites by providing the first argument in the `TEST()` macro.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
  }

  TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  }
  ```
- This groups tests handling factorial logic within `FactorialTest` suite.

### Reuse Setup With Test Fixtures
- For shared setup or objects, use test fixtures via `TEST_F()`:
  1. Create a fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
  2. Define the shared members and setup logic.
  3. Write tests using `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)`.

- Example:
  ```cpp
  class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
  protected:
    Queue<int> queue_;

    void SetUp() override {
      queue_.Enqueue(42);
    }
  };

  TEST_F(QueueTest, StartsNotEmpty) {
    EXPECT_NE(queue_.Dequeue(), nullptr);
  }
  ```
- This keeps your tests clean and reduces redundancy.

### Handle Thousands of Tests
- GoogleTest supports defining many tests in a single source file (e.g., thousands as in `gtest_test_macro_stack_footprint_test.cc`).
- Consider splitting large groups into multiple source files to manage compilation times and improve maintainability.

## 3. Selecting and Filtering Tests to Run

### Running All Tests
- The default behavior of the test binary is to run all registered tests.
  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

### Filtering by Test Name
- Use the `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable to run subsets:
  ```shell
  ./my_tests --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*  # Runs all tests in FactorialTest suite

  ./my_tests --gtest_filter=*PositiveInput* # Runs tests with 'PositiveInput' in full test name

  ./my_tests --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*-FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput  # Runs all except HandlesZeroInput
  ```
- Filter format: Positive patterns (colon-separated) optionally followed by `-` and negative patterns.

### Running Disabled Tests
- Prefix a test name or suite with `DISABLED_` to disable it temporarily.
- To run disabled tests, add the flag `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

### Listing Available Tests
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to display all test suites and test names without running.
  ```shell
  ./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
  ```

### Stopping on First Failure
- Use `--gtest_fail_fast` to halt test execution if any failure occurs.

### Repeating Tests
- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to run all tests N times, useful for detecting flaky tests.
- To repeat infinitely, set `N = -1`.

### Shuffling Test Order
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order each run.
- Control seed via `--gtest_random_seed=SEED` to reproduce order.

---

## 4. Leveraging Test Discovery and Runtime Registration

### Automatic Test Registration
- Tests defined via `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` automatically register themselves when compiled.
- No need to manually list or register tests.

### Dynamic Test Registration
- Use `RegisterTest()` API to programmatically add tests at runtime before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Useful for tests that depend on runtime parameters or configurations.

### Organized Test Hierarchy
- Tests are organized as suites containing multiple tests.
- GoogleTest runs each test independently with fresh fixtures, enhancing isolation and reliability.

---

## 5. Advanced Test Suite Strategies for Large Codebases

### Value-Parameterized Tests
- Write one set of tests running over multiple input values.
- Define with `TEST_P()` and instantiate with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

  TEST_P(MyParamTest, RunsOnParams) {
    int param = GetParam();
    EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
  }

  INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyGroup, MyParamTest, testing::Values(1,2,3));
  ```
- Great for testing across many inputs without repeating code.

### Typed Tests
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` and `TYPED_TEST()` to run the same test logic on different types.
- Useful when verifying multiple implementations of the same interface.

### Sharding for Parallel Test Execution
- Set environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to split test execution across machines.
- GoogleTest ensures each test runs on exactly one shard.

## 6. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Pitfalls
- **Test Suite and Test Names:** Avoid using underscores (`_`) in test suite or test names to prevent conflicts and unexpected behavior.
- **Fixture Constructors:** Ensure test fixture classes have default constructors as GoogleTest creates fixtures dynamically.

### Tips for Efficient Large Suite Management
- Group related tests logically into suites to simplify filtering.
- Use test fixtures to avoid duplicated setup code.
- Use test filtering during development to focus on small subsets.
- Employ test shuffling and repeating to identify flaky tests.

### Performance Considerations
- Splitting very large suites across files reduces compile-time and improves parallel build.
- Use shared resources carefully; mutable shared state can cause test flakiness.

## Example: Filtering Tests

Run only tests from `QueueTest` except for `EmptyTest`:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_filter=QueueTest.*-QueueTest.EmptyTest
```

List all available tests:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
```

Run all tests 10 times, shuffled with a fixed seed:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_repeat=10 --gtest_shuffle --gtest_random_seed=12345
```
