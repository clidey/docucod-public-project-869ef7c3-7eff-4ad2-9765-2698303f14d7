# Writing Maintainable and Robust Tests

Create tests that stand the test of time. This guide delivers practical strategies to develop test code that remains reliable, clear, and adaptable as your codebase expands. It focuses on naming conventions, code reuse, minimizing test flakiness, and using advanced GoogleTest and GoogleMock features thoughtfully.

---

## Why Maintainable Tests Matter

Imagine you’re working on a growing C++ project. Your tests ideally should help catch regressions quickly, be easy to understand by others (and future you), and minimize costly false alarms. Writing maintainable and robust tests means:

- **Clarity:** Test intentions are explicit and easy to grasp.
- **Reusability:** Avoid repeating code; set up shared functionality smartly.
- **Stability:** Resist flaky failures that waste time.
- **Scalability:** Tests remain manageable with complex projects.

This guide helps you design your tests to embody these qualities.

---

## 1. Naming Tests and Test Fixtures

Clear, consistent names make your tests self-documenting.

### Best Practices

- Use the `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros with descriptive names.
- Name test suites (fixtures) after the class or behavior under test.
- Name test cases to describe the behavior being verified, preferably "[MethodUnderTest]_[Condition]_[ExpectedResult]".

### Example
```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, PushBack_IncreasesSize) {
  std::vector<int> v;
  v.push_back(5);
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 1);
}

class StackTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { stack_.push(1); }
  std::stack<int> stack_;
};

TEST_F(StackTest, Top_ReturnsLastPushedItem) {
  EXPECT_EQ(stack_.top(), 1);
}
```

<Note>
Good names allow you and others to understand test intentions without reading the implementation.
</Note>

## 2. Reusing Code with Test Fixtures and Helper Functions

Avoid duplicating test setup and teardown code.

### Using Fixtures

Define `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods in a test fixture (class derived from `::testing::Test`) to share preparation and cleanup steps.

### Writing Helper Functions

Extract commonly used assertions, mock setups, or test data into reusable functions.

### Example
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db_.Connect();
    PrepareTestData();
  }
  void PrepareTestData() {
    db_.Insert({"name", "test"});
  }
  Database db_;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, Query_ReturnsExpectedResults) {
  EXPECT_EQ(db_.Query("SELECT name"), "test");
}
```

<Tip>
Extract repetitive mock expectations into helper functions to keep tests focused on their unique behavior.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Minimizing Flakiness in Tests

Flaky tests generate random failures unrelated to code correctness. Avoiding them boosts trust in your test suite.

### Common Causes and Fixes

- **Shared mutable state:** Use fixtures to reset state before each test.
- **Order dependencies:** Write tests to be independent and avoid fixed execution order reliance.
- **Unstable timing:** Avoid using sleep or real-time delays; use mocks or simulate time when possible.

### GoogleTest Tips

- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` to reset global or static state.
- Use GoogleMock to replace flaky external dependencies with deterministic mock objects.

<Warning>
Flaky tests cost time and reduce confidence. Invest time upfront to make tests resilient.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Balancing Test Strictness and Flexibility

Set expectations precisely but avoid over-constraining tests.

### Use ON_CALL Wisely

- `ON_CALL` specifies default mock behaviors without enforcing that calls happen.
- Use it in test fixtures to establish common default behaviors.

### Use EXPECT_CALL to Verify Critical Interactions

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only on mock methods where call verification matters.
- Avoid expecting every possible call — restrict to what's necessary.

### Use NiceMock and StrictMock Judiciously

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock` to enforce no unexpected calls.
- Most cases prefer `NiceMock` for maintainability.

### Example
```cpp
class MockDatabase : public DatabaseInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, UsesDatabase) {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;
  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1);

  MyClass obj(&mock_db);
  obj.Initialize();
}
```

---

## 5. Structuring Tests for Readability and Maintenance

Logical and consistent structuring reduces the friction of adding or updating tests.

### Test Case Structure

Each test should follow a clear arrange-act-assert pattern:

- **Arrange:** Setup test data and test doubles.
- **Act:** Exercise the code under test.
- **Assert:** Verify outcomes using assertions.

### Use Parameterized Tests for Similar Cases

Leverage `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to avoid duplication when testing multiple input/output variants.

### Example
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::pair<int, int>> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ReturnsExpectedValue) {
  auto [input, expected] = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(input), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ValidInputs, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(
  std::make_pair(0, 1),
  std::make_pair(1, 1),
  std::make_pair(5, 120)));
```

---

## 6. Using Advanced GoogleTest Features Judiciously

Advanced features increase power but can add complexity.

### Sequencing Expectations

Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to enforce call ordering only when order matters:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Initialize());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Run());
}
```

### Retiring Expectations

Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations that should deactivate automatically once met.

### Custom Matchers & Actions

Define them sparingly and only to clarify intent or reduce repetitive code.

<Note>
Advanced features are best introduced after basic test structuring and mocking skills are in place.
</Note>

## 7. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Setting Expectations After Calling Mock Methods

Always set `EXPECT_CALL` before calling mock methods. Setting expectations afterward produces undefined behavior.

### Mocking Non-Virtual Methods

Only virtual methods can be mocked by default. For non-virtuals, consider redesign or testing alternatives.

### Overly Strict Expectations

Avoid specifying exact argument values unless critical, to prevent brittle tests.

### Ignoring Uninteresting Calls

If you expect that some mock functions may be called but don’t care about those calls, don’t write explicit `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` just to suppress warnings; instead, use `NiceMock` to reduce noise.

---

## 8. Verifying and Resetting Mocks Manually

Sometimes you want to verify mocks before their destruction or reuse mocks.

### Functions

- `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(mock_object);` verifies and clears expectations.
- `Mock::VerifyAndClear(mock_object);` also clears default actions.
- `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_object);` skips verification and suppresses leak warnings.

### Example
```cpp
MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething());
// Exercise code...
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
// Now mock can be reused or destroyed safely.
```

## 9. Sample Template for a Maintainable Test

```cpp
class MockWidget : public WidgetInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Draw, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetCount, (), (const, override));
};

class WidgetTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    ON_CALL(mock_widget_, GetCount()).WillByDefault(Return(10));
  }

  NiceMock<MockWidget> mock_widget_;
};

TEST_F(WidgetTest, Draw_InvokesDrawOnce) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_widget_, Draw()).Times(1);

  // Exercise SUT
  sut_.Render();
}

TEST_F(WidgetTest, GetCount_ReturnsDefaultValue) {
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_widget_.GetCount(), 10);
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you see "Uninteresting mock function call" warnings, decide if you want to suppress them with `NiceMock` or by specifying the appropriate `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces of mock calls and matchings.
- When tests fail due to too many calls, verify that `.RetiresOnSaturation()` is used appropriately.
- If tests fail mysteriously, check that all expectations are set before exercising the mocks.
- Use Google Mock's output messages to pinpoint argument mismatches or order problems.
