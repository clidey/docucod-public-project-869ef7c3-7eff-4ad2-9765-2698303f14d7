## 1. Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Achieve
By following this guide, you will gain practical knowledge to:
- Use GoogleTest assertions to verify boolean conditions, equality, string and floating-point comparisons, exceptions, and complex predicates with clarity.
- Select the most effective assertion macros that match your testing goals.
- Understand assertion failure outputs to make your tests more robust and easily diagnosable.

## 2. Assertion Categories and When to Use Them

GoogleTest provides many assertion macros intended for different testing scenarios. Select assertions to express your test intent clearly and receive the most informative feedback.

### 2.1 Boolean Condition Assertions
Use when you want to assert a simple true or false condition.
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` — Verify condition is true.
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` — Verify condition is false.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_initialized());
ASSERT_FALSE(error_occurred());
```

### 2.2 Equality and Inequality Assertions
Use to check if two values are equal or not.
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Verifies `val1 == val2`.
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)` — Verifies `val1 != val2`.

**Important:** For C-strings, use string-specific comparators like `EXPECT_STREQ` since `EXPECT_EQ` compares pointer addresses.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value);
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr);
```

### 2.3 String Assertions
Used specifically for C-style string comparisons.
- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)` — Compare string contents.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)` — Verify contents are different.
- Case-insensitive variants: `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASENE`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(message.c_str(), "Success");
```

### 2.4 Floating-Point Comparisons
Due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, use specialized assertions to handle small precision errors.
- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Check approximate equality for `float` within 4 ULPs.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` — Likewise for `double`.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` / `ASSERT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` — Check if values are within absolute error bounds.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated_pi, 3.14159, 0.0001);
```

### 2.5 Exception Assertions
Used to verify code throws or does not throw exceptions.
- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, ExceptionType)` / `ASSERT_THROW(statement, ExceptionType)` — Check that `statement` throws the specified exception.
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW(statement)` — Check if any exception is thrown.
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW(statement)` — Check that no exception is thrown.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(processData(nullptr), std::invalid_argument);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(processData(valid_input));
```

### 2.6 Predicate Assertions
Use to evaluate custom boolean conditions or predicates with clear error messages.
- Basic predicates: `EXPECT_PRED1`, `EXPECT_PRED2`, ..., `ASSERT_PREDn`.
- Advanced predicate formatters: `EXPECT_PRED_FORMATn` allow for detailed failure message customization.

**Example:**
```cpp
bool IsPositive(int n) { return n > 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, value);
```

### 2.7 Explicit Success and Failure
Use when you want to unconditionally report success or failure.
- `SUCCEED()` — Logs a successful assertion (documentary).
- `FAIL()` — Generates a fatal failure, aborting the current function.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` — Generates a nonfatal failure, continuing execution.

**Example:**
```cpp
if (unexpected_condition) {
  FAIL() << "Unexpected condition occurred";
}
```

### 2.8 GoogleTest Matchers with `EXPECT_THAT`
For powerful, readable, and extensible assertions, use matchers.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
EXPECT_THAT(text, StartsWith("Error:"));
```
Matchers produce detailed failure messages and can be combined or customized.

## 3. Using Assertions: Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these steps to integrate assertions into your test workflow effectively.

### Step 1: Select the Appropriate Assertion
Review your requirement:
- Validate a boolean condition → Use `EXPECT_TRUE` or `ASSERT_TRUE`.
- Compare two values → Use `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, etc.
- Compare strings → Use string-specific macros.
- Compare floating-point numbers → Use floating-point specific assertions.
- Expect exceptions → Use exception assertions.
- Check complex conditions → Use predicate assertions or `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers.

### Step 2: Write the Assertion Clearly
Use the macro in your test body, passing expressions or values you want to test.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Add) {
  int result = Add(2, 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 5) << "Add function failed to sum correctly.";
}
```

### Step 3: Run Your Tests
Compile and run your test executable as usual. GoogleTest will report assertion results.

### Step 4: Interpret Test Failures
When an assertion fails, GoogleTest produces detailed output:
- The expected and actual values.
- The expressions tested.
- File and line number.
- Optional custom failure message.

Use these details to diagnose and fix issues promptly.

### Step 5: Adjust Assertions as Needed
If failure messages are unclear or too generic, consider:
- Adding descriptive custom messages.
- Using predicate or matcher-based assertions for complex conditions.
- Utilizing floating-point assertions with appropriate tolerances.

## 4. Examples & Best Practices

### Example 1: Equality and Floating Point
```cpp
TEST(FloatingPointTest, ApproxEqual) {
  double expected = 3.14159;
  double actual = CalculatePiApprox();
  EXPECT_NEAR(actual, expected, 0.0001) << "Pi approximation is off.";
}
```

### Example 2: Exception Assertion
```cpp
TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_THROW(ParseInput(nullptr), std::invalid_argument);
  EXPECT_NO_THROW(ParseInput(valid_data));
}
```

### Example 3: Boolean and Predicate Assertions
```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }
...
EXPECT_TRUE(IsStarted());
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, result);
```

### Practice Tips
- Prefer `ASSERT_` macros if the failure should abort the current test function.
- Use custom failure messages (`<<`) to clarify intent and aid debugging.
- Avoid over-specifying tests; verify only what matters.
- For complex validation, use `EXPECT_THAT` with built-in or custom matchers.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

### Failure: Comparing C-Strings with `EXPECT_EQ`
Cause: `EXPECT_EQ` compares pointer addresses, not string contents.

Solution: Use `EXPECT_STREQ` to verify string equality.

### Floating-Point Equality Failures
Cause: Direct comparison fails due to precision errors.

Solution: Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR` with tolerance.

### Unexpected Exceptions
Cause: Exception assertions missing or incorrectly set.

Solution: Use `EXPECT_THROW` or `EXPECT_NO_THROW` to document expected exception behavior.

### Tests Continue Execution After Critical Failure
Cause: Using non-fatal `EXPECT_` where fatal `ASSERT_` should be used.

Solution: Use `ASSERT_` macros to halt execution on fatal errors.

### Uninformative Failure Messages
Cause: Missing custom messages or using simplistic assertions.

Solution: Add failure messages, or switch to matcher-based assertions for richer diagnostics.

<Callout title="Effective Assertion Usage Tips">
- Prefer `EXPECT_` when test can continue after failure, `ASSERT_` if test should abort immediately upon failure.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for complex conditions.
- Avoid comparing pointers to C-strings with `EXPECT_EQ`; use `EXPECT_STREQ` instead.
- Use floating-point assertions, NOT `EXPECT_EQ`, for decimal comparisons.
- Write clear and useful failure messages to speed up debugging.
