# Best Practices for Mock Usage

Explore expert recommendations for using GoogleMock (gMock) effectively in your C++ tests. This guide helps you avoid common pitfalls like overspecification and brittle tests, and offers advice on legacy codebases with real-world anti-patterns and solutions.

---

## 1. Introduction to Mock Usage Best Practices

GoogleMock empowers you to write precise, maintainable tests by mocking dependencies. However, using mocks effectively requires careful design of test expectations and behaviors.

This page focuses on how to:

- Set appropriate expectations without overconstraining tests.
- Manage mock strictness levels and uninteresting calls.
- Handle legacy code with mock adaptations.
- Recognize and avoid common anti-patterns.

By following these best practices, you enhance test reliability and maintainability.

## 2. Avoiding Overspecification

### Problem: Overly Strict Expectations

When you specify too many details—such as exact argument values for every call or rigid call ordering—your tests become brittle and tightly coupled to implementation details.

### Best Practice

- **Specify only what matters.** Use matchers like `_` to ignore irrelevant arguments.
- **Use fuzzy cardinalities.** For example, use `AtLeast(n)` or `AnyNumber()` instead of `Exactly(n)` when you don't care about exact counts.
- **Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()`** to let expectations retire when saturated, avoiding sticky failures from repeated calls.

### Example: Reasonable Loose Expectations
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GoTo(50, _)).Times(AtLeast(1));
```
This checks the first argument but allows any second argument and at least one call.

### Pitfall: Sticky Expectations
If you write several `EXPECT_CALL`s with the same matchers and no `.RetiresOnSaturation()`, only the last one is active, causing unexpected failures. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid this when expecting multiple sequential calls.

---

## 3. Handling Mock Strictness Modes

gMock offers three mock behavior modes that influence warnings and failures on uninteresting calls (calls to mocked methods without an `EXPECT_CALL`):

- `NiceMock`: suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock`: warns on uninteresting calls (the default).
- `StrictMock`: treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

### Choosing the Right Mode

- Use **`NiceMock`** for stable tests to avoid noise and maintain flexibility.
- Use **`NaggyMock`** when developing or debugging to catch unexpected calls.
- Use **`StrictMock`** only when you want to enforce strict call policies, understanding it increases test brittleness.

### Example: Creating a Nice Mock
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
```

### Important
`NiceMock` and `StrictMock` only affect *uninteresting* calls, not unexpected calls which always cause errors.

## 4. Using ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL Effectively

- *`ON_CALL`* defines **default behavior** when you do **not** expect a call.
- *`EXPECT_CALL`* both defines behavior and **sets an expectation** that the call must occur.

### Best Practice

- Use **`ON_CALL`** for stubbing default behavior that applies across many tests.
- Use **`EXPECT_CALL`** only when you want to verify a call happens, how often, and with what arguments.
- Avoid using `EXPECT_CALL` for every call unnecessarily to keep tests focused and maintainable.

### Catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`
Add an `EXPECT_CALL(mock, method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` to indicate all other call variants are acceptable without warnings.

---

## 5. Managing Call Order and Cardinality

### Ordering Calls

- Calls with no order constraints can happen in any sequence.
- Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to enforce strict or partial call ordering when validating call order is important.

Example:
```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2());
}
```

### Cardinalities

- Use cardinalities like `Times(AnyNumber())`, `AtLeast(n)`, or `Exactly(n)` to specify how often a call should occur.
- Omit `Times()` occasionally; gMock will infer appropriate cardinality from `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` clauses.

---

## 6. Avoiding Fragile Tests in Legacy Code

Legacy codebases may resist clean mocking due to tight coupling or lack of interfaces.

### Recommendations

- **Use adaptor interfaces**: Wrap legacy classes with clean interfaces you control to mock easily.
- **Delegate to real or fake implementations:** Use `ON_CALL().WillByDefault()` with lambdas calling real methods or fakes to minimize duplication.
- **Beware of over-mocking:** Focus on mocking only where interaction verification matters.

---

## 7. Examples of Common Anti-Patterns and Solutions

### Anti-Pattern 1: Overusing Exact Argument Matchers
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Process(42, "exact", 100));
```
fails if any unrelated argument changes.

**Solution:** Use matchers only for parameters that matter.
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Process(42, _, _));
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Multiple Overlapping Expectations Without Order
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Process(_));
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Process(42));
```
Last one shadows the first unintentionally.

**Solution:** Order expectations properly or combine actions.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Testing Behavior Rather than Contract
Tests break whenever internal calls change even if contract remains correct.

**Solution:** Mock at the interface boundary and only verify externally observable interactions.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Tips

### Uninteresting Call Warnings
- Check if you need to add an `EXPECT_CALL` or switch to `NiceMock`.

### Unexpected Call Failures
- Verify all expected calls are set **before** exercising the mock.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock activity and understand failures.

### Actions Running Out
- Confirm number of `.WillOnce()` clauses matches or is less than expected calls.
- Use `.WillRepeatedly()` to specify fallback behavior.

### Tests Failing on Deleted Mocks
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if mocks are intended to live beyond test scope.

## 9. Summary

Mastering mock usage requires balance: verify what matters, leave flexibility for implementation changes, and keep tests focused.

By leveraging mock strictness controls, carefully designed expectations, sequencing, and delegation patterns, you can write maintainable, robust tests.
