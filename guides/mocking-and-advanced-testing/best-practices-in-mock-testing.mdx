# Best Practices for Mock-Based Testing

GoogleTest's mock framework, GoogleMock, empowers you to create highly effective, maintainable, and stable tests through mock objects. This guide provides actionable strategies and patterns to ensure that your use of mocks enhances test clarity, encourages robust interface verification, and scales well as your project grows.

---

## 1. Understanding When to Use Mocks

Mocks are best applied when you want to verify interactions between components rather than their states. This typically includes:

- Validating that certain functions or methods are called with expected arguments.
- Testing code behavior under conditions that are difficult to reproduce with real objects (e.g., errors, timeouts).
- Replacing slow, unreliable, or unavailable dependencies (databases, file systems, network requests).

**Avoid using mocks as a primary way to test internal state or business logic.** Prefer using fakes or real implementations when possible, to keep tests more straightforward and less brittle.


## 2. Designing Mocks for Clarity and Maintainability

### 2.1. Define Clear Mock Interfaces

- Mock only interfaces or abstract classes. This separation promotes cleaner design and easier mocking.
- Avoid mocking concrete classes unless absolutely necessary.
- If your design exposes concrete classes, consider introducing an interface or adaptor layer for mocking.

### 2.2. Use the `MOCK_METHOD` Macro Effectively

- Place all `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public:` section of your mock class.
- Use the proper syntax, including `override` and `const` qualifiers, to reflect the original interface correctly.
- For overloaded methods, mock each overload explicitly to avoid ambiguity.

Example:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int x), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Reset, (), (const, override));
};
```

### 2.3. Start with Default Behavior Using `ON_CALL`

- Use `ON_CALL` to set sensible default behaviors without specifying the number of calls.
- Avoid overusing `EXPECT_CALL`—excessive expectations can make tests brittle.
- Set default behaviors in mock constructors or in test fixture setup methods.

Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_obj, GetValue(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

### 2.4. Use `EXPECT_CALL` Sparingly and Intentionally

- Apply `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to assert that a method is called.
- Clearly specify expected arguments using matchers.
- Prefer readability by setting a single concern per test.


## 3. Managing Call Expectations and Order

### 3.1. Exploit Cardinalities Judiciously

- Use built-in cardinalities such as:
  - `Times(Exactly(n))` for exact expectations.
  - `Times(AtLeast(n))` or `Times(AtMost(n))` for flexible counts.
  - `Times(AnyNumber())` when you don't care about the number of calls.

### 3.2. Use Sequences for Ordered Calls

- Wrap related expectations in an `InSequence` block when call order matters.
- For partial ordering, use `.InSequence(Sequence ...)` or `.After()` constraints.

Example:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Initialize());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Start());
}
```

### 3.3. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for Non-Sticky Expectations

- By default, expectations are "sticky" and remain active even after saturation.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to deactivate an expectation immediately when its call limit is reached.

### 3.4. Avoid Over-Specification

- Resist the temptation to specify every call and argument in tests.
- Use general matchers and cardinalities to keep tests flexible and resilient to implementation changes.


## 4. Handling Complex Mock Behavior

### 4.1. Customize Behavior with Actions

- Use `WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`, and combinations to define call results.
- Chain actions with `DoAll()` when returning values and modifying out parameters.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Modify(_))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<0>(5), Return(true)));
```

### 4.2. Delegate to a Fake or Real Object

- To reuse existing logic, delegate mock calls to a fake or a real implementation using lambdas.

Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Operation(_))
    .WillByDefault([&real](ArgType arg) { return real.Operation(arg); });
```

### 4.3. Use NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock Thoughtfully

- `NiceMock<T>` suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock<T>` warns on uninteresting calls (default behavior).
- `StrictMock<T>` treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Choose the appropriate mock wrapper based on how strict you want test warnings and failures.


## 5. Writing Robust Tests With Mocks

### 5.1. Set Expectations Before Calling Mocked Methods

- Always set expectations before exercising the system under test.
- Changing expectations after calls have been made leads to undefined behavior.

### 5.2. Clear and Verify Mocks Explicitly When Needed

- Mocks verify expectations on destruction automatically.
- If mocks persist beyond test scope, use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to verify early.

### 5.3. Handle Move-Only Types Correctly

- GoogleMock supports mocks of methods accepting or returning move-only types.
- Use lambdas or callables for explicit control over creation and return.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, MakeObject(_))
    .WillRepeatedly([](ParamType p) { return std::make_unique<MyObject>(p); });
```


## 6. Scaling and Refactoring Mock-Based Tests

### 6.1. Group Related Expectations Into Helper Methods

- To reduce duplication and improve readability, encapsulate common mock setups.

### 6.2. Refactor with Interfaces and Adaptors

- Decouple test code from concrete implementations to reduce test maintenance.

### 6.3. Use Partial and Strict Mocks Appropriately

- Partial mocks allow mixing real functionality and mocks.
- Use strict mocks sparingly; strictness protects but adds brittleness.

### 6.4. Use Matchers and Actions to Abstract Argument Details

- Matchers let you focus on relevant argument aspects, ignoring irrelevant ones.
- Compose complex matchers for clarity.

### 6.5. Suppress Noise from Uninteresting Calls During Development

- Switch between `NiceMock` and `NaggyMock` to control verbosity.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag to adjust logging levels.


## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 7.1. "Uninteresting function call" Warnings

- Occur when a mock method is called without an `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Suppress by adding `EXPECT_CALL(mock, method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` or switch to `NiceMock`.

### 7.2. Unexpected Call Failures

- Happen when a call does not match any active expectation.
- Check argument matchers, call order, and sequences.

### 7.3. Saturated Expectations Errors

- Occur when a method is called more times than the expectation.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or adjust `Times()`.

### 7.4. Overloading Ambiguity

- Specify argument types explicitly or mock all overloads.
- Use `Const()` wrapper for `const` overloaded methods.

### 7.5. Virtual Destructors

- Always ensure base interfaces have virtual destructors to avoid leaks and undefined behavior.

## Appendix: Quick Reference Examples

### Defining a Mock Class

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockWidget : public WidgetInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Initialize, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Update, (int newValue), (override));
};
```

### Setting Default Behavior and Expectations

```cpp
MockWidget mock;

// Default behavior
ON_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillByDefault(Return(10));

// Expect exactly two calls to Update with any argument
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update(_)).Times(2).WillRepeatedly(Return(true));

// Sequence example
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Initialize());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update(20));
}
```

### Using Matchers and Custom Actions

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update(Ge(0)));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update(_)).WillOnce([](int v) {
  // Custom action, side effects allowed
  DoSomething(v);
  return true;
});
```

### Working with Move-Only Types

```cpp
class MockCreator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(std::unique_ptr<Object>, CreateObject, (int id), (override));
};

EXPECT_CALL(mock_creator, CreateObject(_))
    .WillRepeatedly([](int id) {
      return std::make_unique<Object>(id);
    });
```
