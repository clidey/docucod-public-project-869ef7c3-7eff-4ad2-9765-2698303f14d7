# Writing Flexible Expectations and Matchers

Unlock the full power of GoogleMock's matcher system to write expressive and maintainable test expectations. This guide helps you understand how to verify arguments flexibly using matchers, combine multiple matchers for sophisticated validations, and troubleshoot common issues that arise when expectations don't behave as intended.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide focuses on using GoogleMock's matcher system to set up flexible expectations on mock method calls. You will learn to:
- Specify argument matchers for precise or generalized verification.
- Combine matchers to express complex argument constraints.
- Use multi-argument matchers with `.With()` clauses.
- Troubleshoot common matcher and expectation challenges.

### Prerequisites
- A working GoogleMock mock class with mocked methods.
- Basic familiarity with `EXPECT_CALL()` and `ON_CALL()` macros.
- Understanding of matchers and actions within GoogleMock.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Write clear and maintainable expectations that gracefully handle argument verification.
- Compose matchers to reflect real-world argument conditions.
- Use `.With()` to match function argument tuples for inter-argument relations.
- Diagnose and fix common issues related to mismatched or unsatisfied expectations.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20-30 minutes to read and practice with provided examples.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand Basic Argument Matchers
Every argument in an `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` can be matched using built-in matchers like `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `Ne()`, and many more.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(Eq(10), _));
```
This expects `Func` to be called with first argument 10 and any second argument.

### 2. Combine Matchers for More Expressive Constraints
Use combinators like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` to build powerful predicates:

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThis(AllOf(Ge(5), Ne(10)))); // Argument >=5 and !=10
```

This supports real scenarios, e.g., expecting an argument in a range but excluding certain values.

### 3. Use `.With()` to Match All Arguments as a Tuple
When your expectation depends on conditions spanning multiple arguments (e.g., argument 1 less than argument 2), `.With()` lets you verify the entire argument tuple.

```cpp
using ::testing::Lt;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // The first argument must be less than the second
```

The matcher inside `.With()` receives a `std::tuple` of all arguments. GoogleMock provides common multi-argument matchers like `Lt()` for 2-tuples.

### 4. Chain Matcher Clauses in `EXPECT_CALL`
Respect the order of clauses when writing expectations:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(matchers...))
    .With(multi_argument_matcher)  // Optional, max once
    .Times(cardinality)            // Optional, max once
    .InSequence(sequences...)      // Optional
    .After(expectations...)        // Optional
    .WillOnce(action)              // Optional, multiple
    .WillRepeatedly(action)        // Optional, max once
    .RetiresOnSaturation();        // Optional, max once
```

`.With()` must be the first clause and appear at most once.

### 5. Verify Default and Excessive Call Behavior
- Unmatched calls (unexpected calls) trigger failure and show detailed mismatch reasons.
- Calls exceeding the expected number cause over-saturation errors.
- `ON_CALL` specifies default behavior without enforcing call count.

### 6. Troubleshoot Common Matcher Issues
- When a call fails to match an expectation, GoogleMock reports which arguments did not match and why.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace all calls and matching attempts for debugging.
- Ensure `.With()` matcher and regular argument matchers are consistent and complementary.

## Examples & Patterns

### Matching Arguments Exactly
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(5, "data"));
```
Expects `Process` called with arguments 5 and "data".

### Using Wildcard Matcher `_`
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_, _));  // Matches any arguments
```
Useful to ignore argument values.

### Using Composite Matcher
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Send(AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(10))));
```
Expects `Send()` with an argument > 0 and < 10.

### Multi-Argument Matcher With `.With()`
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Move(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // First argument less than second
```
Demonstrates argument relation involving both parameters.

### Using `ExpectationSet` and `.After()` for Ordering
```cpp
using ::testing::Expectation;
Expectation init = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process()).After(init);
```
Ensures `Process()` is called only after `Init()`.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Unmatched Arguments:** Check the specific argument mismatch; use detailed verbose output.
- **Too Many or Too Few Calls:** Adjust `.Times()` cardinality or add `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.
- **Ambiguous Overloads:** Use `Const()` wrapper or explicit matcher type casts.
- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress or add appropriate `EXPECT_CALL` for the method.

### Best Practices
- Use `_` judiciously to avoid over-specifying tests.
- Compose matchers with `AllOf` or `AnyOf` for clarity.
- Prefer using `.With()` to express multi-argument conditions elegantly.
- Keep expectations simple and focused on relevant arguments.
- Use sequences to enforce call order explicitly.

### Performance Considerations
- Avoid overly complex matchers that slow test execution.
- Cache complex matcher compositions when reused.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use `MockFunction` for mocking callbacks or std::function parameters.
- Delegate to fake or real objects using `ON_CALL` with lambdas.
