# Effective Use of Assertions

Master the full range of assertions offered by GoogleTest. This guide showcases best practices, nuanced behaviors (fatal vs. non-fatal), and practical scenarios to improve your test reliability and expressiveness.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

Assertions are central to the behavior verification in your tests. GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertion macros designed to match different verification needs. These assertions are divided primarily into two classes based on their failure behavior:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: Aborts the current function immediately upon failure.
- **Non-fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: Records the failure but continues execution.

Understanding when and how to use each type is key to crafting effective tests.

### Why Make This Distinction?

Fatal assertions stop the test at the failure point to prevent cascading errors from invalid assumptions, while non-fatal assertions allow detecting multiple failures in a single test run.

---

## 2. Workflow to Use Assertions Effectively

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with C++
- Setup of GoogleTest in your development environment
- Inclusion of `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` in your test files

### Expected Outcome
- Mastery of GoogleTest assertion macros
- Ability to write expressive, maintainable test checks
- Improved test failure diagnostics and flow control in tests

### Time Estimate
- 15-30 minutes to understand and experiment with basic and advanced assertions

### Difficulty Level
- Intermediate; assumes basic GoogleTest familiarity

## 3. Step-by-Step Assertions Usage

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Between Fatal and Non-fatal Assertion">
Decide if the test should continue after a failure:
- Use `EXPECT_*` when test continuation makes sense to find multiple issues.
- Use `ASSERT_*` when subsequent operations depend on this assertion passing.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Basic Assertions for Common Checks">
Examples:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition);
ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual);
EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2);  // For C strings
```

After each, GoogleTest reports failures with detailed messages and locations.
</Step>
<Step title="Stream Custom Messages for Clarity">
Add descriptive failure messages for easier debugging:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(a, b) << "Mismatch in user ID values";
```

This message appears alongside failure details.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Predicate and Predicate-Format Assertions for Complex Conditions">
To get informative error output beyond simple Boolean checks:
- Use `EXPECT_PRED*()` with boolean functions to see argument values.
- Define predicates returning `testing::AssertionResult` to provide detailed messages.
- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*()` to customize failure message formatting fully.

Example:
```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(3));
```

Failure output includes why the predicate failed.
</Step>
<Step title="Handle Floating-Point Comparisons with Special Assertions">
Avoid equality pitfalls by using:
- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` for `float` values
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` for `double` values
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` when you need a tolerance

This prevents false failures due to rounding errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Assert on Exception Behavior (If Exceptions are Enabled)">
Test that code throws or does not throw with:
- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, ExceptionType)`
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)`
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)`

Useful for verifying error handling behavior.
</Step>
<Step title="Special Assertions Usage">
Explore specialized assertion macros:
- `SUCCEED()` and `FAIL()` for explicit pass/fail notifications
- `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests dynamically based on runtime conditions
- `StaticAssertTypeEq<T1, T2>()` to compile-time check type equality
- `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` to leverage rich gMock matchers

Example of dynamic skipping:
```cpp
TEST(MyTest, SkipIfNotReady) {
  if (!IsSystemReady()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "System not ready";
  }
  ...
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Place Assertions Correctly">
Remember:
- Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`) can only be used in void-returning functions.
- Avoid them in constructors/destructors; prefer `SetUp` and `TearDown` methods.
- For non-void functions, use non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`, `ADD_FAILURE()`).

If you need fatal checks in non-void functions, consider reworking function signature.
</Step>
<Step title="Propagate Fatal Failures from Subroutines">
Since fatal assertions abort only the current function, use:
- `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement)` or `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement)` to verify no fatal errors happened inside a subroutine
- `HasFatalFailure()` to check if a fatal failure occurred and conditionally return early

Example:
```cpp
void TestBody() {
  Helper();
  if (HasFatalFailure()) return;  // Prevent proceeding on failure
  ...
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Examples

### Basic Value Comparison

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(4), 24) << "Factorial calculation error at 4";
}
```

Expected output on failure:
```
Value of: Factorial(4)
  Actual: 23
Expected: 24
Factorial calculation error at 4
```

### Using Predicate Assertion

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not prime";
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i == 0) return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is divisible by " << i;
  }
  return testing::AssertionSuccess();
}

TEST(PrimeTest, CheckPrime) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(4));  // Will fail and print message
}
```

Failure message:
```
Value of: IsPrime(4)
  Actual: false (4 is divisible by 2)
Expected: true
```

### Using Floating Point Assertion

```cpp
TEST(FloatTest, ApproxEquals) {
  EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(0.3f, 0.1f + 0.2f);
}
```

This assertion tolerates minor floating point inaccuracies.

### Exception Assertion (with exceptions enabled)

```cpp
TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsOnInvalid) {
  EXPECT_THROW(DoSomethingInvalid(), std::invalid_argument);
}
```

## 5. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Pitfalls
- Using fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) inside non-void functions triggers confusing compiler errors.
- Forgetting that fatal assertions abort only the current function, causing potential crashes if code after the assertion assumes success.
- Misusing `EXPECT_TRUE` for complex predicates without providing failure details; prefer predicate assertions or `AssertionResult`-returning functions.
- Comparing floating point numbers for exact equality; prefer `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or tolerances with `EXPECT_NEAR`.

### Best Practices
- Use `EXPECT_*` as much as possible, and reserve `ASSERT_*` for precondition checks critical for test continuation.
- Use predicate assertions when `EXPECT_TRUE` is insufficiently informative.
- Stream helpful messages to assertions to aid debugging.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual trace info when assertions are buried in helper functions.
- Prefer `GTEST_SKIP()` for runtime skipping instead of manually aborting tests.

### Performance Considerations
- Write predicates efficiently to avoid expensive repeated evaluations in assertions.
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` to group subroutine assertions clearly without unintentional continuation.

### Advanced Techniques
- Define custom predicates that return `AssertionResult` for complex domain-specific checks.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT` coupled with matchers from GoogleMock for rich assertions.
- Use `StaticAssertTypeEq<T1, T2>()` in templates to catch type mismatches at compile time.
