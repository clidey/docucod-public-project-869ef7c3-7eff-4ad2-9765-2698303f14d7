# Using Assertions and Matchers Effectively

Master the diverse set of assertions and matchers GoogleTest offers. Gain practical insights on choosing the right matcher, writing expressive expectations, and creating custom checks that improve test clarity and precision.

---

## Overview

This guide focuses on empowering you to skillfully use assertions and matchers within GoogleTest to write more robust, clear, and maintainable tests. With practical examples and actionable advice, learn how to select the best matchers, compose expectations that precisely define test intent, and create custom matchers to capture complex validation scenarios.

---

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest usage and test writing.
- A working GoogleTest environment.
- Basic understanding of mock classes and methods (see the [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) guide).

---

## What You Will Achieve

- Confidently apply built-in assertions and matchers to cover a wide range of test validation needs.
- Express complex argument expectations succinctly and clearly using matchers.
- Write custom matchers for domain-specific validation.
- Use GoogleTest mocking assertions effectively to capture expected interactions.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Writing Basic Assertions

GoogleTest offers familiar assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_TRUE`, and specialized assertions such as `EXPECT_THAT` which combine well with matchers.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(foo.GetValue(), 42);   // Simple equality check.
EXPECT_TRUE(bar.IsReady());      // Verifies boolean condition.
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));  // Uses matcher for expressive check.
```

After basic assertions, move on to integration with matchers for more expressive power.

---

### 2. Using Built-in Matchers in Expectations

Matchers allow flexible and readable argument matching in mock method expectations.

- To match any value in an argument position, use the wildcard `_` matcher.
- Combine matchers to verify argument properties, e.g., `Gt(5)` for "greater than 5".
- Use composite matchers like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, or negate with `Not()`.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Not;

EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(_, Gt(10), Not("error")))
    .Times(2);
```

This sets an expectation that the second argument must be greater than 10 and the third argument must not be equal to the string "error".

---

### 3. Matching Multiple Arguments as a Whole

When individual argument matchers are insufficient, use the `.With()` clause in `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to specify a matcher against all arguments viewed as a tuple.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update(_, _))
    .With(Lt())  // Expects first argument less than second
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

Built-in tuple matchers like `Lt()` for 2-tuples simplify complex argument relationships.

---

### 4. Setting Call Cardinalities

Control how often a mock method is expected to be called using `.Times(cardinality)`.

Common cardinalities:

- `Exactly(n)` or `n`: Expect exactly `n` calls.
- `AtLeast(n)`: Expect at least `n` calls.
- `AtMost(n)`: Expect at most `n` calls.
- `AnyNumber()`: No limit on calls.
- `Between(m, n)`: Expect between `m` and `n` calls inclusive.

If omitted, GoogleTest infers cardinality based on the presence of `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` clauses.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoWork())
    .Times(3)
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

---

### 5. Specifying Actions with WillOnce and WillRepeatedly

Control what the mock function does when called:

- Use `.WillOnce(action)` to specify behavior for individual calls.
- Chain `.WillOnce()` to define different return values or actions in sequence.
- Use `.WillRepeatedly(action)` for behavior after `.WillOnce()`s are exhausted.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(3));
```

This expectation sets the first two calls to return 1 and 2 sequentially, and all following calls return 3.

---

### 6. Enforcing Call Order

By default, call order is not enforced.

- Use the `InSequence` helper to require strict call order.

Example:

```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Run());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Cleanup());
}
```

- Use `.After()` and `.InSequence()` clauses for partial ordering.

---

### 7. Handling Uninteresting Calls and Mock Object Behavior Modes

Uninteresting calls are calls to mock methods without an `EXPECT_CALL`.

- By default, gMock warns on uninteresting calls.
- To ignore warnings, wrap your mock with `NiceMock`.
- To promote warnings to failures, use `StrictMock`.

Example:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
```

---

### 8. Writing Custom Matchers

Create expressive, reusable matchers for domain-specific logic.

Example of a simple matcher:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "is divisible by 7") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}
```

Use in test:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(IsDivisibleBy7()));
```

For parameterized matchers, use `MATCHER_P`:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsWithinRange, range_end, "is within range") {
  return arg >= 0 && arg <= range_end;
}
```

---

### 9. Debugging and Diagnostics

- Use the command line flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed expectation matching and mock call tracing.
- Warnings like "Uninteresting mock function call" signal potentially missing `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- When expectations are not met, GoogleTest reports informative failure messages including which expectation was violated and why.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors without forcing expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to assert important interactions.
- Favor `NiceMock` during early development to reduce noise; switch to `StrictMock` as tests mature.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to deactivate expectations after fulfillment.
- Always set expectations before the mock is exercised.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to specify `.Times()` when you expect multiple calls.
- Over-specifying argument matchers leading to brittle tests.
- Misordering `EXPECT_CALL`s which can cause unexpected matches due to newest-first matching.
- Mocking non-virtual methods without using special techniques.
- Ignoring `Uninteresting call` warnings without verifying test correctness.

---

## Example: Testing a Simple Mocked Interface

```cpp
class MockCalculator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), (override));
};

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddsPositiveNumbers) {
  MockCalculator calc;

  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Add(_, _))
      .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));  // Always returns 42

  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(1, 2), 42);
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(10, 20), 42);
}

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddsExactValues) {
  MockCalculator calc;

  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Add(1, 2))
      .WillOnce(Return(3));
  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Add(10, 20))
      .WillOnce(Return(30));

  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(1, 2), 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(10, 20), 30);
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Uninteresting mock function call" Warning

- Occurs when a mock method is called without matching `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Solution: add an `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` if the call is valid but not critical.
- Or, use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for all uninteresting calls.

### Mismatched Expectations

- Check the argument matchers to ensure they correctly match the parameters your code sends.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace which expectation matched a call.

### Unexpected Call Failures

- Order of `EXPECT_CALL`s matters; more specific expectations should be declared after more general.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) or `.After` for controlling call order.

### Compilation Errors with Overloads

- Use `Const()` wrapper to specify const overloads.
- Use matcher casts as needed with `SafeMatcherCast`.
