# Organizing and Discovering Tests

Techniques for structuring test suites, naming conventions, test discovery, and parameterized tests. Learn to write scalable test code that’s easy to maintain and extend.

---

## 1. Introduction

GoogleTest facilitates writing comprehensive tests, but maintaining large test suites demands effective organization and discovery strategies. This guide focuses purely on techniques to structure tests, apply consistent naming conventions, leverage test discovery mechanisms, and use parameterized tests to build scalable and maintainable test code.

By mastering these techniques, you ensure your test codebase remains clean, navigable, and adaptable as your project grows.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with writing tests using GoogleTest.
- GoogleTest installed and integrated into your project (see [Installation and Setup](../getting-started/setup-prerequisites/installation-platforms)).
- A working knowledge of the `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros.

---

## 3. Organizing Tests

Organizing your tests effectively enables efficient coding, easier navigation, and better maintenance.

### 3.1 Structuring Test Suites

- **Group Related Tests Using TEST_F or TEST_P:**
  - Use `TEST_F` to associate tests with a test fixture class that sets up shared context.
  - Use `TEST_P` for parameterized tests that run the same logic across multiple input data sets.

- **Test Suites Correspond to Functional Modules:**
  - Align test suites with the components or classes they test to mirror your production code’s architecture.

- **Limit the Scope of Each TEST or TEST_F:**
  - Each test should focus on one distinct condition or behavior.

### 3.2 Naming Conventions

- **Test Suite Names:** Use descriptive fixture names reflecting the class or feature under test (e.g., `MockFooTest`).

- **Test Case Names:** Describe the behavioral aspect under test clearly and concisely using camel case or underscores.
  ```cpp
  TEST_F(MockFooTest, ReturnsTrueOnValidInput) { ... }
  TEST_F(MockFooTest, HandlesNullPointer) { ... }
  ```

- **Consistent Naming Helps Discovery and Filtering:**
  - Use appropriate prefixes or keywords for test names to enable selective test execution via filtering (e.g., `EXPECT_CALL`, `DeathTest`).

### 3.3 Test Directory Layout

- Organize your tests in directories reflecting your source tree structure.
- Separate unit test code from integration, end-to-end, or performance tests.

---

## 4. Discovering Tests

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests defined with `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()` macros by introspection.

### 4.1 How Test Discovery Works

- When your test executable runs, GoogleTest scans for all compiled tests.
- Tests are grouped by test suite and identified by test case names.

### 4.2 Running Specific Tests

- Use the `--gtest_filter` command-line flag to run specific suites or test cases.
  ```bash
  ./my_tests --gtest_filter=MockFooTest.*     # Runs all tests in MockFooTest suite
  ./my_tests --gtest_filter=*ValidInput        # Runs all tests with name containing 'ValidInput'
  ./my_tests --gtest_filter=-*Slow*            # Runs all tests except those with 'Slow' in name
  ```

- Combine filters for refined control.

### 4.3 Working with Parameterized Tests

- GoogleTest exposes each instantiation of a parameterized test as a separate test case.
- Use filters to run specific parameter cases.

---

## 5. Writing Scalable Tests with Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests let you write a test once and run it against multiple input values, improving coverage and reducing duplication.

### 5.1 Define Parameterized Test Fixture

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {
  // optional: SetUp(), TearDown()
};
```

### 5.2 Define TEST_P Test Case

```cpp
TEST_P(MyTestFixture, HandlesVariousInputs) {
  int param = GetParam();
  // Test logic using param.
}
```

### 5.3 Instantiate Test Cases

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    MyGroupName,      // Instantiation name.
    MyTestFixture,    // Test fixture class.
    ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 42),  // List of parameters.
    [](const testing::TestParamInfo<MyTestFixture::ParamType>& info) {
      return "Param" + std::to_string(info.param);  // Optional name generator
    });
```

### 5.4 Run Parameterized Tests

- The instantiated tests will appear in discovery.
- Run with filters as usual.

### 5.5 Best Practices

- Parameterize only truly invariant parts of your tests.
- Avoid overly complex test logic inside parameterized tests.
- Use descriptive names for instantiations for easy debugging.

---

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Use Descriptive and Consistent Naming:** Makes tests self-documenting and easy to filter.

- **Write Focused Tests:** Each test should verify one behavior.

- **Group Tests Logically:** Reflect your system or module architecture.

- **Leverage Parameterized Tests:** To avoid redundant code when testing multiple input variants.

- **Use Test Fixture Setup/TearDown Wisely:** Share test context appropriately to avoid duplication but keep tests independent.

- **Avoid Over-specifying in Filters:** Use broad filters as default, narrow down only when needed.

- **Regularly Refactor Tests:** As code evolves, keep your test suite clean and relevant.

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Tests Not Being Discovered

- Ensure proper use of `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` macros; typos prevent discovery.
- Verify test executable is built with all source files containing tests.
- Confirm no macro redefinitions masking test macros.

### 7.2 Filter Not Matching Tests

- Check the exact test suite and test names.
- Remember filter is case sensitive.
- Use wildcards `*` cautiously.

### 7.3 Complex Parameterized Tests Are Hard to Debug

- Keep parameter sets simple.
- Use verbose and descriptive instantiation names.

### 7.4 Tests Become Hard to Maintain Due to Unclear Organization

- Apply strict naming conventions.
- Structure tests parallel to source code.
- Use fixtures where needed.

## 8. Examples

### 8.1 Organizing Tests with Fixtures

```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize calc if needed
  }
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, SubtractsNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Subtract(5, 3), 2);
}
```

### 8.2 Parameterized Test Example

```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ((n % 2), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    EvenNumbers,
    IsEvenTest,
    ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8, 10));
```

### 8.3 Running a Subset of Tests

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_filter=CalculatorTest.AddsNumbers
```
