# Using Mocks Effectively

A step-by-step tutorial on defining, configuring, and leveraging mocks to isolate units under test. This guide covers expectation setting, call counting, argument matchers, and practical dos and don'ts for robust mocking.

---

## 1. Introduction to Effective Mocking

When writing unit tests, isolating the unit under test from its dependencies is crucial. Mocks let you simulate those dependencies, allowing you to verify interactions and control behavior precisely. This guide walks you through using GoogleMock to create powerful, maintainable mocks that fit your testing needs.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic familiarity with C++ and GoogleTest.
- Your project includes GoogleMock with `#include <gmock/gmock.h>`.

**Expected Outcome:**
By the end of this guide, you will be able to define mock classes, set robust expectations with flexible matchers, manage call counts properly, and avoid common pitfalls in mocking.

**Time Estimate:** About 30 to 60 minutes depending on experience.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate

## 2. Creating Mock Classes

Mocks are classes that simulate production code interfaces or classes, allowing full control over method behavior.

### Defining Your Mock Class

1. **Derive from the original class or interface:** The base must have virtual methods.
2. **Declare mock methods using `MOCK_METHOD`:** This macro automatically generates the mock implementation.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MyInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~MyInterface() = default;
  virtual int Compute(int x) = 0;
  virtual std::string GetName() const = 0;
};

class MockMyInterface : public MyInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int x), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, GetName, (), (const, override));
};
```

### Tips for Defining Mocks

- Place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the **public** section of the mock class, regardless of the original method’s access modifier.
- For methods with arguments or return types involving commas (like `std::pair<bool, int>`), either wrap such types in parentheses or use type aliases.

## 3. Setting Expectations

GoogleMock lets you specify *what* calls are expected on a mock and *how many times*.

### The `EXPECT_CALL` Syntax

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, MethodName(matchers...))
    .Times(cardinality)
    .WillOnce(action)
    .WillRepeatedly(action);
```

- `mock_object` - your mock instance.
- `MethodName` - name of the mocked method.
- `matchers` - argument matchers specifying expected argument values.
- `Times` - how many times the call should happen (optional).
- `WillOnce` / `WillRepeatedly` - specify the behavior on matching calls.

### Example: Basic Expectations

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

MockMyInterface mock;

// Expect Compute to be called exactly once with any argument and return 5.
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(_)).WillOnce(Return(5));

// Expect GetName to be called twice, returning "Test" each time.
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetName())
    .Times(2)
    .WillRepeatedly(Return("Test"));
```

### Cardinalities You Can Use

- `Times(n)` - exactly `n` calls
- `AnyNumber()` - any number of calls
- `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)`
- `Between(m, n)`
- `0` (as in `Times(0)`) indicates the method must *not* be called

### Important: Order of Expectations

- GoogleMock matches calls to expectations in *reverse order* of their declaration. More specific expectations often go last.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) to enforce call order when needed.

---

## 4. Default Behaviors vs Expectations

### Using `ON_CALL`

`ON_CALL` sets default behaviors for mock methods but does not set *expectations*.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Compute(_)).WillByDefault(Return(0));
```

This means if no `EXPECT_CALL` matches a call, this default action will be used instead.

### When to Use `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`

- Use `ON_CALL` to provide general default behavior for mock methods that are *not* the primary focus of the test.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to verify a call occurs with specific arguments and count.

**Best practice:** Favor `ON_CALL` for common setup and `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to verify precise interactions.

---

## 5. Argument Matchers

Matchers describe what argument values a mock method expects.

### Common Matchers

- `_` — matches anything (wildcard)
- `Eq(value)` — matches exactly `value`
- `Ge(value)`, `Gt(value)`, `Le(value)`, `Lt(value)` — relational matchers
- `NotNull()` — pointer not null

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(Ge(10)));  // Compute called with argument >= 10
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(_));        // Compute called with any argument
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(Eq(5)));   // Compute called with argument == 5
```

### Combining and Custom Matchers

You can combine matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`, or write custom matchers as needed.

---

## 6. Controlling Call Counts and Lifetime

### Sticky Expectations and `.RetiresOnSaturation()`

By default, expectations remain active even after saturation, causing failures if calls exceed the limit.

To prevent this, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire an expectation after it is fully satisfied.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(42))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

This lets later calls match other expectations without triggering errors.

### Sequences and Ordered Calls

Use `::testing::InSequence` to enforce the order of calls explicitly:

```cpp
{
  ::testing::InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

Calls must occur in this order or the test fails.

---

## 7. Using Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

GoogleMock supports tuning how uninteresting calls (calls without matching expectations) are handled.

| Mock Type  | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls                                   |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock` | Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls                      |
| `NaggyMock`| (Default) Prints warnings on uninteresting calls                |
| `StrictMock`| Treats uninteresting calls as errors (fails the test)           |

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockMyInterface> mock; // No warnings on uninteresting calls
```

**Warning:** Use strict mocks wisely, as they can introduce test brittleness.

## 8. Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ Specify **only the expectations you really care about**; over-specifying leads to brittle tests.
- ✅ Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors, `EXPECT_CALL` for verification.
- ✅ Prefer `NiceMock` for most situations to reduce noise from irrelevant calls.
- ✅ Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to prevent sticky expectations causing issues.
- ✅ Use argument matchers to keep expectations flexible and readable.
- ✅ Put expectations before exercising mocks.

### Don'ts

- ❌ Don't mix `EXPECT_CALL` and actual method calls unordered; set expectations before calls.
- ❌ Don't mock unnecessary methods; mock what the test requires.
- ❌ Don't ignore uninteresting calls without understanding their source.
- ❌ Don't suppress warnings by adding empty `EXPECT_CALL`s; use `NiceMock` instead.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Warning: "Uninteresting mock function call"

- This means a mock method without an `EXPECT_CALL` was invoked.
- Usually harmless if you don't need to verify that call.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings if they are expected.

### Failure: "Mock function called more times than expected"

- You exceeded the upper bound of expected calls.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after use, or loosen cardinality.

### Calls not Matching Expectations

- Check if argument matchers are too strict.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed trace of mock calls and matching decisions.
- Ensure expectations are set before exercising mocks.

### Slow Compilation of Mock Classes

- If mocks compile slowly, define mock class constructors/destructors outside header (in .cc file) to speed up building.

## 10. Practical Examples

### Example: Basic Mock Usage

```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& connection_string), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string& query), (override));
};

TEST(DatabaseTest, ConnectsAndQueries) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;

  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect(_))
      .WillByDefault(Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query("SELECT * FROM users"))
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(Return(42));

  // Code exercising mock_db...
  ASSERT_TRUE(mock_db.Connect("db://url"));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_db.Query("SELECT * FROM users"), 42);
}
```

### Example: Using Matchers and Sequences

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::InSequence;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Return;

MockMyInterface mock;

{
  InSequence seq;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Gt(5))).WillOnce(Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_)).WillOnce(Return(false));
}

EXPECT_TRUE(mock.Process(10));  // Matches first call
EXPECT_FALSE(mock.Process(1));  // Must come after 10 due to InSequence
```

### Example: Ignoring Uninteresting Calls with NiceMock

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockMyInterface> mock;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(5));

// Calls to other methods or arguments won't produce warnings.
mock.Process(5);
mock.OtherMethod();  // No warning
```
