# Running Tests and Interpreting Results

## Overview

This guide helps you understand how to run your GoogleTest executables, interpret the output, and utilize GoogleTest's test discovery and filtering capabilities for efficient testing. Whether you want to run all tests, specific test suites, or individual test cases, this guide will enable you to get fast, meaningful feedback.

### Prerequisites

- A compiled test executable built with GoogleTest, either linked to `gtest_main` or with a custom `main()` that calls `testing::InitGoogleTest()`.
- Familiarity with writing tests using the `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros.
- Basic understanding of command-line usage.

### Expected Outcome

You will be able to:

- Run all tests in your program.
- Filter tests by name to run a subset of tests.
- Run specific test cases or suites.
- Understand and interpret GoogleTest's output to quickly identify pass/fail results.

### Time Estimate

About 10-20 minutes to learn and apply basic and filtered test runs.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

If your test executable is linked with `gtest_main` or provides a `main()` that calls `testing::InitGoogleTest()`, simply execute the test binary:

```bash
./your_test_executable
```

This runs all registered tests and outputs a summary.

### Run All Tests with Verbose Output

To get more detailed information during the test run, use the `--gtest_print_time=1` flag to print the elapsed time for each test:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_print_time=1
```

This helps identify slow tests for optimization.

### Filtering Tests

GoogleTest supports running a subset of tests based on their full names (TestSuiteName.TestName) using the `--gtest_filter` flag.

#### Syntax of `--gtest_filter`

- It accepts colon-separated glob patterns (wildcards `*` and `?`) for positive filters.
- Optionally, a negative pattern can be specified after a `-` character.

Format:

```
--gtest_filter=PositivePattern[-NegativePattern]
```

#### Examples:

- Run only tests whose name contains "Factorial":
  ```bash
  ./your_test_executable --gtest_filter="*Factorial*"
  ```

- Run all tests in the `QueueTest` suite:
  ```bash
  ./your_test_executable --gtest_filter="QueueTest.*"
  ```

- Run tests starting with `Handles` except the one named `HandlesZeroInput`:
  ```bash
  ./your_test_executable --gtest_filter="*Handles*:-*HandlesZeroInput"
  ```

#### Notes:

- Wildcards `*` match zero or more characters.
- The filter matches against the full test name in `TestSuiteName.TestName` format.

### List All Registered Tests

You can see all test suites and tests registered in your executable without running them using:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_list_tests
```

This helps you decide what filters you want to use.

## Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest produces a clear output designed to help you quickly assess test results.

### Typical Output Format

```
Running main() from gtest_main.cc
[==========] Running 5 tests from 2 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput (1 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[----------] 2 tests from QueueTest
[ RUN      ] QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially
[       OK ] QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] QueueTest.DequeueWorks
[       OK ] QueueTest.DequeueWorks (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from QueueTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 5 tests from 2 test suites ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 4 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesNegativeInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

### Key Elements

- `[ RUN      ]` Marks when a test starts.
- `[       OK ]` Marks a test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ]` Marks a test failed.
- Summary lines show totals for tests run, passed, and failed.

### Test Failure Details

When a test fails, GoogleTest prints the failure message, the source file, and the line number where the failure occurred, including the failing assertion message.

Example failure:

```
/path/to/factorial_unittest.cc:23: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(1)
    Which is: 0
  1
```

This detailed information lets you quickly pinpoint the problem.

## Advanced Test Running Features

### Running Disabled Tests

Some tests may be disabled with names starting with `DISABLED_` or flagged disabled. By default, these are skipped.

To run disabled tests, use the flag:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

You can combine this with filters to include disabled tests matching your criteria.

### Repeating Tests

To run the entire test suite multiple times, use:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_repeat=N
```

Where `N` is the number of times to repeat (use `-1` to repeat indefinitely).

### Randomizing Test Order

Use the `--gtest_shuffle` flag to run tests in random order, helping identify order dependencies:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_shuffle
```

You can specify a seed with `--gtest_random_seed=<number>` to reproduce the random order.

### Running Specific Tests Programmatically

Inside your code, you can register and run tests selectively using GoogleTest's API, but most users can leverage command-line filters for quick selection.

## Practical Tips

<Tip>
To speed up your test-feedback cycles, first run only a small subset of tests using filters based on changed code areas.

Combine test selection with repeated runs (`--gtest_repeat`) and shuffling (`--gtest_shuffle`) to detect flaky tests.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_list_tests` early to explore the available test suites and test names before crafting filter expressions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Remember that test filtering uses glob patterns, not regular expressions. Avoid using regex syntax, and only use `*` and `?` as wildcards.
</Warning>

---

## Summary

1. **Run all tests with:**
   ```bash
   ./your_test_executable
   ```
2. **List all tests (without running):**
   ```bash
   ./your_test_executable --gtest_list_tests
   ```
3. **Run a subset of tests by name filter:**
   ```bash
   ./your_test_executable --gtest_filter="TestSuiteName.TestName"
   ```
4. **Run disabled tests:**
   ```bash
   ./your_test_executable --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
   ```

Always interpret output by identifying lines starting with `[  FAILED  ]` and reading the detailed failure messages.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="No tests found or executed">
If running your test executable produces no tests or zero run tests:

- Verify tests are properly defined with `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros.
- Check that the test executable is linked with the proper GoogleTest libraries, such as `gtest_main` or includes a `main()` calling `InitGoogleTest()`.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to verify that tests are registered.
- Review any build or linkage warnings that might indicate missing symbols.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Filtering yields no tests">
- Make sure your `--gtest_filter` value matches the full test names (`TestSuiteName.TestName`).
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm exact test and suite names.
- Remember filters are glob, not regex.
- Avoid typos and consider quoting filters in shell to avoid shell expansion.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test output is too verbose or too brief">
Adjust output verbosity:

- Use `--gtest_print_time=1` to see elapsed times.
- Use `--gtest_brief=1` to report failures only.
- Check if custom listeners are overriding outputs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests hang or timeout">
- Run individual tests using filters to isolate hangs.
- Check your test code for infinite loops or external dependencies.
- Use test environment setup/teardown hooks to isolate environment issues.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Running Selected Tests

Suppose you have the following tests:

- `FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput`
- `FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput`
- `QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially`
- `QueueTest.DequeueWorks`

To run only the `QueueTest` suite:

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_filter=QueueTest.*
```

To run only the `HandlesZeroInput` test:

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
```

To run all except `QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially`:

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_filter=-QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially
```

---

## Basic Example: Custom Main Function

If not linking with `gtest_main`, your `main()` should look like:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

The `InitGoogleTest` call parses flags and sets up GoogleTest, and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` runs all tests and returns `0` on success.
