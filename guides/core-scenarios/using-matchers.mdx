# Effective Use of Matchers

This guide explores how to use **matchers** effectively in GoogleTest and GoogleMock, enabling you to write expressive, concise, and robust tests that verify complex objects, method arguments, and call interactions. Whether you're asserting values in tests or specifying expectations on mock methods, mastering matchers will reduce boilerplate and enhance your test clarity and maintainability.

---

## 1. Understanding Matchers

Matchers are predicates that test values or arguments against criteria to verify correctness. Instead of checking raw values, matchers describe *what* you expect, making tests both readable and informative.

### Why Use Matchers?

- Avoid brittle tests by specifying flexible conditions.
- Provide clear failure messages showing expected vs actual values.
- Compose complex conditions from simpler ones.
- Match arguments in mocks to precisely verify interactions.


### Basic Matcher Syntax

You can use matchers inside assertions or mock expectations with syntax like:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(actual_value, matcher);
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matcher1, matcher2));
```

For example:

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, Forward(Ge(100)));
```

Here, `StartsWith` and `Ge` (greater or equal) are built-in matchers.


### Wildcard Matcher `_`

The special matcher `_` matches any value and is useful for ignoring arguments or values you don't care about explicitly:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_, 5));  // First arg anything, second arg equals 5
```


## 2. Using Matchers in GoogleTest Assertions

Matchers shine in assertions via the `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` macro, which provides detailed failure reports if the condition fails.

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;

int result = Calculate();
EXPECT_THAT(result, AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(100)));  // result > 0 and < 100
```

**Combining Matchers:**

- `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)` — all matchers must hold.
- `AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)` — any matcher may hold.
- `Not(m)` — the negation of matcher.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AnyOf(Eq(1), Eq(2), Eq(3)));  // value is 1, 2, or 3
EXPECT_THAT(value, Not(Eq(0)));                   // value is not 0
```


### Matching Container Contents

Matcher utilities exist for containers, e.g., `ElementsAre` tests each element.

```cpp
using ::testing::ElementsAre;
std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3};
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(ElementsAre(1, 2, 3)));
```

For unordered containers, use `UnorderedElementsAre`.


## 3. Using Matchers in GoogleMock Expectations

Matchers specify which arguments calls to mock methods are expected to receive.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, GoTo(50, _));  // Expect GoTo called with x=50, y=anything
```

### Specifying Multiple Matchers

You can provide one matcher per argument:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(Ge(0), Lt(10), Eq("test")));
```

If you don’t specify matchers and the method is not overloaded, it is treated as all `_` by default.


### Matching Multiple Arguments as a Whole

If you want to validate multiple arguments in combination, use `.With()`:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // Expect first argument < second argument
```

This passes all arguments as a tuple to the matcher.


### Matching Complex Arguments

To test only a member or property of an object argument:

```cpp
using ::testing::Field;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Draw(Field(&Point::x, Eq(10)), _));
```

`Field(&Class::member, matcher)` matches if the member satisfies the matcher.

Similarly, for getters:

```cpp
using ::testing::Property;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Property(&Bar::GetValue, Gt(100))));
```


### Matching Pointers by Their Pointed-to Values

To verify the value pointed to by a pointer argument:

```cpp
using ::testing::Pointee;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(Pointee(Eq(42))));
```

This also works with smart pointers.


## 4. Creating Custom Matchers

For use cases where built-in matchers aren’t enough, you can write your own. The easiest way is to use `MATCHER` macros.

### Example: Matcher Checking Divisibility by 7

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}

EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy7());
```


### Parameterized Custom Matcher

```cpp
MATCHER_P(InRange, range, "") {
  return arg >= range.first && arg <= range.second;
}
EXPECT_THAT(value, InRange(std::make_pair(10, 20)));
```


### Custom Matcher with Descriptions

Enhance failure messages by adding explanations inside the matcher body:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleByN, n, "") {
  if (arg % n != 0) {
    *result_listener << "which has remainder " << (arg % n);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```


## 5. Advanced Matcher Techniques

### Combining Matchers

Build composite matchers to express complex logic:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(x, AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(100), Not(Eq(50))));
```

### Safe Matcher Casting

Use `SafeMatcherCast` when the matcher type doesn't exactly match the argument type but is compatible:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThis(SafeMatcherCast<Derived*>(m)));
```

### Matching Overloaded Methods

Use `Const()` or explicit matcher casts to disambiguate overload resolutions:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(Const(mock), GetBar()).WillOnce(ReturnRef(bar));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetBar(Matcher<int>(Eq(5))));
```

### Using Matchers as Predicates

You can use matchers like predicates in STL algorithms via `Matches()`:

```cpp
int count = std::count_if(v.begin(), v.end(), Matches(Gt(10)));
```


## 6. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use `_` sparingly to avoid over-permissive tests.
- Compose matchers for clarity rather than writing complex lambdas inside expectations.
- When matching containers, prefer `ElementsAre` or `UnorderedElementsAre` for precise feedback.
- Avoid over-specifying; specify only the arguments you care about.
- For commonly reused matchers, assign them to named variables.


## 7. Troubleshooting Matcher Usage

<Tip>
If your matcher always fails unexpectedly:

- Verify argument types match expected types.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock matching logs.
- Check for overlap in multiple expectations causing conflicts.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Overusing overly strict matchers may make tests brittle against harmless refactoring.
</Warning>

## Appendix: Matcher Example Code

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::_;           // matches anything
using ::testing::Ge;          // >=
using ::testing::StartsWith;  // string starts with
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Not;

class MockPrinter {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Print, (int n), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Print, (char c), ());
};

TEST(MatcherExample, BasicMatchers) {
  MockPrinter printer;

  EXPECT_CALL(printer, Print(Ge(100)));  // Expect printing >=100
  printer.Print(150);

  EXPECT_CALL(printer, Print(_));        // Expect printing anything
  printer.Print(42);

  // Using string matcher
  EXPECT_THAT("Hello World", StartsWith("Hell"));

  // Combining matchers
  EXPECT_THAT(50, AllOf(Ge(30), Not(Eq(42))));
}
```
