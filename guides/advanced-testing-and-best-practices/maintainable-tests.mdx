# Writing Scalable and Maintainable Tests

## Overview

This guide helps C++ developers organize test code effectively to ensure tests remain reliable, understandable, and easy to extend as projects grow. You will learn best practices for naming, structuring, and writing tests that minimize duplication, clarify intent, and promote long-term maintainability.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with GoogleTest and GoogleMock basics.
- Basic understanding of writing tests with `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`.

### Expected Outcome

- Ability to write tests that can scale with your codebase.
- Techniques to reduce test flakiness and maintenance overhead.
- Clear understanding of how to organize test suites and fixtures.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 20-30 minutes to digest and apply these guidelines.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate

## 1. Design Your Test Suites Thoughtfully

**Goal:** Organize tests such that related tests are grouped logically, mirroring your code’s structure or behavior.

- Use descriptive and consistent names for test suites and tests:
  - The test suite name (first argument in `TEST()`/`TEST_F()`) should represent the module, class, or feature under test.
  - The test name (second argument) should indicate the behavior under test.

**Example:**
```cpp
// Grouping factorial tests under FactorialTest suite.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

**Best Practice:** Avoid underscores in test names to keep them valid C++ identifiers and improve readability.


### Tips

- Maintain a one-to-one mapping of test suites to classes or components where feasible.
- For large classes, split tests into multiple smaller suites based on related functionalities.

---

## 2. Use Test Fixtures to Avoid Duplication

**Goal:** Share common setup and teardown code through test fixtures (`TEST_F`), enabling tests to focus on the specifics they intend to validate.

- Define a test fixture class by deriving from `testing::Test`.
- Initialize shared objects and state in the fixture’s constructor or `SetUp()` method.
- Clean resources in `TearDown()`, if necessary.

**Example:**
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Best Practices

- Keep test fixtures focused and lean; limit the number of shared resources to those truly relevant.
- Avoid complex fixture inheritance hierarchies to minimize confusion.
- Use `TEST_F()` only when you need shared state.

---

## 3. Adopt Clear and Consistent Naming Conventions

**Goal:** Names should convey precisely what is tested, enabling owners and contributors to understand test purpose instantly.

- Prefix test suites with the component or class under test.
- Test names should specify conditions or behaviors.
- Use camel case or Pascal case for names, avoid underscores in test names.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FileParserTest, ReturnsErrorOnMissingFile);
TEST(StringUtilsTest, TrimsWhitespaceCorrectly);
```

### Common Pitfalls

- Avoid vague test names like `Test1` or `CheckBehavior`.
- Avoid mixing styles between test names and test suite names.

---

## 4. Minimize Duplication with Helper Functions and Parameterized Tests

**Goal:** Avoid repeated code across tests to keep maintenance easy and intentions clear.

- Extract common assertions or code sequences into helper functions in the test fixture.
- Use parameterized tests (`TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) to run the same test logic over multiple inputs without duplication.

**Example:**
```cpp
class PrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(PrimeTest, IsPrime) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ValidPrimes, PrimeTest, ::testing::Values(2,3,5,7,11));
```

### Tips

- Whenever repetition appears with only small input variations, prefer parameterized tests.
- Use helper methods within fixtures to consolidate repeated expectation formatting or complex verifications.

---

## 5. Control Mock Behavior to Prevent Flakiness

Unreliable tests cause loss of confidence. Use GoogleMock features effectively to maintain reliability.

- Prefer `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on irrelevant calls.
- Use `StrictMock` when you want to catch unexpected calls as errors.
- Define default actions with `ON_CALL()` to specify common behaviors and prevent unexpected results.

**Example:**
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
ON_CALL(mock_foo, GetSize()).WillByDefault(Return(5));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Process(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### Best Practices

- Avoid too strict verification unless needed; it improves test maintainability.
- Avoid leaving unhandled method calls that can cause false negatives.
- Regularly review mock expectations as code evolves to prevent accumulation of irrelevant constraints.

---

## 6. Organize Test Files and Naming Structure

Keep the source tree clean and tests discoverable.

- Name test files consistently, typically with `_test.cc` suffix.
- Place tests alongside code or under dedicated `tests/` directories, following project conventions.
- Avoid excessively large test files; split logically related groups.

### Tips

- Adopt and document your project’s test file naming standard.
- Use namespace or directory structure to reflect test grouping.

---

## 7. Write Tests for One Behavior Per Test

Keep tests focused. Each test should verify one behavior or scenario.

- If a feature has multiple aspects, write multiple tests.
- Use meaningful test names that describe exactly what is verified.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(LoginManagerTest, RejectsInvalidPassword);
TEST(LoginManagerTest, AllowsValidPassword);
```

### Benefits

- Easier failure diagnosis.
- Less brittle tests.
- Better documentation of expected behaviors.

---

## 8. Clean Up After Tests

Avoid side effects that affect other tests:

- Use fresh test fixtures for isolation (default in GoogleTest).
- Avoid static or global variables in tests; if required, reset their state.
- Use `TearDown()` in fixtures when necessary.

---

## 9. Use Assertions Wisely

- Prefer non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) to allow multiple checks per test.
- Use fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) when continuing doesn’t make sense (e.g., null pointers before dereference).

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Flaky Test Causes and Fixes

| Problem                             | Solution                                   |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Tests depend on external state     | Mock dependencies; use isolated test fixtures |
| Unmocked, uninteresting calls      | Use `NiceMock` or explicitly expect calls  |
| Overly strict expectations         | Relax strictness or use partial matchers    |

### Best Practices

- Use `ON_CALL` to define behaviors that apply to most calls.
- Add specific `EXPECT_CALL` to check critical interactions only.
- Leverage `RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations that should retire when fulfilled.
