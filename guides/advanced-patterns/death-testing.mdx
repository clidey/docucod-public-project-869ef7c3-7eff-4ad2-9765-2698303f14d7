# Death Testing for Robustness

Learn to use death tests within GoogleTest to verify error-handling and failure scenarios. Practical walkthroughs show how to set up and interpret death test outcomes for resilient C++ applications.

---

## 1. Introduction to Death Tests

### What Are Death Tests?
Death tests verify that your program terminates (i.e., "dies") under specific erroneous conditions. These tests are essential for confirming that your assertions, fatal error checks, or critical failure scenarios behave as expected by aborting the program to avoid unsafe execution.

### Why Use Death Tests?
Assertions and error-handling code are often designed to fail-fast, terminating the process when something critical goes wrong. Death tests ensure these safety nets are triggered correctly, protecting your program’s robustness.

> Remember, death tests differ from exception testing—they check actual process termination rather than exception throwing.

### Key Characteristics
- The code under test runs in a separate subprocess.
- The test checks **that** the process dies and **why/how** (exit code, signal, or error output).
- GoogleTest supports flexible patterns for matching error messages.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before writing death tests, ensure:
- You have a working GoogleTest environment with death test support enabled (`GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`).
- Your test executable is run with a path containing at least one path separator (e.g. `./my_test`). This is needed by thread-safe death tests.
- The environment is single-threaded or compatible with the death test style you choose.

> For multithreaded processes, use the "threadsafe" death test style to avoid issues.

## 3. Basic Death Test Macros

GoogleTest provides the following primary macros to write death tests:

| Macro                  | Behavior Description                                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_DEATH(stmt, regex)` | Verifies that `stmt` causes process termination and that output to `stderr` matches `regex`.  |
| `ASSERT_DEATH(stmt, regex)` | Same as `EXPECT_DEATH`, but aborts the current test on failure.                                |
| `EXPECT_EXIT(stmt, predicate, regex)` | Confirms `stmt` causes exit with status satisfying `predicate` and matching `regex`.      |
| `ASSERT_EXIT(stmt, predicate, regex)` | Same as `EXPECT_EXIT` but aborts on failure.                                                |
| `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH` / `ASSERT_DEBUG_DEATH` | Like `EXPECT_DEATH` / `ASSERT_DEATH` but only trigger in debug builds (`NDEBUG` aware).    |
| `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` / `ASSERT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` | Run death tests only if supported on the platform.

## 4. Writing a Basic Death Test

Follow these steps to create a death test that verifies your code fails safely and outputs an expected error message:

<Steps>
<Step title="Write the Death-Inducing Statement">
Use a statement or expression that you expect will terminate the process.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(abort(), "Aborted");
```
</Step>
<Step title="Define the Expected Error Pattern">
The second argument is a regex pattern (or GoogleTest matcher) that should appear in the program’s `stderr` output during termination.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(Foo(42), "Invalid input");
```
</Step>
<Step title="Choose the Correct Macro">
Decide whether to use `EXPECT_DEATH` to continue after failure or `ASSERT_DEATH` to abort the test immediately on failure.
</Step>
<Step title="Compile and Run Tests">
Build your test target and run it. GoogleTest spawns a child process to execute the death test.

If the child process terminates and outputs the expected error, the test passes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Advanced Death Test Features

### Compound Statements
You can test blocks of code together:
```cpp
ASSERT_DEATH({
  int x = 1;
  Foo(x);
}, "Expected error message");
```

### Checking Exit Codes or Signals
Use `EXPECT_EXIT` / `ASSERT_EXIT` with predicates:
```cpp
EXPECT_EXIT(NormalExit(), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "Success");
EXPECT_EXIT(KillProcess(), testing::KilledBySignal(SIGKILL), "Killed");
```

### Debug Mode Death Tests
Use `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH` to check code that crashes only in debug builds:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH(DieInDebugMode(), "debug error");
```

### Setting Death Test Style
Choose between "fast" and "threadsafe" styles for running death tests:
- **fast**: child process runs test immediately after fork.
- **threadsafe**: child process re-executes binary filtering to run only the death test.

Set style globally:
```cpp
GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
```

## 6. Practical Examples

### Example: Testing an Abort
```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, AbortTest) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(abort(), "Aborted");
}
```

### Example: Testing for a Specific Error Message
```cpp
void Foo(int x) {
  if (x < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Negative input error\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  // normal code
}

TEST(FooDeathTest, NegativeInput) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(Foo(-1), "Negative input error");
}
```

### Example: Testing Exit Code and Message
```cpp
TEST(ExitTest, SuccessExit) {
  EXPECT_EXIT(exit(0), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "");
}

TEST(ExitTest, FailureExit) {
  EXPECT_EXIT(exit(5), testing::ExitedWithCode(5), "");
}
```

## 7. Best Practices and Tips

- **Unique Test Suites for Death Tests:** Name test suites containing death tests with the suffix `DeathTest` to ensure proper ordering and isolation.

- **Avoid Multiple Death Assertions per Line:** Place only one death test assertion on a single line to avoid obscure compilation errors.

- **Handle Mocks Carefully:** If you are using mocks in death tests, consider allowing leaks with `Mock::AllowLeak()` to prevent mock detector errors on exit.

- **Avoid Side Effects in Death Statements:** Since death tests run in subprocesses, memory or state changes in death statements will *not* reflect in the parent process.

- **Use Appropriate Regex:** GoogleTest supports a subset of regex for death tests. Avoid unsupported constructs like grouping `( )`, union `|`, and ranges `{}`.

- **Set Death Test Style Appropriately:** For multithreaded code or those using complex runtime environments, prefer the "threadsafe" style.

- **Beware of Threads:** Death tests emit a warning if multiple threads are detected as forking in a multithreaded process can cause deadlocks or hangs.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Death Test Doesn’t Fail as Expected
- Ensure the statement actually causes termination.
- Check if your regex matches the actual `stderr` output.
- Use more permissive regex to debug (e.g., `".*"`).

### WARN: Multiple Threads Running
Death tests are generally unsafe to run in multi-threaded contexts; consider setting the death test style to "threadsafe":
```cpp
GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
```

### Death Test Runs but Process Lives
The tested statement likely returned instead of terminating. Avoid `return` statements inside death tests.

### Test Fails with "Unknown death test style"
Check the value of `--gtest_death_test_style` is `fast` or `threadsafe` only.

## 9. How It Works Internally

*GoogleTest* runs death tests by spawning a child process, running the death-inducing statement, capturing its output and exit status, and verifying termination as expected. There are different ways to spawn (fork/clone on POSIX, CreateProcess on Windows).

This separation enables safe testing of process termination without aborting the entire test runner.

## 11. Summary

Death testing is vital to verify program robustness by ensuring your code dies when it must—guarding against unsound states. GoogleTest simplifies this with clear macros, flexible predicates, and regex matching on error output while managing platform idiosyncrasies in process control. By following best practices and carefully crafting death tests, you embed safety checks directly into your testing suite.

# Quick Reference Code Snippet
```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, AbortsOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(
    {
      // Compound statement triggering death
      if (!ValidInput(-1)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Invalid input detected");
        abort();
      }
    },
    "Invalid input"
  );
}
```

<Tip>
To avoid flaky death tests, ensure the test environment is stable, the death test style suits your threading context, and your regex matches the exact error output generated during process death.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Misusing death tests—such as writing non-terminating death statements, running tests in multithreaded environments without "threadsafe" style, or expecting side effects from death test code—leads to unpredictable behavior or test failures.
</Warning>
