# Optimizing Test Performance

## Overview

As test suites grow in size and complexity, maintaining fast feedback cycles becomes critical for developer productivity and continuous integration efficiency. This guide details practical techniques and recommendations for reducing test run time and resource usage in GoogleTest and GoogleMock environments. You'll learn strategies for focused test execution, test selection and filtering, and how to leverage parallelism effectively.

---

## 1. Focused Test Execution

When working actively on a subset of your codebase, it's often unnecessary and inefficient to run the entire test suite. GoogleTest provides mechanisms to run targeted tests:

### Using Test Filters

You can limit the tests executed using the `--gtest_filter` flag with a wildcard pattern matching test suite and test names:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_filter=FastPath*  # Runs tests whose names start with "FastPath"
./my_tests --gtest_filter=NetworkTest.*-NetworkTest.SlowTest  # Runs all NetworkTest except SlowTest
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use specific filters during development to iterate quickly without running irrelevant or slow tests.
- Combine positive and negative filters to exclude flaky or expensive tests temporarily.

### Disable Tests Temporarily

Prefix test names or test suites with `DISABLED_` to skip them during runs:

```cpp
TEST(DISABLED_MyTestSuite, HeavyTest) { ... }  // This test won't run
```

This is useful for excluding known slow or flaky tests while investigating faster feedback.

### Implementing Focused Test Runs in CI

Configure your CI pipeline to execute critical smoke tests on every commit, and run the full test suite less frequently or on scheduled builds.

---

## 2. Test Selection and Filtering

To optimize resource usage further, consider filtering tests based on runtime characteristics or tags:

### Tagging Tests

GoogleTest doesn't provide native test tagging but you can adopt naming conventions or use custom test environments to organize and select tests.

Example naming:

```cpp
TEST(SmokeTest, BasicFunctionality) { ... }
TEST(IntegrationTest, DatabaseConnectivity) { ... }
```

Then filter by:

```shell
--gtest_filter=SmokeTest.*
```

### Using Parameterized and Typed Tests Wisely

While parameterized and typed tests are powerful for coverage, avoid combinatorial explosion by selecting only meaningful parameter sets during routine runs.

---

## 3. Leveraging Parallel Test Runners

Parallel test execution is the most impactful way to reduce wall clock test time.

### GoogleTest Sharding

GoogleTest natively supports *test sharding*, where the test suite is split across multiple processes or machines.

**Setup:**

- Set `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` to the total number of shards.
- Set `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to the shard index (0-based).

Example running tests across 4 shards:

```shell
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 ./my_tests
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1 ./my_tests
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2 ./my_tests
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=3 ./my_tests
```

Each shard runs a subset of tests, collectively covering the entire suite.

**Benefits:**

- Utilizes multiple CPU cores or machines.
- Ideal for large distributed build systems or CI runners.

### Multi-Threaded Tests

GoogleTest is thread-safe and test runners can execute tests over multiple threads, provided tests themselves are thread-safe or isolated.

### Parallel Test Runners in Build Systems

Many build systems provide native parallel test execution (e.g., `bazel test --jobs=N`). Integrate GoogleTest with these systems to automatically run tests concurrently.

---

## 4. Test Filtering and Focus Techniques

### Using `--gtest_repeat` to Identify Flaky Tests

Repeatedly running a subset of tests can expose non-deterministic failures. Pair this with filtering to optimize test cycles.

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_filter=NetworkTest.* --gtest_repeat=100
```

### Using `--gtest_break_on_failure` During Development

Pauses test execution on first failure to debug interactively.

### Combining Flags for Efficient Test Runs

Maximize effectiveness with combined flags for filtering and sharding:

```shell
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 ./my_tests --gtest_filter=FastTest.*
```

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Avoid Over-Specification:** Excessive use of exact matchers and call order constraints may slow tests and increase brittleness.
- **Use `RetiresOnSaturation()`** with expectations that only need to match a limited number of calls, to free resources and avoid conflicts.
- **Design Tests for Parallelism:** Minimize shared global state or use proper synchronization to avoid flaky tests when running concurrently.
- **Mock Only What You Need:** Heavy mock configurations can slow tests. Aim for precise, minimal mocks.
- **Profile Tests:** Regularly measure test run time to identify bottlenecks.
- **Prioritize Tests:** Run fast and critical tests more often; schedule slower integration or system tests less frequently.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

| Symptom                         | Cause                                                | Solution                                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Slow test runs                  | Entire test suite runs when not needed                | Use filtering, sharding, and parallel runners|
| High resource consumption       | Many tests run sequentially on limited hardware       | Run tests in parallel or distribute across machines|
| Flaky tests under parallelism   | Shared state, race conditions in tests                 | Use proper isolation or synchronization       |
| Excessive output or logging      | Verbose test logging enabled                           | Lower verbosity or selectively disable logging|
