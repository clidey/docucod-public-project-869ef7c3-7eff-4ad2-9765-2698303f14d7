# Performance and Test Suite Optimization

## Overview

This guide provides actionable strategies to optimize your GoogleTest test suites for reduced runtime, improved scalability, and better resource utilization. It focuses on managing large test suites by leveraging key GoogleTest features such as test filtering, sharding, and parallel test execution, ensuring your testing workflow scales efficiently as your codebase grows.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What You Will Achieve

- Identify ways to minimize test execution time.
- Learn to manage large test suites via filtering and sharding.
- Enable parallel execution of tests to leverage multi-core processors.

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with running GoogleTest tests.
- Project setup with multiple test cases or suites.
- Access to your test executables and ability to specify command-line flags or environment variables.

### Time Commitment

- Initial setup and optimization steps: ~30 minutes.
- Continuous usage for scalable testing workflows.

### Difficulty Level

- Intermediate: Requires understanding GoogleTest command-line options and environment setup.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Reduce Test Runtime with Test Filtering

GoogleTest supports running only a subset of tests, enabling fast iterations when you need to focus on specific areas.

- **How to Filter Tests:** Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to specify which tests to run.

- **Filter Syntax:** 
  - Positive patterns separated by `:` to include tests.
  - Optional negative patterns prefixed by `-` to exclude tests.

- **Example Usage:**

  ```bash
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.*-MySuite.Skip*
  ```

- **Expected Outcome:** Only tests matching `MySuite.*` name pattern but not starting with `Skip` will execute, reducing runtime.

- **Verification:** Confirm command line output shows only filtered tests running.

### 2. Manage Large Test Suites with Sharding

When your test suite scales, distribute test execution across machines or containers.

- **Enable Sharding via Environment Variables:**
  - `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: total number of shards (machines).
  - `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: current machine shard index (0-based).

- **Example:** On Machine 0:

  ```bash
  export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
  export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
  ./my_test_binary
  ```

- **Effect:** GoogleTest will partition the tests so each shard runs a unique subset, allowing parallelization across machines.

- **Verification:** Each shard should run disjoint test sets, and combined shards cover all tests once.

### 3. Parallel Test Execution

Running tests in parallel across multiple cores improves throughput.

- GoogleTest does not have built-in parallel execution of tests, but integration with build/runners (e.g., Bazel, CTest, or CI systems) exploiting test sharding or multiprocessing is recommended.

- **Tips:**
  - Combine sharding environment variables with your build tool’s parallel execution.
  - Run multiple instances of your test binary in parallel with different `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` values.

- **Example Using Bazel:** Use Bazel’s native support for test sharding and parallel execution by specifying `--test_sharding_strategy=explicit`.

### 4. Use Disabled Tests for Temporary Exclusion

Sometimes large suites contain flaky or slow tests. Temporarily disable them:

- Renaming tests or test suites with the prefix `DISABLED_` prevents their execution.

- **Example:**

  ```c++
  TEST(DISABLED_MyTestSuite, FlakyTest) {
    // Test code
  }
  ```

- **Enable Disabled Tests:** Use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag.

### 5. Monitor and Optimize Slow Tests

- Generate detailed reports with `--gtest_output=xml:report.xml` or JSON output.

- Analyze test durations to identify slow tests.

- Consider rewriting or splitting slow tests, reusing shared resources, or parallelizing as possible.

## Examples & Command Line Snippets

### Example: Running a Filtered Subset

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=NetworkTests.*
```

Runs only all tests within `NetworkTests` suite.

### Example: Running Shards

On 3 machines, run:

```bash
# Machine 0
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./my_tests

# Machine 1
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./my_tests

# Machine 2
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2
./my_tests
```

### Example: Including Disabled Tests

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Filter doesn’t match any tests:** Ensure test suite and test names do not contain underscores, as these are discouraged and may cause filter mismatches.

- **Sharding with overlapping test executions:** Each shard must have a unique `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`. Confirm environment variables are set correctly on each shard.

- **Parallel runs causing flaky tests:** Check for shared global state or resource contention in tests. Refactor tests to be independent.

### Best Practices

- Always use granular test filters to iterate quickly during development.

- Use test sharding primarily for CI environments with multiple machines.

- Combine test filtering with sharding for flexible targeted CI runs.

- Investigate and fix flaky tests instead of permanently disabling them.

- Use `--gtest_output=xml:filename.xml` to generate reports that you can analyze for slow or failed tests.

### Performance Considerations

- Reuse resources with `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to avoid expensive repeated setup.

- Avoid writing large parameterized tests with too many instances causing blow-ups.

- Disable or refactor inherently slow integration tests for nightly or less frequent runs.
