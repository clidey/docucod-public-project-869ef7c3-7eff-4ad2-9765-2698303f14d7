# Understanding Test Discovery

## Workflow Overview

**What This Guide Covers**

This guide explains how GoogleTest automatically discovers, registers, and runs tests in your C++ codebase. It breaks down the naming conventions, test registration processes, and strategies for efficiently organizing test suites, enabling you to scale your tests as your project grows.

**Prerequisites**
- Familiarity with writing basic tests using GoogleTest macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc.).
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed and integrated in your development environment.
- Working knowledge of C++ testing concepts.

**Outcome**
By following this guide, you will understand how GoogleTest’s test discovery works behind the scenes, enabling you to write tests that are automatically found and executed with minimal setup. You will also learn how to structure your test suites for maintainability and scalability.

**Time Estimate:** 15–20 minutes

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

## How GoogleTest Discovers Tests

GoogleTest uses a combination of macros, naming conventions, and static registration techniques to find and run your tests without explicit registration calls from the user. This process allows for quick iteration and easy integration.

### 1. Using Macros to Define Tests

You declare tests using macros such as `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P`. Each invocation of these macros:

- Defines a test case class internally.
- Creates a static object that registers the test with GoogleTest at program startup.

For example:

```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, MyTestCase) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```

The above defines a test called "MyTestCase" within the suite "MyTestSuite".

### 2. Naming Conventions

- **Test Suite Name (e.g., `MyTestSuite`)**: Groups related tests.
- **Test Case Name (e.g., `MyTestCase`)**: The specific test within the suite.

Naming is flexible but:
- Should avoid special characters and spaces.
- Should be unique within the test binary to prevent collisions.

Naming with clear, descriptive names improves the clarity and maintainability of the test suite.

### 3. Static Test Registration

GoogleTest leverages static object initialization within translation units:

- Each test macro declares a static object that registers itself with GoogleTest’s internal test registry.
- This registration occurs before `main()` runs, so GoogleTest knows about all tests when you start running tests.

This automatic registration means there is no need to manually list or invoke each test.

### 4. How Tests Are Located at Runtime

The GoogleTest framework initializes its registry during startup by collecting all registered tests.

When you run your test binary:

- It queries the registry to retrieve test suite and test case names.
- It allows tests to be filtered, listed, or run in any order.

Filtering can be done by passing command-line options such as:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTestCase
```

This flexibility lets you run all tests, subsets, or individual tests easily.

## Organizing Test Suites for Scalable Projects

As your test coverage grows, maintaining and scaling your test suites becomes critical.

### Best Practices for Test Suite Organization

- **Group Related Tests by Functionality:**
  Organize tests into suites based on components, features, or modules.

- **Keep Test Files Manageable:**
  Split large test files into multiple smaller files by feature or suite.

- **Use Test Fixtures (`TEST_F`) for Shared Setup:**
  When multiple tests require common setup and teardown logic, use test fixtures to reduce duplication and improve clarity.

- **Leverage Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`) for Repetitive Patterns:**
  Use parameterized tests to run the same test logic with different input data.

- **Consistent Naming:**
  Establish naming conventions for test suites and cases to reflect intent and improve discoverability.

### Controlling Test Suite Registration

To avoid inadvertently registering unwanted tests:

- Place tests in dedicated source files compiled only when needed.
- Use compilation flags or conditional compilation for platform-specific or optional tests.

### Example Directory Organization

```text
/tests
  /math
     add_test.cc
     subtract_test.cc
  /io
     file_io_test.cc
     network_io_test.cc
  /utils
     string_utils_test.cc
     time_utils_test.cc
```

Each file contains related test suites to keep the project organized and compilations manageable.

## Verifying Tests Are Discovered and Run

After integrating GoogleTest and writing tests, it is essential to confirm that the framework discovers and executes them correctly.

### Step 1: Run Your Test Binary

```bash
./your_test_binary
```

GoogleTest will run all discovered tests and print results.

### Step 2: List All Tests

Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to print all discovered test suites and cases without running them.

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

Output example:

```text
MyTestSuite.
  MyTestCase
AnotherSuite.
  TestOne
  TestTwo
```

### Step 3: Filtering Tests

Use `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests or suites:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*   # Runs all tests in MyTestSuite
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=*.MyTestCase     # Runs any test named MyTestCase
```

## Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Always Use the GoogleTest Macros**: Avoid manually registering or invoking tests.
- **Unique Names**: Duplicate test suite or case names can cause unexpected behavior.
- **Static Initialization Order**: Ensure tests are defined in translation units included in your build to guarantee registration.
- **Avoid Overusing Anonymous Namespaces for Tests**: They might affect linkage and test discovery.

<Tip>
If your tests do not appear in the output of `--gtest_list_tests`, verify they are compiled and linked into your test binary.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use descriptive and consistent naming for test suites and cases to easily filter and manage tests.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Expectations (e.g., using `EXPECT_CALL`) must be set before exercising mocks. Setting expectations after the test execution phase can lead to undefined behavior.
</Warning>

## Example: Writing and Discovering Tests

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test suite with two test cases.
TEST(MathTest, AddsCorrectly) {
    EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

TEST(MathTest, SubtractsCorrectly) {
    EXPECT_EQ(5 - 3, 2);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Run the binary:

```bash
./math_test
```

To see the two tests registered, use:

```bash
./math_test --gtest_list_tests
```

Expected output:

```text
MathTest.
  AddsCorrectly
  SubtractsCorrectly
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Test Discovery Issues">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running">
If your tests are not running:
- Ensure the files containing tests are compiled and linked.
- Confirm you call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main`.
- Verify tests use the GoogleTest macros properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Duplicate Test Names">
Duplicate test suite or test case names will cause conflicts. Rename suites/cases to unique names.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Filtering Not Working">
Check that the filter pattern syntax matches your test and that test names match exactly.
