# Test Discovery & Execution

Discover how GoogleTest automatically finds and runs tests in your codebase. This guide explains how to run individual tests, apply filters, control test execution, and interpret test results efficiently to speed up development.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Achieve
This guide empowers you to:

- Automatically discover all tests in your compiled test binary.
- Run all tests or a subset of tests based on flexible name filters.
- Execute individual or groups of tests to optimize feedback cycles.
- Understand your test results, including failures, skips, and successes.

### Prerequisites

- You must have a GoogleTest-based test binary built and ready to run.
- The `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` has been called in your `main()`.
- Basic familiarity with test suite and test naming conventions in GoogleTest.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Run all tests automatically without a hard-coded list.
- Narrow test runs to relevant tests using filters.
- Analyze the test output to identify failures and success.
- Control test execution order and repetition via command-line flags.

### Time Estimate

Getting started with basic test discovery and execution takes less than 10 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Running All Tests

GoogleTest automatically registers all tests defined using macros like `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and others.

To run all tests, simply invoke the test binary without any special flags or run:

```sh
./my_test_binary
```

or programmatically in your `main()` function via:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

**Result:**

All discovered tests will execute in some order. Upon completion, a summary of passed, failed, and skipped tests will be displayed.

---

### Step 2: Running Individual or Selected Tests Using Filters

GoogleTest offers powerful filtering with the `--gtest_filter` flag to run specific tests or test suites.

#### How the Filter Works

- The filter pattern syntax is `pos_patterns[-neg_patterns]` where:
   - `pos_patterns` is a colon-separated list of positive glob patterns.
   - `neg_patterns` is a colon-separated list of negative glob patterns to exclude.

- Test full names are `TestSuiteName.TestName`.

- Wildcards `*` and `?` can be used in patterns.

#### Examples:

- Run a single test:

  ```sh
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest
  ```

- Run multiple tests matching a pattern:

  ```sh
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*
  ```

- Run all tests except those in a certain test suite:

  ```sh
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=-ExcludedSuite.*
  ```

- Run tests containing "Fast" anywhere in their test names:

  ```sh
  ./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=*Fast*
  ```

**Result:**

Only tests matching the positive patterns and not matching the negative patterns run.

---

### Step 3: Listing All Registered Tests

To list all tests discovered in your test binary without running them, use:

```sh
./my_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

**Output:**

```
MyTestSuite1.
  TestA
  TestB
MyTestSuite2/TypeParam/0.
  TypedTest1
...
```

This helps identify test suite and test names for use with filters.

---

### Step 4: Running Disabled Tests

Tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` in their names are excluded from normal runs.

- To run disabled tests, add `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`:

```sh
./my_test_binary --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

- You can combine with filtering, e.g., to run a specific disabled test:

```sh
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.DISABLED_TestName --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests
```

---

### Step 5: Controlling Test Execution Order

- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order.
- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to run the entire test suite N times (use -1 for infinite).

Example:

```sh
./my_test_binary --gtest_shuffle --gtest_repeat=5
```

---

### Step 6: Skipping Tests at Runtime

Within a test or fixture setup, you can skip tests programmatically using:

```cpp
GTEST_SKIP() << "Reason for skipping this test.";
```

Skipped tests do not count as failures.

---

## 3. Understanding Test Results Output

### Basic Output Structure

After tests run, output typically includes:

- Test suite and test names
- PASS/FAIL/SKIP indicators
- Detailed failure messages for failed assertions
- Summary statistics

### Identifying Failures

Failures list file and line numbers with custom failure messages, helping you locate bugs quickly.

### Skipped Tests

Tests skipped via `GTEST_SKIP()` or tests disabled by naming convention are reported as skipped.

---

## 4. Advanced Test Execution Tips & Best Practices

### Combining Filters

Filters can include multiple positive patterns separated by `:`, to run multiple test suites or tests.

Example:

```sh
--gtest_filter=Suite1.*:Suite2.TestCase
```

### Using Environment Variables

On some platforms, you can configure test filters with environment variables like `GTEST_FILTER` if command line is inconvenient.

### Continuous Integration

Frequently run important tests using filters or test sharding to split workload.

### Timeout and Fail-Fast

Use flags like `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop on the first failure for faster feedback.

### Debugging Failing Tests

Run single tests with:

```sh
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyFailingTest
```

Then attach a debugger if needed.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Problem: Tests Not Discovered or Run

- Ensure `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Verify naming conventions (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc.) are used properly.
- Check for typos in filter patterns.

### Problem: Disabled Tests Not Running

Add the flag `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` explicitly.

### Problem: Filter Matches No Test

Run `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm names and adjust filter accordingly.

### Problem: Tests Run in Unexpected Order

GoogleTest runs tests in registration order unless `--gtest_shuffle` is used.

### Tips

- Use `--gtest_brief` for concise output when running many tests.
- Use `--gtest_print_time` to get per-test execution times.

<Info>
Check out `--gtest_list_tests` to discover all test names and `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests.
</Info>

<Check>
Always pass command-line arguments through `testing::InitGoogleTest` before running tests.
