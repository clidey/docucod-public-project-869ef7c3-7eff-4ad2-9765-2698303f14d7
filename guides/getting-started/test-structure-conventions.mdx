# Structuring and Organizing Tests

Organizing your test code efficiently is crucial as your test suite grows. This page provides practical strategies, naming conventions, and directory layouts that help you keep tests manageable, discoverable, and maintainable over time.

---

## 1. Overview of Test Organization

### Why Structure Tests?
As your codebase evolves, the number and complexity of tests increase. Without a clear organization, tests become difficult to navigate, understand, and maintain. Proper structuring supports:
- **Easy navigation:** Quickly find or add tests related to specific features.
- **Clear intent:** Naming and layout express the purpose and scope of tests.
- **Scalability:** Facilitate test suite expansion without chaos.
- **Integration:** Help CI and build systems discover and run tests efficiently.

### Prerequisites
- A C++ project using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Basic familiarity with writing tests and mocks.

### Expected Outcome
You will learn how to:
- Adopt effective directory and file layouts for tests.
- Apply naming conventions that improve clarity.
- Organize test code logically reflecting your project structure.

### Time Estimate
Setting up and refactoring your test organization can take 30 minutes to a few hours depending on project size.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Best Practices for Test Structure

### 2.1 Directory Layout
Use a directory structure that mirrors the source tree wherever practical, placing test files alongside or in parallel with the corresponding source files.

#### Example Layout
```
project_root/
  src/
    module_a/
      foo.cc
      foo.h
    module_b/
      bar.cc
      bar.h
  test/
    module_a/
      foo_test.cc
    module_b/
      bar_test.cc
```

**Advantages:**
- Tests are logically grouped by feature or component.
- Easy to locate related tests and code.
- Simplifies dependency and build management.

### Alternative
For very large projects, consider grouping tests by type or test level:
```
  test/
    unit/
    integration/
    system/
```

### 2.2 File Naming
Adopt a consistent suffix pattern for test files.

- Use `_test.cc` or `_unittest.cc` for test source files.
- For mocks, consider `_mock.h` or `_mock.cc` if separate.

**Example:**
- `foo_test.cc` — unit tests for `foo.cc`
- `bar_mock.h` — mock class definitions for `bar` dependencies

### 2.3 Test Suite and Test Case Naming
- Name your test suites after the class or module under test.
- Use descriptive, concise test case names that reflect the scenario or behavior being verified.
- Avoid overly generic names like `Test1` or `BasicTest`.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FooTest, HandlesEmptyInput) {
  ...
}

TEST(FooTest, ReturnsErrorWhenInvalid) {
  ...
}
```

### 2.4 Grouping Related Tests
- Use `TEST_F` fixtures to group tests that need common setup.
- For parameterized tests, use `TEST_P` with clear naming reflecting varied inputs.

---

## 3. Organizing Mock Classes

- Define mock classes in dedicated headers, often under a `testing` or `mocks` subdirectory.
- Place mocks close to the code they mock; avoid polluting production headers.
- Use clear, descriptive class names prefixed with `Mock`.

**Example:**
```cpp
// test/module_a/foo_mock.h
class MockFooDependency : public FooDependency {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (int x), (override));
   ...
};
```

- Group mocks by feature or logical dependency.
- For large test suites, consider layering mocks according to their abstraction.

## 4. Workflows for Test Development and Maintenance

### Writing New Tests
1. Identify the feature, class, or function to be tested.
2. Locate or create the corresponding test directory and test file with proper naming.
3. Write test cases using `TEST` or `TEST_F`.
4. If mocks are required, locate or create mock classes.
5. Adhere to naming conventions for readability.
6. Add tests incrementally and verify locally.

### Refactoring Existing Tests
- Use consistent naming for new test cases and suites.
- Reorganize tests into appropriate files/directories,
  keeping related tests together.
- Extract common setup into fixtures.
- Decompose long test files into multiple smaller ones if necessary.

## 5. Naming Conventions

| Item                | Naming Convention                 | Example                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Test file suffix    | `_test.cc` or `_unittest.cc`     | `foo_test.cc`             |
| Mock class prefix   | `Mock` + class name              | `MockFooDependency`       |
| Test suite name     | `<ClassOrModuleName>Test`         | `FooTest`                 |
| Test case name      | Describes behavior or scenario   | `HandlesInvalidInput`     |
| Sequence names      | Clear descriptive names           | `InitializationSequence` |

---

## 6. Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Avoid excessive nesting.** Deep directory structures can make navigation difficult.
- **Be explicit in naming.** Clear test names make results easier to interpret.
- **Use fixtures wisely.** Don't overuse fixtures for unrelated tests.
- **Define mocks close to their scope.** Prevents unnecessary dependencies.
- **Keep tests small and focused.** Each test should verify one behavior.
- **Update tests on refactoring.** Avoid test rot by reorganizing tests as code changes.

## 7. Example: Adding and Organizing a New Test

Suppose you add a new feature in module `network` with class `Connection`. Here's how you proceed:

1. Create `test/network/connection_test.cc`.
2. Use `ConnectionTest` as the test suite.
3. Write individual test cases:
```cpp
TEST(ConnectionTest, ConnectsSuccessfully) {
  Connection conn;
  EXPECT_TRUE(conn.Connect());
}

TEST(ConnectionTest, FailsOnInvalidAddress) {
  Connection conn;
  EXPECT_FALSE(conn.Connect("bad_address"));
}
```
4. If the new feature depends on `Socket`, create `test/network/socket_mock.h`:
```cpp
class MockSocket : public Socket {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(bool, Open, (), (override));
   MOCK_METHOD(void, Close, (), (override));
};
```
5. Structure your mocks and tests under the `network` folder, keeping related code together.

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issue: Tests are hard to find or maintain
- Review and simplify directory layout.
- Ensure naming conventions are consistently applied.
- Use IDE or tools capable of indexing tests.

### Common Issue: Mocks scattered or duplicated
- Consolidate mocks in a `mocks` or `testing` directory.
- Use interfaces and adaptors to isolate third-party dependencies.

### Tip: Use sequences and `InSequence` for ordered calls
- Helps organize expectations when order matters.

### Tip: Suppress uninteresting call warnings for nuisance mocks
- Use `::testing::NiceMock<YourMock>`.

### Tip: Avoid overly strict expectations to reduce brittle tests
- Use fuzzy cardinalities like `AtLeast()` or `AnyNumber()` judiciously.
