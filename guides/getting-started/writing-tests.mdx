# Writing Basic and Parameterized Tests

## Overview

This guide walks you through writing your first unit tests using GoogleTest. You will learn how to create individual tests, set up fixture-based tests for sharing common setup and teardown logic, and write parameterized and type-parameterized tests to verify your logic under varying conditions. Practical examples are provided to help you master testing with GoogleTest efficiently.

### Prerequisites

- A working GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation in your development environment.
- Basic familiarity with C++ and unit testing concepts.
- A C++ project configured to use GoogleTest (see the [Quickstart Workflow](https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart.html) and [Configuring Your Test Project](/getting-started/configuration/configuring-test-project) for setup).

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Write simple unit tests to verify isolated pieces of code.
- Use test fixtures to manage repetitive test setup and cleanup.
- Create parameterized tests to run the same test logic against multiple inputs.
- Build type-parameterized tests to verify templates or generic code.

### Time Estimate

Allocate approximately 30-45 minutes to complete the examples and internalize key concepts.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## 1. Writing Individual Tests

GoogleTest lets you write individual test cases with the `TEST` macro, capturing a logical test scenario.

### Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Define a test** using `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`.
2. **Write assertions** inside the test body to verify expected outcomes.
3. **Compile and run** your test executable to see results.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple function to test
int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Individual test
TEST(AdditionTests, AddsTwoPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

**Expected Result:** The test passes indicating `Add` correctly sums 2 and 3.

### Tips
- Use `EXPECT_` macros for non-fatal assertions, allowing the test to continue on failure.
- Use `ASSERT_` macros to abort the test on failure.

---

## 2. Creating Fixture-Based Tests

Test fixtures let you set up and tear down common objects and resources for multiple tests.

### Workflow

1. Define a test fixture class derived from `::testing::Test`.
2. Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` if needed.
3. Write tests using `TEST_F` macro with the fixture class.

### Example

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup code
    value = 42;
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Common cleanup
  }
  int value;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, ValueIsCorrect) {
  EXPECT_EQ(value, 42);
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, ValuePlusOne) {
  EXPECT_EQ(value + 1, 43);
}
```


### Benefits
- Reduces duplicate test initialization code.
- Provides clearer organization of related tests.

## 3. Writing Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests allow you to write a test logic once and run it multiple times with different input data.

### How to Write Parameterized Tests

1. Derive a test fixture from `::testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is your parameter type.
2. Use the `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` macro to specify the test values.
3. Access inputs with `GetParam()`.
4. Write your test(s) with `TEST_P` macro.

### Example: Testing a function with multiple inputs

```cpp
int IsEven(int n) {
  return (n % 2) == 0;
}

class EvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(EvenTest, CheckIfEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(IsEven(n), (n % 2 == 0));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  EvenNumbers,
  EvenTest,
  ::testing::Values(0, 2, 4, 6, 8));

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  OddNumbers,
  EvenTest,
  ::testing::Values(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));
```

**Expected Outcome:** Each parameterized test runs once for each value.

### Tips and Pitfalls
- Use `Values()`, `Range()`, or combinations with `Combine()` to define parameters.
- Avoid complex setup in the test body; keep tests focused.

## 4. Writing Type-Parameterized Tests

Use type-parameterized tests to verify your template code with multiple types.

### Steps

1. Define a fixture class template derived from `::testing::Test`.
2. Define the test with `TYPED_TEST_P` and register it.
3. Instantiate the test suite with the list of types.

### Example

```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  T value = 5;
};

TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(NumericTest);

TYPED_TEST_P(NumericTest, IsPositive) {
  EXPECT_GT(this->value, 0);
}

REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(NumericTest, IsPositive);

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, float>;
INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyGroup, NumericTest, MyTypes);
```


### Notes
- Use `this->` to access members of the fixture in `TYPED_TEST_P`.
- Useful for testing templates and generic code.

---

## Summary

You now have a solid foundation for writing basic tests in GoogleTest:

- Individual tests with `TEST`.
- Test fixtures sharing setup with `TEST_F`.
- Parameterized tests for input variations with `TEST_P`.
- Type-parameterized tests to cover templates with `TYPED_TEST_P`.

For deeper knowledge, explore formatting assertions, custom matchers, and integrating your tests into CI workflows.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Tests not discovered or running:** Ensure test executables are linked with GoogleTest and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called.
- **Unexpected test failures:** Use `--gtest_verbose=info` for detailed test logs.
- **Compilation errors on mocked methods:** Check method signatures and use `MOCK_METHOD` properly.
- **Ambiguous parameterized test errors:** Confirm parameters and test registrations are correct and types match.

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive test names reflecting the behavior under test.
- Start with simple tests, then use parameterized variants as needed.
- Use test fixtures to promote reuse and clarity.
- Keep individual tests focused on one aspect.

### Tips

- Run tests frequently during development to catch regressions early.
- Combine GoogleMock facilities with tests for more expressive verification.
- See the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) and [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html) for advanced mocking scenarios.
