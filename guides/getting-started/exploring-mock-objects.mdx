# Exploring Mock Objects

## Introduction

This guide introduces you to the essentials of **GoogleMock (gMock)**, the powerful C++ mocking framework integrated with GoogleTest. You'll learn how to create mock classes, define expectations, and verify interactions, enabling you to write precise and maintainable unit tests.

Through a realistic example, this guide will help you understand the workflow of mocking in C++, the benefits of interaction verification, and how GoogleMock’s expressive syntax empowers you to control and validate complex behaviors.

## 1. Why Use Mock Objects?

Imagine you’re working on a C++ application where certain components depend on external systems or complex modules. Testing your component in isolation can be challenging if those dependencies are expensive, unreliable, or unavailable during testing.

**Mock objects** solve this by:

- Replacing real dependencies with controllable stand-ins.
- Letting you specify expected interactions, including method calls, arguments, and call order.
- Facilitating tests that are fast, reliable, and expressive.

GoogleMock automates mock creation and interaction verification, turning tedious manual mocks into a smooth, expressive experience.

## 2. Creating a Mock Class

### 2.1 Define Interfaces to Mock

Start by coding to an interface (abstract class) which declares virtual methods. For example:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
  virtual void GoTo(int x, int y) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
  virtual int GetY() const = 0;
};
```

A virtual destructor is critical to avoid memory leaks.

### 2.2 Derive a Mock Class

Derive a class from the interface and use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to mock the virtual methods:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>  // Brings in gMock macros

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

Note:

- `MOCK_METHOD` parameters break down the return type, method name, argument list, and optional qualifiers such as `const` or `override`.
- Only public mock methods work correctly with GoogleMock’s macros, even if the original methods are protected/private.

## 3. Using Mock Objects in Tests

### 3.1 Typical Workflow

1. **Include GoogleMock Namespace**

```cpp
using ::testing::_;  // For matchers like _ (wildcard)
using ::testing::AtLeast;  // For cardinality specifications
using ::testing::Return;  // For return values in actions
```

2. **Create Mock Objects**

```cpp
MockTurtle turtle;
```

3. **Set Expectations**

You specify which methods you expect to be called, how often, with what arguments, and optionally what they return or do.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
    .Times(AtLeast(1));

EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(_))  // Accept any int argument
    .Times(3);

EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
    .WillOnce(Return(100))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(200));
```

4. **Exercise Code Under Test**

For example:

```cpp
Painter painter(&turtle);
EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
```

5. **Verify Interactions**

At mock object destruction, GoogleMock automatically verifies all expectations.

### 3.2 Understanding Matchers

- Use `_` to match any argument.
- Use precise values to check specific arguments, e.g. `Forward(100)`.
- Use other built-in matchers like `Gt()`, `Le()`, `NotNull()`, and custom matchers for fine control.

### 3.3 Controlling Call Cardinality

- `Times(0)` asserts a function is **never** called.
- `Times(AnyNumber())` allows any number of calls.
- `AtLeast(n)` ensures at least *n* calls happen.

Omit `Times()` and GoogleMock infers one call expected.

### 3.4 Specifying Call Order

By default, calls may occur in any order. Use `InSequence` to enforce strict call orders:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
}
```

This expects calls in the exact order specified.

## 4. Practical Example: Testing a Painter Class

Suppose you have a class `Painter` that uses a `Turtle` interface to draw.

```cpp
class Painter {
 public:
  explicit Painter(Turtle* turtle) : turtle_(turtle) {}

  bool DrawCircle(int x, int y, int radius) {
    turtle_->PenDown();
    // Simplified drawing logic
    turtle_->Forward(radius);
    turtle_->Turn(90);
    turtle_->Forward(radius);
    turtle_->PenUp();
    return true;
  }

 private:
  Turtle* turtle_;
};
```

To test `Painter` without a real `Turtle`:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::AtLeast;

TEST(PainterTest, CanDrawCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(_)).Times(2);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Turn(90)).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp()).Times(1);

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
}
```

This test explicitly verifies that the right sequence of calls occurs to the `Turtle`.

## 5. Tips and Best Practices

- **Set expectations before exercising the mock.** Calling methods on mocks before `EXPECT_CALL()` is undefined behavior.
- **Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers** to change behavior on uninteresting calls:
  - `NiceMock` suppresses warnings on unexpected calls.
  - `StrictMock` turns unexpected calls into test failures.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
```

- **Avoid overly strict expectations** (like exact argument matches) to prevent brittle tests.
- **Use matchers to specify only relevant argument constraints.**
- **Use sequences to enforce order but only when necessary.**
- **Group related expectations in `InSequence` blocks** to improve readability.
- **Verify expectations are satisfied automatically by default;** use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(mock_ptr);` if needed.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Mock methods call real implementations:** Ensure the base class methods are virtual.
- **Uninteresting call warnings:** Imply missing `EXPECT_CALL()` or switch to `NiceMock`.
- **Multiple calls exceeding expectation:** Check that `.Times(n)` and `.WillOnce()` clauses are consistent.
- **Order-related failures:** Use `InSequence` explicitly if call order matters.

### Debugging Tools

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls and expectation matches.
- Use descriptive `EXPECT_CALL` clauses to isolate failing calls.
