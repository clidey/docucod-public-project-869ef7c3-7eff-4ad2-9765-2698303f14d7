# Test Structure and Discovery

Efficiently organizing your test code, leveraging GoogleTest's automatic test discovery, and setting up suites are key to scalable and maintainable testing. This guide presents clear workflows and actionable strategies to help you design your test structure effectively.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Structure and Discovery

### What This Guide Will Help You Achieve
This guide helps you organize your test code in a clear, maintainable way and understand how GoogleTest automatically discovers tests to run. You’ll learn how to group tests into suites, use fixtures, and leverage naming conventions to let GoogleTest find and execute your tests without manual intervention.

### Prerequisites
- A working C++ development environment with GoogleTest integrated.
- Basic familiarity with test writing in GoogleTest (e.g., `TEST` macros).

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will be able to:
- Structure your test code logically using test suites and fixtures.
- Understand how GoogleTest discovers tests across your codebase.
- Scale your tests by grouping related test cases, improving readability and management.
- Prevent common pitfalls in test discovery and organization.

### Time Estimate
15-30 minutes depending on current familiarity and project complexity.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Designing Your Test Suites and Test Discovery Flow

### 2.1 What is a Test Suite?
A *test suite* is a collection of logically related tests, usually grouped by the module or functionality they test. GoogleTest groups tests by the first argument to the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros. For example:

```cpp
TEST(MathUtils, Factorial) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}

TEST(MathUtils, IsPrime) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));
}
```

Both tests belong to the `MathUtils` test suite.

### 2.2 Test Fixtures for Sharing Setup
If multiple tests share common setup or teardown logic, define a test fixture class inheriting from `testing::Test`:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code here runs before each test
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Code here runs after each test
  }
  // Shared data members
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestOne) {
  // Test code here
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestTwo) {
  // Test code here
}
```

### 2.3 Naming Tests for Automatic Discovery
GoogleTest discovers tests based on these macros:
- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` — for simple tests.
- `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` — for tests using shared fixtures.

GoogleTest scans your compiled test binary for these definitions and runs them automatically when you execute `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### 2.4 Organizational Best Practices
- **Group related tests into suites** using consistent naming based on the module or class under test.
- **Use test fixtures** to set up shared resources rather than repeating code.
- **Avoid overly generic suites**; keep suites focused and manageable.
- **Name your test cases meaningfully** to reflect what aspect is being tested.

### 2.5 Test Discovery Flow Diagram

  A[Write TEST or TEST_F macro] --> B{Compile test binary}

```

This illustrates how GoogleTest automatically collects the tests you defined and executes them.

## 3. Step-by-Step: Creating Organized Test Suites With Discovery

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Clear Test Suites">
Group your tests logically by component or functionality:

```cpp
TEST(NetworkUtils, CanConnect) {
  ...
}
TEST(NetworkUtils, HandlesTimeout) {
  ...
}
```

This lets GoogleTest discover all network-related tests under `NetworkUtils`.

</Step>
<Step title="Create Test Fixtures for Shared Setup">
Declare a fixture class when multiple tests share setup or teardown code:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    OpenTestDatabase();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    CloseTestDatabase();
  }
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertsDataCorrectly) { ... }
TEST_F(DatabaseTest, RetrievesDataCorrectly) { ... }
```

</Step>
<Step title="Follow GoogleTest Naming Conventions">
Ensure test suites & tests follow GoogleTest's simple naming rules — valid C++ identifiers without underscores for test or fixture names.

This helps GoogleTest map and report tests cleanly.
</Step>
<Step title="Compile and Run Your Tests">
Compile your tests as part of your build. Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` to run them:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Upon execution, GoogleTest discovers and executes all tests defined with `TEST` and `TEST_F`.

</Step>
<Step title="Validate Test Discovery Output">
Run your tests and observe the console output for test counts and names to confirm discovery:

```
[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from NetworkUtils
[ RUN      ] NetworkUtils.CanConnect
[       OK ] NetworkUtils.CanConnect (2 ms)
...
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

### Use Fixtures Sparingly
Overusing fixtures can lead to complex dependencies. Only use them when tests share substantial setup logic.

### Beware Test Dependencies
Each test gets a fresh fixture instance — do not expect state to persist between tests.

### Avoid Overly Generic Test Names
Names like `Test1`, `Test2` are ambiguous and hamper maintainability and reporting.

### Understand Test Discovery Limitations
GoogleTest discovers only tests defined with its macros in compiled binaries. Dynamic runtime-registered tests require special consideration.

### Run Tests Selectively When Needed
Use command line filters to run subsets of tests:

```
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=NetworkUtils.*
```

### Keep Test Suites Focused
Large suites can slow test runs and obscure failures. Modularize test suites by components.

### Clean Up Resources in Fixtures
Ensure resource allocation in `SetUp()` is paired with cleanup in `TearDown()` to avoid resource leaks.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Discovered
- Verify test functions use `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros.
- Check that test source files are compiled and linked.
- Ensure `main()` initializes GoogleTest and calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Tests Not Running as Expected
- Confirm your test names follow GoogleTest naming constraints.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to list discovered tests.

### Duplicate or Conflicting Test Names
- Make sure test suite and test names do not collide within binaries.

### Skipped Tests
- If tests are disabled via `DISABLED_` prefix or filters, they won't run; remove those to re-enable.

<Check>
Ensure each test file includes necessary headers such as `<gtest/gtest.h>` and correctly registers tests with `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros.
</Check>

<Note>
Automatic test discovery relies on compiled test binaries; make sure all test source files are included in your build system.
