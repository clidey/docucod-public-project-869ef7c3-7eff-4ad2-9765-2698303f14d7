# Writing and Discovering Tests

## Overview

This guide helps you understand the structure and organization of tests within GoogleTest, how automatic test discovery works, and best practices for writing meaningful, maintainable test cases. It also explains how GoogleTest registers your tests, discovers them at runtime, and provides strategies to group and scale your test suites effectively.

By following this guide, you will be able to write clear and well-organized tests that integrate smoothly with GoogleTest’s automatic discovery mechanism, making your testing process more efficient and scalable.

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- Installed GoogleTest and have it available in your build environment.
- Basic understanding of C++ and familiarity with classes and functions.
- Awareness of virtual functions and test fixtures in GoogleTest.
- Optionally, familiarity with mock objects if you plan to test interactions.

---

## What You Will Achieve

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Know how to write simple and complex tests compatible with GoogleTest.
- Understand how GoogleTest discovers tests automatically during runtime.
- Learn best practices to organize tests and group them logically.
- Know how to register tests permanently with the framework without manual enumeration.

## How GoogleTest Discovers Tests

### The Test Macro and Structure

Tests in GoogleTest are defined using macros like `TEST` and `TEST_F` (for fixtures). Each test consists of a test suite (formerly called a test case) name and a test name, which uniquely identify the test within the executable.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, FactorialDoesZero) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialization code
  }
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, HandlesNegative) {
  EXPECT_THROW(Factorial(-5), std::domain_error);
}
```

### Registration at Compile Time

When you define a test using these macros, GoogleTest automatically registers the test in a global registry during static initialization before `main()` runs. This eliminates any need for manual test enumeration.

- Each test fixture or test case class is internally registered with test names.
- Macros generate factory functions and metadata enabling easy instantiation when running tests.

### Runtime Test Discovery

At runtime, GoogleTest queries this registry to discover all tests, enabling the test runner to list, filter, and run tests dynamically without requiring source code changes or recompilation.

Users can run all tests or select subsets by name patterns or filters.

## Writing Meaningful Tests

### Structuring Your Tests

- **Group related tests into suites**: Use descriptive suite names that capture the feature or class under test.
- **Name tests clearly**: Test names should briefly but precisely describe the behavior or scenario being tested.
- **Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) for shared setup**: When multiple tests share initialization or teardown logic, leverage fixtures to reduce duplication.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, FactorialOfPositiveNumber)
TEST(MathTest, FactorialOfZero)

class FactorialTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // common init
  }
};

TEST_F(FactorialTest, HandlesNegativeInput) {
  // test negative input behavior
}
```

### Best Practices for Test Case Design

- **Keep tests atomic**: Each test should check one specific behavior or requirement.
- **Use clear expectations**: Use `EXPECT_` or `ASSERT_` macros to verify outcomes with detailed failure messages.
- **Avoid side effects between tests**: GoogleTest creates a new test instance for each test, so tests should be independent.
- **Leverage parameterized tests** when checking the same behavior with varying inputs.

---

## Registering Tests and Test Fixtures

GoogleTest relies on static initialization for test discovery, so:

- Define tests using `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros; no manual calls are needed.
- Test fixtures should derive from `::testing::Test` and be declared before use.
- Ensure constructors and `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` are correctly implemented for shared setup/cleanup.

---

## Grouping and Organizing Tests

### Test Suites

Group related tests into suites using the first argument to the `TEST` macro. This logically bundles tests for easy navigation and focused execution:

```cpp
TEST(StringUtilsTest, HandlesEmptyString) { ... }
TEST(StringUtilsTest, HandlesNullInput) { ... }
```

### Test Fixtures

Use fixtures when multiple tests share setup or teardown steps.

- Define a class inheriting from `::testing::Test`.
- Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.
- Use `TEST_F` instead of `TEST` to run tests with the fixture.

This encourages code reuse and clean tests.

### Parameterized Tests

For testing the same logic over multiple data points, use parameterized tests to reduce duplication and improve coverage.

(See the [Parameterized and Typed Tests](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/testing-core/parametrized-tests) guide for details.)

---

## Discovering Tests Automatically

After compiling your test binary, GoogleTest will:

- Enumerate registered tests and display them when invoked with flags such as `--gtest_list_tests`.
- Allow selective test execution using `--gtest_filter`.
- Automatically run all tests when no filter is provided.

This automatic discovery ensures seamless test scalability, especially for large codebases with numerous tests.

---

## Tips for Scaling Test Coverage

- **Keep tests grouped logically** so you can run subsets efficiently.
- **Use filters** to focus on relevant tests during development.
- **Write concise and descriptive test names** to avoid confusion and aid test filtering.
- **Favor parameterized tests** over writing repetitive, similar tests.
- **Leverage fixtures to avoid redundant setup code** and make tests cleaner.

---

## Troubleshooting Test Discovery

### Common Issues

- **Tests not running or appearing:** Ensure tests use the proper `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros and that they are linked into the test executable.
- **Static initialization order problems:** Avoid complex code in global or static objects outside of tests; prefer initialization inside fixtures.
- **Test suite or test name collisions:** Check that suite and test names are unique.
- **Failure to link test code:** Confirm your build system includes all necessary source files.

### Practical Advice

- Run your test executable with `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm which tests are discovered.
- Use verbose flags `--gtest_verbose=info` when things seem amiss.
- Check that your `main()` calls `::testing::InitGoogleTest()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

## Example: Writing and Running Your First Test

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Function under test
int Factorial(int n) {
  return (n <= 1) ? 1 : n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

// A basic test case.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and run:

```
$ ./factorial_test
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from FactorialTest ran. (0 ms total)
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This is the fundamental pattern for writing and running GoogleTest tests.
