# Organizing and Running Test Suites

## Workflow Overview

GoogleTest provides a powerful framework for grouping related tests into *test suites*, enabling organized, scalable, and maintainable test code. This guide helps you learn how to structure your tests effectively, leverage automatic test discovery, and run your tests efficiently.

### What You'll Achieve
- Group multiple test cases logically using test suites.
- Understand naming conventions to maximize readability.
- Use GoogleTest's test discovery and filtering features.
- Run tests with various options to suit your workflow.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of writing tests using GoogleTest (`TEST` macro).
- GoogleTest installed and configured in your development environment.

### Time Estimate
Getting comfortable with organizing tests and running them should take about 15–30 minutes.

### Skill Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 1. Defining and Grouping Test Suites

### Using `TEST` Macro to Define a Test Suite
Each test case belongs to a test suite which groups tests logically.

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestCaseName) {
  // Test code goes here
  EXPECT_EQ(42, ComputeAnswer());
}
```

- `TestSuiteName` is the suite grouping related tests together.
- `TestCaseName` identifies the individual test within the suite.

**Best Practice:** Choose suite names that reflect the feature or class under test, and descriptive test case names for what each test verifies.

### Using `TEST_F` and Fixtures for Shared State
If multiple tests share the same setup, use a test fixture:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* common setup */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* cleanup */ }

  // Shared data
  int shared_value_ = 0;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, Test1) {
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_value_, 0);
  // ... test using shared fixture
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, Test2) {
  // Another test with same setup
}
```

This groups tests logically while avoiding redundant setup code.

---

## 2. Test Discovery and Listing

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests declared with the `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros that are linked into your test executable.

To list all discovered tests without running them, run:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

This prints test suites and their test cases:

```
TestSuiteName.
  TestCaseName
  AnotherTestCase
AnotherSuite.
  TestCase
```

---

## 3. Running Tests

Run all tests in your executable:

```bash
./my_test_binary
```

### Running Specific Tests
You can limit test execution using the `--gtest_filter` flag. It supports wildcards (`*`). For example:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestCaseName
```

Run all tests in a suite:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.*
```

Exclude a test:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=-TestSuiteName.UnwantedTest
```

Combine include and exclude patterns using colon separators:

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=SuiteA.*:SuiteB.*-*.FlakyTest
```

### Parallel Running
GoogleTest does not provide built-in parallel test execution, but you can use external tools like `ctest` or `bazel` to run multiple tests in parallel.

---

## 4. Naming Guidelines

### Test Suite Naming
- Use names reflecting the class or functionality under test.
- Prefer `CamelCase` or `PascalCase` for suites.

### Test Case Naming
- Describe what the test verifies in natural language.
- Use underscores to separate words for readability, e.g., `HandlesNullInput`.

### Avoid overly generic or excessively long names.

---

## 5. Scaling Your Tests

### Organizing Tests Across Files
- Place related test suites in corresponding `.cc` files.
- File names should reflect the primary test suite or component tested.

### Using Test Fixtures Across Files
- Fixtures can be declared in header files and used across multiple test files.

---

## 6. Test Suite Setup and Teardown

Sometimes you need global setup or teardown for all tests in a suite.

### Using Test Fixtures’ `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Code to set up once for the whole suite
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Code to clean up once after the suite
  }
};
```

These static functions run once before and after **all** tests in that suite.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- **Keep tests independent**: Avoid shared state that can cause inter-test dependencies.
- **Use descriptive names** to clearly communicate what each test checks.
- **Use test fixtures** for repeated setups or state.
- **Group related tests** to improve maintainability and navigation.
- **Leverage filtering flags** for faster iterative testing.
- **Run all tests frequently** to avoid regression.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Discovered
- Verify that `TEST` macros are correctly defined.
- Ensure test executable is linked with the GoogleTest library.
- For templates or advanced patterns, explicit instantiation or registration might be needed.

### Tests Not Running When Filtered
- Check spelling and case sensitivity in `--gtest_filter`.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` for available test names.

### Slow Test Execution
- Use filtering to run subsets.
- Break large test suites into smaller ones.
