# Your First GoogleTest: Quickstart Workflow

## Workflow Overview

This guide walks you through the essential steps to set up GoogleTest in your C++ project, create your first test cases, and run them to validate your code. It enables you to quickly confirm that GoogleTest is installed correctly and that your test environment works as expected.

**Prerequisites**
- A development environment with a C++17 capable compiler.
- GoogleTest source code or installed libraries.
- Familiarity with basic C++ project setup.
- CMake installed if using CMake-based builds.

**Expected Outcome**
- A running test executable that compiles GoogleTest, executes tests, and outputs results.
- Confidence that your project is properly integrated with the GoogleTest framework.

**Time Estimate**
Approximately 15â€“30 minutes depending on setup familiarity.

**Difficulty Level**
Beginner-friendly, suitable for developers new to GoogleTest.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Obtain GoogleTest

If you haven't yet, clone or download the GoogleTest repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
dcd googletest
```

Alternatively, you can use pre-installed libraries or package managers.

---

### 2. Build GoogleTest

Using CMake is the recommended method:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

This command builds GoogleTest and its companion GoogleMock by default.

**Tips:**
- To build only GoogleTest without GoogleMock, run `cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF`.
- On Unix-like systems, `make` can also be used after generating build files.

---

### 3. Integrate GoogleTest Into Your Project

If you are building a standalone test executable, link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to get a `main()` function that runs all tests.

Example CMake snippet:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
add_executable(my_test_executable test_file.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test_executable GTest::gtest_main)
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_test_executable)
```

If you want to incorporate GoogleTest directly into your project source tree, consider using `add_subdirectory()` to include the GoogleTest source.

---

### 4. Write Your First Test Case

Create a C++ source file, e.g., `hello_test.cpp`, with the following content:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Define a simple test named HelloTest, with a test case Foo
TEST(HelloTest, Foo) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}

// Another example test
TEST(HelloTest, Bar) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

This example demonstrates basic assertions:
- `EXPECT_EQ` checks equality.
- `EXPECT_TRUE` verifies a boolean condition.

---

### 5. Build Your Test Executable

Compile your test source file and link against GoogleTest. Example using g++ manually:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread \
    hello_test.cpp \
    /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a \
    -o hello_test
```

Or use CMake with the example build snippet in step 3.

---

### 6. Run Your Tests

Execute the test binary:

```bash
./hello_test
```

You will see output similar to:

```
Running main() from gtest_main.cc
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[ RUN      ] HelloTest.Foo
[       OK ] HelloTest.Foo (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] HelloTest.Bar
[       OK ] HelloTest.Bar (0 ms)
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

If you see passing test output, your GoogleTest setup is successful.

---

### 7. (Optional) Adding GoogleMock

To mock interfaces and methods, include the GoogleMock header and link against `gmock_main`:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
```

Link with `gmock_main` to get a main function that initializes both GoogleMock and GoogleTest:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_test_executable GTest::gmock_main)
```

---

## Verification

After running `./hello_test`, confirm:
- Tests execute without errors.
- The expected number of tests run matches your test code.
- Output reflects successful assertions.

If tests fail or do not run, revisit build flags, linking, and include paths.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`** librarysto avoid writing your own `main()` function.
- **Keep tests small and focused;** each `TEST` should validate a specific behavior.
- **Enable verbose output** for debugging with the flag `--gtest_verbose=info`.
- Use CMake `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` for smoother integration.
- Avoid mixing debug and release builds between your project and GoogleTest.

## Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Linker errors due to missing main()">
Make sure to link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to provide the main test runner. Linking just `gtest` requires you to define `main()` manually.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler version not supporting C++17">
GoogleTest requires C++17 or later. Update your compiler or configure your build to use the appropriate standard flag `-std=c++17`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing include paths">
Verify include directories for GoogleTest headers are correctly set in your build environment. Using CMake's `find_package` handles this automatically.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests not running or found">
Confirm that your test cases use the `TEST` macro and are linked properly. The test binary must be run to execute tests.
</Accordion>

## Example Summary

Here's a minimal working example of a basic GoogleTest program to get you started quickly:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and run it as described above to see GoogleTest in action.
