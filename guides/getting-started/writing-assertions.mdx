# Writing Effective Test Assertions

Explore the variety of built-in assertions in GoogleTest and best practices for expressing expectations and conditions. This guide focuses on making your test statements clear, maintainable, and meaningful, helping you write tests that accurately describe your code's intended behavior.

---

## 1. Understanding GoogleTest Assertions

GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertion macros to verify the behavior of your code during testing. These assertions serve as your main tool to check conditions, compare values, and enforce correctness.

### Key Assertion Types

- **Non-fatal vs. Fatal Assertions**: Most macros come in pairs: `EXPECT_` (non-fatal) and `ASSERT_` (fatal). When an `EXPECT_` assertion fails, the test continues, allowing multiple errors to be reported in one run. An `ASSERT_` failure aborts the current function immediately.

- **Streaming Custom Messages**: All assertions support streaming extra failure message details with the `<<` operator to clarify failure reasons.

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Validation failed for input: " << input_value;
```

### Categories of Assertions

- **Boolean Conditions**: Check simple true or false conditions.

- **Binary Comparisons**: Compare two values, e.g., equality, inequality, less than, greater than.

- **String Comparisons**: Specialized assertions for comparing C-style strings, including case-insensitive matches.

- **Floating-Point Comparisons**: Compare floats and doubles accounting for rounding errors.

- **Exception Assertions**: Confirm that code throws or does not throw expected exceptions.

- **Predicate Assertions**: Use user-defined predicates to express complex, domain-specific conditions with better messages.

- **Death Assertions**: Validate that code terminates the process as expected under certain conditions.

- **Explicit Success and Failure**: Allow you to signal success or failure directly for flow control within tests.

For a definitive list of all assertions, see the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md).

## 2. Crafting Assertions: Practical Workflow

This section guides you through the process of writing test assertions that are precise, readable, and maintainable.

### Step 1: Choose the Right Assertion Macro

- Use `EXPECT_` macros to continue testing after a failure.
- Use `ASSERT_` macros when the test cannot proceed meaningfully after failure.

### Step 2: Write Clear and Specific Conditions

- Prefer specific assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_TRUE` with clear conditions rather than generic `EXPECT_TRUE` with complicated expressions.
- Use the right assertion for your data types: e.g., use `EXPECT_STREQ` for C strings instead of `EXPECT_EQ`.

### Step 3: Stream Additional Context

- Append relevant variable values and context to failure messages using streaming to aid future debugging.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Failed for inputs a=" << a << ", b=" << b;
```

### Step 4: Consider Using Matchers for Complex Checks

- `EXPECT_THAT` with rich matchers lets you express detailed verification in an English-readable way.
- Example: `EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)))` asserts value is between 5 and 10.

### Step 5: Use Predicate and Predicate-Formatter Assertions When Needed

- If built-in assertions do not suffice, define custom predicates returning `bool` or a GoogleTest `AssertionResult` for expressive messages.

## 3. Assertion Macro Examples

### Boolean Assertions

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_ready);
ASSERT_FALSE(has_error);
```

### Equality Checks

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_count, expected_count);
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr);
```

### Floating-Point Comparisons

```cpp
EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(result_float, 3.14f);
EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(result_double, 3.1415926535);
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated_value, expected_value, 0.01);
```

### String Comparisons

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(c_str1, c_str2);
ASSERT_STRCASEEQ(c_str1, c_str2_case_insensitive);
```

### Exception Assertions

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionThatThrows(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(FunctionThatMightThrow());
```

### Predicate Assertions

```cpp
// Custom predicate function
bool IsPrime(int n);
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPrime, candidate_number);
```

### Advanced Example Using Matchers

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;

EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(100))) << "Value out of expected range.";
```

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Prefer `EXPECT_` over `ASSERT_`** unless continuing the test after failure is nonsensical.
- **Choose the assertion variant that best matches your intent.** For example, use string-specific assertions for C strings.
- **Avoid overly complex expressions inside assertions.** Break them into understandable parts or use predicate assertions.
- **Use descriptive failure messages.** Include the actual values that caused the failure.
- **Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers** to improve readability and expressiveness.
- **Validate floating-point comparisons carefully** to avoid false failures due to rounding.
- **Use predicate-format assertions** for highly customized failure output.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Pitfalls

### Problem: Test Fails Without Useful Message

- **Cause:** Using a simple `EXPECT_TRUE` on complex conditions without custom messages.
- **Solution:** Use predicate assertions or append meaningful messages.

### Problem: Comparing C Strings with `EXPECT_EQ` Shows Pointer Equality

- **Cause:** `EXPECT_EQ` compares string pointers, not string contents.
- **Solution:** Use `EXPECT_STREQ` or `EXPECT_THAT` with appropriate string matchers.

### Problem: Floating-Point Equality Fails Due to Precision

- **Cause:** Direct `EXPECT_EQ` for floats.
- **Solution:** Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` / `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR`.

### Problem: Assertion Fails but Test Continues Unexpectedly

- **Cause:** Using `EXPECT_*` instead of `ASSERT_*` in critical failure points.
- **Solution:** Identify when failure must abort and use `ASSERT_*` accordingly.

### Tips on Debugging

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` or `testing::ScopedTrace` to add contextual information.
- Use GoogleTest's output to identify the exact location and cause of failures.
