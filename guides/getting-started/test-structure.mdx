# Organizing Tests and Test Suites

GoogleTest provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your tests into logical groups and hierarchies known as test suites and fixtures. This page guides you through best practices and patterns for grouping related tests, structuring your test files, and leveraging test fixtures for sharing setup and teardown code effectively.

---

## Why Organize Tests?

Imagine working in a large project with hundreds of tests. Organizing your tests allows you to:

- Easily locate and run related tests.
- Share setup code to reduce duplication.
- Understand the structure of tested components.
- Scale your test codebase effectively as it grows.

GoogleTest’s test suite and fixture mechanisms empower you to build such maintainable and meaningful test hierarchies.

## Grouping Tests with Test Suites

### What is a Test Suite?

A *test suite* groups together multiple related tests. Tests within the same suite should logically belong together, such as testing the same class, module, or feature.

- Test suites are identified by their **TestSuiteName** — the first argument in the `TEST()` macro.
- Each test inside the suite is uniquely named by the combination of the TestSuiteName and TestName.
- GoogleTest executes tests grouped by their suites and reports results accordingly.

### Defining Tests in Suites

Use the `TEST()` macro to define tests belonging to a test suite:

```cpp
TEST(MyClassTest, HandlesEmptyInput) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(MyClass().Process("").empty());
}

TEST(MyClassTest, HandlesValidInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(42, MyClass().Process("answer"));
}
```

Both tests belong to the `MyClassTest` suite.

### Naming Guidelines

- Test suite names and test names **must be valid C++ identifiers** and **must not contain underscores (`_`)**. This restriction avoids internal naming collisions and compiler errors.
- Follow your project's usual naming style for classes and functions.

<Note>
Avoid underscores to prevent naming collisions and reserved identifier conflicts in GoogleTest-generated classes.
</Note>

## Sharing Setup Using Test Fixtures

When tests share common objects, variables, or setup code, GoogleTest’s *test fixtures* allow you to write that code once and reuse it across tests.

### Creating a Test Fixture

1. Define a fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
2. Declare shared members and initialize them in the constructor or `SetUp()`.
3. Optionally, implement `TearDown()` or destructor for cleanup.
4. Write tests using `TEST_F()` macro referring to the fixture class.

Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  DatabaseTest() {
    // Initialize database connection
    db.Connect("TestDB");
  }

  ~DatabaseTest() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Called before each test
    db.Clear();
  }

  // Shared resource for all tests.
  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertAndRetrieve) {
  db.Insert("key", "value");
  EXPECT_EQ("value", db.Retrieve("key"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, EmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.IsEmpty());
}
```

Each `TEST_F` gets a fresh instance of `DatabaseTest`, ensuring tests are isolated.

<Check>
Each test uses a new fixture object: constructor → `SetUp()` → test body → `TearDown()` → destructor.
</Check>

### Best Practices

- Use the constructor for simple initialization, especially for `const` members.
- Use `SetUp()` for initialization that may fail or requires assertions.
- Use `TearDown()` (not destructors) for cleanup that may throw exceptions.
- Keep tests independent, avoiding state shared between tests unless properly reset.

## Advanced Grouping: Parameterized and Typed Tests

For scalable and data-driven testing, GoogleTest supports:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests** where tests execute with varied input values.
- **Typed Tests** where the same logic is tested over multiple types.

(These advanced topics are covered in detail in [Parameterized and Typed Tests Guide](/guides/practical-testing-patterns/parameterized-testing).)

---

## Organizing Test Files and Source Layout

How you arrange your test files impacts maintainability and development speed.

### Recommended Structure

- Place each test suite or related group of tests in a separate source file named after the component (e.g., `widget_test.cc` for `Widget` class tests).
- Keep tests for different logical components in different files.
- Use namespaces or directories that mirror your project structure.
- Organize fixtures and helper functions within the test source for clarity.

<Note>
If your fixture class is used across multiple files, declare it in a header file and implement tests in `.cc` files.
</Note>

### Example Layout

```plaintext
project/
  src/
    widget.h
    widget.cc
  tests/
    widget_test.cc
    database_test.cc
```

This clear separation ensures fast navigation and builds.

## Using Test Suites with Shared Setup and Teardown

Sometimes, expensive resources must be shared across *all* tests in a suite.

### Per-Test-Suite Setup and Teardown

GoogleTest lets you define `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` static methods in your fixture class. These are called once before the first test and after the last test in the suite, respectively.

Example:

```cpp
class NetworkTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Establish connection once
    network.Connect("test_server");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    network.Disconnect();
  }

  // Shared resource
  static NetworkConnection network;
};

NetworkConnection NetworkTest::network;

TEST_F(NetworkTest, SendsData) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(network.Send("Hello"));
}
```

Tip: Declare `SetUpTestSuite()` public if you want to use it with `TEST_P`.

---

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Mixing test macros with underscores in names:** Avoid underscores in suite and test names to prevent confusing name collisions.
- **Using uninstantiated parameterized tests:** Always instantiate `TEST_P` suites with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` or suppress failure with `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST`.
- **Not having default constructors for fixtures:** If your fixture has non-default constructors, define a default no-arg constructor.
- **Misnaming setup/teardown methods:** Ensure `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, `SetUpTestSuite()`, `TearDownTestSuite()` are spelled correctly (case-sensitive).
- **Sharing mutable state without reset:** Tests should not affect each other's results via shared state.

---

## Tips for Scaling Test Suites

- **Factor common code into fixture classes** to avoid duplication.
- **Use parameterized tests** for testing multiple inputs without duplication.
- **Group logically related tests** by component or feature for clarity.
- **Avoid overly large test suites:** break them down if they become too big.
- **Use namespaces** if multiple suites use the same names in different scopes.
