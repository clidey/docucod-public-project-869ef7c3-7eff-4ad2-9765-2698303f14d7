# Organizing and Grouping Tests

Efficient organization and grouping of tests are crucial for scaling and maintaining reliable unit test suites as your projects grow. This guide explains key strategies to logically group your tests, define test cases clearly, and apply naming conventions that enhance readability and maintainability.

---

## Why Organize and Group Tests?

Imagine your codebase growing from tens to thousands of tests. Without clear organization, running, locating, and managing these tests becomes chaotic, slowing development and increasing the risk of errors.

Proper test organization helps you:

- **Quickly identify test scope** through logical groupings.
- **Run targeted subsets** of tests relevant to a feature or component.
- **Maintain clear ownership** and responsibilities over test code.
- **Keep test suites scalable** and easy to navigate as new tests are added.

---

## Strategies for Test Grouping

### 1. Use Test Suites and Test Cases

GoogleTest organizes tests hierarchically using **test suites** and **tests (test cases)**:

- **Test Suite**: A named collection of related tests.
- **Test**: A single test method.

Group tests that share setup, purpose, or target module/functionality into the same suite.

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(MathUtils, ParsesValidInput) {
  // Test code ...
}

TEST(MathUtils, HandlesInvalidInput) {
  // Test code ...
}

TEST(StringHelper, HandlesEmptyString) {
  // Test code ...
}
```

Here `'MathUtils'` and `'StringHelper'` are test suites grouping related tests.

### 2. Define Test Fixtures for Shared Setup

If multiple tests share a common environment or setup code, create a test fixture:

```cpp
class DatabaseConnectionTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect("localhost");
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseConnectionTest, ValidQuery) {
  // db is already connected.
}

TEST_F(DatabaseConnectionTest, EmptyResult) {
  // Same setup.
}
```

This groups tests logically and reduces duplication.

### 3. Apply Naming Conventions

Good naming conventions enhance discoverability and intent sharing:

- **Test Suite Names**: Use the class or module name under test.
- **Test Names**: Use descriptive phrases for behavior or case being checked.
- Use CamelCase or snake_case consistently.

**Example:**

`TEST(Parser, HandlesEmptyInput)` clearly indicates intent.

### 4. Organize Tests into Directory Structures

Reflect your production code structure in test directories:

```
/project
  /src
    /math
    /string
  /test
    /math
    /string
```

This structure scales and helps developers find tests related to specific components.

### 5. Logical Grouping Techniques

Within large test suites:

- Use **nested suites** or prefixes to group related functionality.
- Use **parameterized tests** to cover multiple cases efficiently without code duplication.

---

## Best Practices for Scalable Test Suites

- **Keep tests small and focused**: One behavior or condition per test.
- **Limit shared setup** to what is necessary, use fixtures judiciously.
- **Document test purpose** clearly in test names and comments.
- **Avoid overly strict expectations** to reduce brittleness.
- Utilize mock objects effectively to isolate system components.

---

## Real-World Example

Here's an example reflecting a growing project:

```cpp
// Interface
class Calculator {
public:
  virtual ~Calculator() = default;
  virtual int Add(int a, int b) = 0;
  virtual int Divide(int a, int b) = 0;
};

// Mock class
class MockCalculator : public Calculator {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Divide, (int a, int b), (override));
};

// Grouped tests
TEST(CalculatorAddTests, HandlesPositiveNumbers) {
  MockCalculator calc;
  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Add(3, 7)).WillOnce(Return(10));
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(3, 7), 10);
}

TEST(CalculatorDivideTests, HandlesDivisionByZero) {
  MockCalculator calc;
  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Divide(_, 0)).WillRepeatedly([](int, int){
    throw std::runtime_error("division by zero");
  });

  EXPECT_THROW(calc.Divide(5, 0), std::runtime_error);
}
```

This maintains a clean separation between tests for addition and division.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mixing unrelated tests in one suite**: Makes it harder to locate and maintain.
- **Overusing fixtures for unrelated tests**: Can introduce unnecessary dependencies.
- **Unclear naming**: Impedes fast understanding of test purpose.
- **Too many expectations per test**: Leads to brittle and hard-to-debug failures.

---

## Troubleshooting

If tests become hard to manage or flaky:

- Review your grouping: Can suites be split further?
- Check for dependencies between tests that cause brittleness.
- Ensure tests do not rely on execution order unless explicitly specified.
- Use mock strictness levels (e.g., `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) to control warning verbosity for uninteresting calls.
