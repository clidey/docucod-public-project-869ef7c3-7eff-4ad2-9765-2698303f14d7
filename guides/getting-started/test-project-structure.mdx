# Test Project Structure and Initialization

## Overview

This guide helps you set up your GoogleTest projects with a recommended folder and test suite organization, enabling scalable and maintainable test development. It details practical approaches to structuring source and test directories, grouping tests, and initializing test environments to maximize efficiency and clarity.

## 1. Organizing Test Files and Folders

### Purpose
Organizing your testing codebase logically helps maintain clarity as your project grows. Proper structure aids in navigation, builds, and test maintenance.

### Recommended Folder Structure

- **`src/`**: Your main source code files.
- **`tests/`**: All test files are stored here.
  - **`unit/`**: Unit tests for individual components.
  - **`integration/`**: Integration tests combining components.
  - **`mocks/`**: Definitions of mock classes and related test utilities.

Example directory layout:

```text
project_root/
├── src/
│   ├── foo.cpp
│   └── foo.h
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── foo_test.cc
│   │   └── bar_test.cc
│   ├── integration/
│   │   └── system_test.cc
│   └── mocks/
│       └── mock_foo.h
└── CMakeLists.txt
```

### Benefits

- Segregation of production and test code.
- Easier integration with build tools, especially CMake and Bazel.
- Logical grouping of tests by type and purpose (unit, integration, mocks).

### Tips

- Place mock class declarations in the `mocks/` directory if they are shared across multiple tests.
- Avoid bloating test files; keep each focused on a specific subject.

## 2. Structuring Test Suites

### Test Class per Component

Derive one or more test fixture classes for each component or unit being tested. This promotes focused, isolated testing and better reusability of test setup logic.

### Test Suite Naming

- Name test fixtures clearly after the class or function under test.
- Use descriptive test names that specify the behavior or scenario tested.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup for Foo tests
  }

  Foo foo_;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, ReturnsPositiveValue) {
  EXPECT_GT(foo_.Compute(5), 0);
}

TEST_F(FooTest, ThrowsOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_THROW(foo_.Compute(-1), std::invalid_argument);
}
```

### Putting Tests Together

Group related test cases in the same file unless the file becomes excessively large. Consider splitting tests logically to keep files maintainable.

### Test Fixtures and Reusability

Reuse test fixtures whenever multiple tests share common setup or teardown procedures. This reduces duplication and improves clarity.

## 3. Initialization Patterns

### Test Initialization

Leverage GoogleTest's fixture system (`SetUp()` and `TearDown()`) for per-test initialization and cleanup. For one-time setup and teardown, use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` (GoogleTest 1.10+).

Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Connect to database once for all tests
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Disconnect database
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Per-test preparation
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Per-test cleanup
  }
};
```

### Using Test Fixtures for Mock Initialization

Initialize mocks in the test fixture constructor or `SetUp()`. For example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  MockBar mock_bar;

  void SetUp() override {
    ON_CALL(mock_bar, DoSomething()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  }
};
```

This ensures that each test starts with a clean and properly configured mock environment.

### Avoiding Global State

Each test should be independent and side-effect free. Avoid global or static state unless carefully managed. Use test fixtures to encapsulate state.

## 4. Building and Running Tests

### Integration with Build Systems

- Place test source files and mock definitions in dedicated directories.
- Use best practices in `CMakeLists.txt` or `BUILD` files for clarity and correctness.


Example CMake snippet:

```cmake
add_executable(foo_test tests/unit/foo_test.cc src/foo.cpp)
target_link_libraries(foo_test gtest gmock pthread)
add_test(NAME foo_test COMMAND foo_test)
```

### Test Naming Conventions

Choose descriptive and consistent naming conventions for executables and test cases to streamline running tests and reporting results.

## 5. Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Set expectations before calling mock methods:** Always declare `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising mocks to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Mock classes location:** Put shared mocks in a separate `mocks` directory to avoid duplication.
- **One mock per collaborate:** Avoid mocking classes you do not own, or isolate the mocking in your code via adaptors.
- **Use namespaces:** Avoid polluting the global namespace in test code.
- **Avoid overly strict expectations:** Use `NiceMock` or catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` to avoid brittle tests.

## 6. Troubleshooting Initialization and Structure Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Initialization and Structure Issues">
<Accordion title="Tests Failing Due to Missing Setup">
Sometimes forgetting to call base class `SetUp()` or not initializing mocks leads to unexplained failures.

**Solution**: Always call base `SetUp()` at start of your override, and initialize mocks in the fixture constructor or `SetUp()`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Too Many or Missing Mock Declarations">
Tests may break when mocking classes scattered across test sources without a common header.

**Solution**: Centralize common mock declarations in `tests/mocks/` directory.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Being Discovered">
Build configuration or naming conventions could prevent tests from running.

**Solution**: Verify `add_test()` calls and test executable naming. Consult your build system docs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Affected by Global State">
Shared global variables can cause flakiness.

**Solution**: Refactor to per-test fixture state. Reset global state in each test's `SetUp` or use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for isolation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 7. Next Steps & Additional Resources

- Review the [Mocking Reference](../api-reference/core-apis/mocking.md) to learn about mock creation and usage patterns.
- Consult the [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for recipes on advanced mocking techniques.
- Explore the [Quickstart with CMake](../guides/getting-started/quickstart-cmake.md) or [Quickstart with Bazel](../guides/getting-started/quickstart-bazel.md) for build integration.
- Practice writing and running basic tests following [Authoring Basic Unit Tests](../guides/writing-and-running-tests/basic-unit-tests.md).

## Summary

Proper project organization, test grouping, and initialization is key to scalable and maintainable use of GoogleTest. This guide aligns your test codebase structure with best practices, leveraging fixtures, mock separation, and build integration to reduce complexity and increase clarity.
