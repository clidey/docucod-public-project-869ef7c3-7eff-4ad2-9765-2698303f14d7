# Test Discovery and Organization

## Introduction

This guide helps you understand how GoogleTest automatically discovers tests in your project, best practices to organize test code effectively, and strategies for managing increasingly large test suites. You will learn recommended directory structures, naming conventions, and how to scale your testing infrastructure smoothly.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest usage and test writing.
- A configured build setup that integrates GoogleTest (see [Installation and Setup](/guides/getting-started/installation-and-setup)).
- Access to your project source code and build files.

### Expected Outcome

After following this guide, you will:
- Understand how GoogleTest detects and runs tests automatically.
- Apply best practices for organizing test files and directories.
- Employ naming conventions that improve test discoverability and maintenance.
- Plan test suite organization and scaling strategies as your project grows.

### Time Estimate

Approximately 20–30 minutes to read and apply the guidelines.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## 1. Understanding GoogleTest's Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest discovers tests by scanning linked test binaries and registering all tests defined using its macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and related mechanisms. This registration happens at static initialization time, so no manual test enumeration is required.

### How It Works:

- Each `TEST` macro invocation defines a test that registers itself with GoogleTest during program initialization.
- When running tests (`RUN_ALL_TESTS()`), GoogleTest executes all registered tests found in the linked binaries.
- Test selection and filtering can be controlled via command line flags (e.g., `--gtest_filter`).

### What This Means For You:

- Your tests will be automatically detected as long as they are compiled and linked correctly.
- You do not need to create a test registry or list tests explicitly.
- To test a subset, use filtering or test sharding environment variables.

<Tip>
To see all discovered tests without running them, run your test executable with `--gtest_list_tests`. This can help verify the test discovery during setup.
</Tip>

## 2. Best Practices for Organizing Test Code

Well-organized test code improves maintainability, clarity, and test execution efficiency. Here are the recommended approaches to organize your tests.

### a. Directory Structure

Adopt a directory layout that mirrors your production source code structure. This allows developers to easily locate tests for corresponding components.

Example:

```
project_root/
├── src/                # Production code
│   ├── moduleA/
│   ├── moduleB/
│   └── ...
└── tests/              # Test code
    ├── moduleA/
    │   ├── moduleA_test.cc
    │   └── helper_test.cc
    ├── moduleB/
    │   └── moduleB_test.cc
    └── ...
```

### b. Naming Conventions

Follow consistent and descriptive naming conventions for your test files and test suites.

- Filename suffix: Use `_test.cc` or `_unittest.cc` to denote test files.
- Test suite names: Use the class or module name being tested appended with `Test` (e.g., `FooTest`).
- Test names: Use descriptive names without underscores, focusing on behavior or scenario (avoid underscores per GoogleTest naming recommendations to prevent macro-related issues).

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, HandlesEmptyInput) {
  ...
}
```

### c. Group Related Tests Using Fixtures

Use `TEST_F()` and test fixtures to share common setup and teardown, organizing logically related tests within the same suite.

### d. Splitting Large Test Suites

Avoid monolithic test files or test suites. Split large suites into smaller ones by feature, functionality, or component to improve test execution and clarity.

<Tip>
Use `DISABLED_` prefix on test or test suite names cautiously to temporarily exclude failing or incomplete tests.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Managing and Scaling Test Suites

As projects grow, effective test organization becomes crucial for maintainability and performance.

### Strategies:

- **Modular Test Binaries:** Create multiple test executables scoped by components or layers to reduce execution time and simplify debugging.

- **Test Filtering:** Use `--gtest_filter` to run targeted subsets during development.

- **Test Sharding:** Distribute tests across machines or parallel jobs using `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` environment variables.

- **Parameterized Testing:** Use value-parameterized and typed tests (`TEST_P`, `TYPED_TEST`) to reduce duplication and cover multiple scenarios succinctly.

- **Shared Fixtures:** Use test fixtures with shared resources cautiously to avoid flaky tests and ensure isolation.

## 4. Recommended Directory and Naming Conventions

| Entity               | Naming Style                  | Description and Example                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Test file            | `<module>_test.cc`           | `queue_test.cc` for testing the `queue` module      |
| Test suite           | `<ClassOrModuleName>Test`     | `QueueTest` for tests related to `Queue` class      |
| Test case / test name| Descriptive, no underscores  | `HandlesEmptyQueue`, `EnqueuesItemsSuccessfully`    |

**Notes:** Names excluding underscores is critical for macro expansions and future compatibility.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Tests Not Discovered:** Check that test files are compiled and linked into your test executable. Verify no typo in `TEST()` macros.

- **Underscores in Test Names:** Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent macro conflicts.

- **Monolithic Test Files:** Avoid combining too many unrelated tests in one file to reduce complexity and build times.

- **Ignoring Test Fixture Instantiation:** Remember GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance per test; avoid relying on shared mutable state in fixtures.

- **Slow Test Startup:** Large test binaries with many tests may slow startup; split tests logically.

## 6. Examples

### Example Directory Layout

```
project/
├── src/
│   └── math_utils.cpp
└── tests/
    ├── math_utils_test.cc
    └── string_utils_test.cc
```

### Example Test File (`math_utils_test.cc`)

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "../src/math_utils.h"

// Test suite named MathUtilsTest, matching the source module.
TEST(MathUtilsTest, ComputesFactorialCorrectly) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}

TEST(MathUtilsTest, HandlesNegativeInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(-1), 0);  // Example behavior
}
```

## 7. Verification and Troubleshooting

### Confirming Test Discovery

- Run your test executable with:
  ```shell
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
  ```
  This lists all detected tests.

- If no tests appear:
  - Verify tests are compiled and linked correctly.
  - Confirm they use GoogleTest macros correctly (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc).

### Filtering and Running Specific Tests

- Use `--gtest_filter` to run tests selectively:
  ```shell
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MathUtilsTest.*
  ```

### Common Build or Link Issues

- Missing tests can result from build misconfigurations; consult the [Common Build or Linking Errors FAQ](/faq/troubleshooting-integration/common-build-errors).

### Best Practices

- Keep test binaries lightweight and logically grouped.
- Use parameterized tests to reduce bloated code.
- Write test names that clearly express intent.

<Tip>
Remember to avoid using underscores in test suite and test names, as explained in the FAQ, to prevent unexpected macro issues.
</Tip>
