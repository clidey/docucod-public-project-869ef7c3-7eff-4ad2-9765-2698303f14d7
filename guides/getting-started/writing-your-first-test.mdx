# Writing Your First Test

Welcome to your hands-on guide for writing your first unit test using GoogleTest! This walkthrough introduces the essential workflow to define a test, apply basic assertions, run your test suite, and immediately see feedback about correctness.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
You will learn how to:
- Define a simple test case using GoogleTest's testing macros
- Write assertions that verify your code’s correctness
- Compile and run your test executable
- Interpret test output and results for successes and failures

### Prerequisites
- A C++ development environment with a C++17 compliant compiler
- GoogleTest installed and accessible in your project (header files and libraries)
- Basic knowledge of C++ syntax

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will have:
- Written a minimal test using `TEST()` macro
- Used assertions like `EXPECT_EQ` to check values
- Built and run your test executable, observing test results output

### Time Estimate
This guide requires approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the exercises.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner: no prior experience with GoogleTest required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Test File">
Write a new C++ source file, for example `my_first_test.cc`. Include the GoogleTest header:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

This header brings in the testing framework’s macros and functions.
</Step>

<Step title="Define a Simple Test Case">
Use the `TEST()` macro to define a test case with a name and a test:

```cpp
TEST(ExampleTest, SimpleEquality) {
  int a = 5;
  int b = 5;
  EXPECT_EQ(a, b);  // Verifies a equals b
}
```

- The first parameter `ExampleTest` is the test suite name.
- The second parameter `SimpleEquality` is the test name.

This defines one test that checks if variables `a` and `b` are equal.
</Step>

<Step title="Write Basic Assertions">
Inside the test block, add assertions to verify your conditions. Common assertions include:

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`: checks equality
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`: expects condition to be true
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`: expect inequality

Example:

```cpp
TEST(SimpleMathTest, Addition) {
  int result = 2 + 2;
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 4);
}
```

Assertions will report failures but allow other tests to proceed.
</Step>

<Step title="Compile Your Test Program">
Compile your test file along with the GoogleTest libraries.

Example with g++:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread \
    my_first_test.cc /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a -o my_first_test
```

Make sure to adjust your include and library paths accordingly.
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Tests">
Execute the compiled test binary:

```bash
./my_first_test
```

You will see output listing the tests run and their results.

Example output:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from ExampleTest
[ RUN      ] ExampleTest.SimpleEquality
[       OK ] ExampleTest.SimpleEquality (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] ExampleTest.OtherTest
[       OK ] ExampleTest.OtherTest (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from ExampleTest (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```
</Step>

<Step title="Interpret Test Results">

- `PASSED` tests mean their assertions all succeeded.
- If any assertion fails, you will see detailed messages explaining the failure (including file, line, expected vs actual).

Example failure message:

```
my_first_test.cc:10: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  a
    Which is: 5
  b
    Which is: 3
```

This immediate feedback helps identify bugs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

### Minimal Test Example

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(BasicTest, IntegerEquality) {
  int expected = 42;
  int actual = 40 + 2;
  EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
}
```

### Using Multiple Assertions

```cpp
TEST(StringTest, BasicAssertions) {
  std::string hello = "Hello";
  EXPECT_FALSE(hello.empty());
  EXPECT_EQ(hello.size(), 5);
  EXPECT_NE(hello, "World");
}
```

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always **name your tests clearly** to describe what behavior they verify.
- Write tests that are **isolated** and do not depend on each other.
- Use **`EXPECT_`** assertions to continue the test after failure and **`ASSERT_`** assertions to abort a test if a condition fails.
- **Compile and run frequently** during development to catch mistakes early.
- For complex verifications, consider **parameterized** or **typed** tests (covered in later guides).
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to view all registered tests.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue: Test Not Running

- Ensure your test binary links correctly with GoogleTest libraries (`libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a`).
- Check that you call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` if you provide your own `main()`.

### Assertion Failures

- Read messages carefully. They show which file and line failed, what values were expected and actual.
- For unexpected results, inspect code logic or check calculation correctness.

### Linking Errors

- Confirm include paths (`-isystem`) and library paths (`-L`) are correctly set.
- Make sure you compile with `-pthread` on Linux.

If issues persist, consult the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/common-issues-troubleshooting) or [Configuring GoogleTest](../../getting-started/configuration-troubleshooting/configuration-basics).
