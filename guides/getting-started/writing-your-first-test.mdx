# Writing Your First Test

## Overview

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with GoogleTest! This guide takes you step-by-step through creating your first basic test using GoogleTest, enabling you to quickly validate your code behavior and gain confidence in your testing process.

You will learn how to:

- Set up a test environment with GoogleTest
- Write simple test cases
- Use assertions to check expected outcomes
- Compile and run your tests

By the end of this guide, you will have a working C++ test that exercises your code with automated validation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin writing your first test, ensure you have the following in place:

- GoogleTest installed and available in your project (refer to the [Installation Guide](../../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/installing-on-linux-macos-windows.md)).
- Basic C++ development environment with a compiler supporting C++17 or later (see [Prerequisites & System Requirements](../../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements.md)).
- Your project's build system configured to link against GoogleTest (see [Configuring Projects with GoogleTest](../../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/configuring-projects-with-googletest.md)).

If you have not completed these steps, please review the related setup documentation before continuing.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Include the GoogleTest Headers

Start by including the main GoogleTest header in your test source file:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
```

This header provides all necessary declarations to write tests and assertions.

### 2. Write Your First Test

Use the `TEST` macro to define a test function. It takes two arguments: a test suite name and a test name. Inside the function, write assertions to verify code behavior.

For example, testing a simple function `Factorial`:

```cpp
// Function to test
int Factorial(int n) {
  return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

// Test case
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(8), 40320);
}
```

This creates two tests within the `FactorialTest` suite, each asserting the correctness of `Factorial` on different inputs.

### 3. Compile Your Test

Ensure your test file is compiled and linked with GoogleTest and your production code. For projects using CMake, a typical minimal CMake snippet might be:

```cmake
add_executable(my_test test_factorial.cc factorial.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest gtest_main pthread)
```

Replace `test_factorial.cc` and `factorial.cc` with your file names.

### 4. Run the Test Suite

Execute your test binary. GoogleTest will automatically discover and run every test defined by `TEST()` and report results:

```shell
./my_test
```

Sample output:

```
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

### 5. Interpret Test Results

Each test prints whether it passed or failed. On failure, GoogleTest outputs detailed failure messages including file location and mismatched values.

You can run individual tests or use filters (see related guides).

## Best Practices & Tips

- Name your test suites and test cases clearly to convey intent, using CamelCase and avoiding underscores.
- Use `EXPECT_` assertions for non-fatal failures to allow multiple verifications within the same test.
- Choose `ASSERT_` assertions for conditions that must hold to continue testing meaningfully.
- Keep tests focused — test one logical feature or behavior per test.
- Write tests that are deterministic and independent.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Test executable doesn’t run or find tests:** Ensure you linked against `gtest` and called `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` in your `main()` function if you have a custom main.

- **Tests report as skipped or zero run:** Confirm your test functions use the `TEST()` macro and that they have valid suite and test names.

- **Compiler errors related to `MOCK_METHOD` usage:** Ensure you include `<gmock/gmock.h>` and properly configure your build system for GoogleMock if mocking is involved.

- **Linker errors:** Verify linkage with `gtest_main` or provide a main function that calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

See [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-faq-support/common-setup-errors.md) for more details.

## Example: Minimal Complete Test

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

TEST(AdditionTest, SimpleAddition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 1), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(-3, 3), 0);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and run to see your first automated test validating function correctness.
