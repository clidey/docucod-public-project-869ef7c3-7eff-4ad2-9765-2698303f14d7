# Running Tests & Interpreting Results

## Overview

This guide will help you successfully execute your tests using GoogleTest, understand and interpret command-line options, analyze test output, and make sense of test summary reports. By mastering these skills, you will efficiently monitor your test success and quickly diagnose failures, improving your development and testing workflow.

---

## 1. Running your Test Executable

GoogleTest tests are compiled into an executable. Running this executable will automatically execute all tests registered with GoogleTest in your binary.

### Prerequisites
- Your tests must be compiled and linked properly, with GoogleTest libraries included.
- Optionally, GoogleMock can be linked in when mock support is required.
- Your test executable should be built via your build system or manually.

### Basic Execution
- Run the test executable from a command prompt or terminal.
- By default, all tests will run, and output will be displayed to the console.

```bash
./your_test_executable
```

### Expected Outcome
- Each test suite and test will be executed in sequence.
- Output indicating test start, pass/fail status, and any failure messages will appear.
- A final summary of all tests run, passed, or failed is printed.

### Time Estimate
This depends on the number of tests. Small test suites typically run instantaneously; larger test suites might take several seconds or minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

## 2. Understanding Command-Line Flags

GoogleTest supports a variety of command-line flags that allow you to customize test execution and reporting.

### Commonly Used Flags
| Flag | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--gtest_filter=` | Run only tests that match the pattern. | `--gtest_filter=MySuite.*` runs all tests in MySuite |
| `--gtest_repeat=` | Repeat tests multiple times. | `--gtest_repeat=10` runs all tests 10 times |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure` | Trigger debugger breakpoint on failure |
| `--gtest_output=` | Output test results in XML or JSON format. | `--gtest_output=xml:report.xml` |
| `--gtest_shuffle` | Run tests in random order |
| `--gmock_verbose=` | Control verbosity of GoogleMock output (`info`, `warning`, `error`)

### How to Use Flags
Flags should be passed as arguments when running your test executable.

Example:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.* --gtest_repeat=3
```

### Verifying Flags
Invalid flags or unsupported values will cause the test executable to print an error and exit.

---

## 3. Understanding Test Output

GoogleTest produces detailed output during test execution. Understanding this output helps you know which tests passed, which failed, and why.

### Typical Output Format

```text
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
/path/to/test.cc:45: Failure
Expected equality of these values:
  Factorial(2)
    Which is: 3
  2
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test suite ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

### Key Sections
- `[ RUN      ]` - indicates a test started running
- `[       OK ]` - test passed
- `[  FAILED  ]` - test failed, with optional failure details
- Test suite summary and overall run summary

### Diagnosing Failures
- Failure message includes file and line number
- Expected vs actual values are shown
- Multiple failures in a test are reported individually

### Best Practices
- Use the output to quickly locate failed tests and the exact assertions that failed
- Use line numbers in failure output to jump directly to problematic code
- Be aware that GoogleTest continues running other tests even after failures

---

## 4. Interpreting the Test Summary Report

At the end of a test run, GoogleTest prints a summary indicating total tests run and their outcomes.

### Elements of the Summary
| Element | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[==========]` | Total tests run and total time
| `[  PASSED  ]` | Number of tests passed
| `[  FAILED  ]` | Number of tests failed and list of failed tests

### Example
```text
[==========] 100 tests from 10 test suites ran. (20 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 98 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 2 tests, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] MySuite.TestCase1
[  FAILED  ] OtherSuite.TestCaseA

 2 FAILED TESTS
```

### How to Act on the Summary
- Focus on `[  FAILED  ]` list to investigate problems
- Use `--gtest_filter` to re-run only failing tests
- Adjust tests or code based on diagnostic failure output

## 5. Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Always set expectations before running test code involving mocks.**
- **Use `--gtest_filter` to isolate and repeatedly run failing tests for efficient debugging.**
- **Be cautious of flaky tests caused by shared global state; tests should be independent.**
- **Enable `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed mock call tracing when debugging mocks.**
- **Remember that GoogleTest continues running all tests by default even if some tests failâ€”use `--gtest_break_on_failure` for breakpoint debugging.**
- **Leverage output XML/JSON reports for integration with CI systems and test dashboards.**

---

## 6. Example: Running and Filtering Tests

Suppose you have the following tests:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) { EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1); }
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) { EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2); }
TEST(StringTest, ReturnsEmptyString) { EXPECT_EQ(GetString(), ""); }
```

Run only the factorial tests:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.*
```

Repeat the factorial tests 5 times (for flaky test detection):

```bash
./your_test_executable --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.* --gtest_repeat=5
```

Enable verbose mock output:

```bash
./your_test_executable --gmock_verbose=info
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test executable runs but no tests executed | Tests are not linked or registered properly | Ensure source/test files are included in build; use `TEST()` macros correctly |
| Unexpected test failures without clear reasons | Mocks called without expectation; insufficient `EXPECT_CALL`s | Set expectations before exercising mocks; use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings |
| Tests run slowly or hang | Deadlocks in tests, repeated retries without limits | Use `--gtest_break_on_failure`, log with `--gmock_verbose=info`; optimize tests |
| Difficulty finding failure points | Large output; hard to identify failed tests | Use `--gtest_filter` to isolate failures; use IDE integration for navigating failures |

<Tip>
Run the test executable with `--gtest_help` to see all available command-line flags.
