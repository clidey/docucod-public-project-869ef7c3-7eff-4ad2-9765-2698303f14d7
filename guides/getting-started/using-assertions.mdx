### Using Assertions Effectively

#### Workflow Overview

- **Task Description:**
  This guide helps you master the variety of assertions provided by GoogleTest to write clear, precise, and robust tests. You'll learn when and how to use fatal (ASSERT_) versus non-fatal (EXPECT_) checks, test for exceptions and error conditions, and design expressive assertions that generate informative diagnostics.

- **Prerequisites:**
  - GoogleTest installed and configured (see Installation Guide).
  - Basic knowledge of writing and running simple tests (refer to Writing Your First Test).
  - Familiarity with C++ test case structure.

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Confident use of the full suite of GoogleTest assertion macros.
  - Ability to choose appropriate assertion types based on test intention.
  - Skills to write assertions that provide clear diagnostic messages for quick debugging.

- **Time Estimate:** 20-30 minutes to read and practice.

- **Difficulty Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

##### 1. Choose Between Fatal and Non-Fatal Assertions

- Understand that `ASSERT_` macros generate fatal failures stopping the current test function, whereas `EXPECT_` macros generate nonfatal failures allowing the test to continue.
- Use **`ASSERT_`** when further execution without the condition being true will cause crashes or meaningless results.
- Use **`EXPECT_`** where it is useful to continue verifying multiple related conditions in one test.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MyTest, CheckPointer) {
  int* ptr = GetPointer();
  ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer must not be null";
  // Safe to dereference ptr after ASSERT_NE
  EXPECT_EQ(*ptr, 42) << "Pointer value was unexpected";
}
```

##### 2. Use Explicit Success and Failure Assertions

- Use `SUCCEED()` for indicating explicit test successes in complex control flows.
- Use `FAIL()` to trigger a fatal failure when an unexpected branch is taken.
- Use `ADD_FAILURE()` for non-fatal, unconditional failures without aborting the current function.

**Example:**
```cpp
if (unexpected_condition) {
  FAIL() << "Unexpected error encountered.";
}
```

##### 3. Apply Boolean Condition Assertions

- Use `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` or `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` to verify positive conditions.
- Use `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` or `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` for negative conditions.

##### 4. Perform Binary Comparisons

- Use `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` and `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` to test equality.
- Use related macros for inequality: `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE`.
- Remember, for pointers, `EXPECT_EQ` checks addresses. For C strings (e.g., char*), use `EXPECT_STREQ` instead.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected);
EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2);
```

##### 5. Use String Comparison Assertions

- Use `EXPECT_STREQ` and `EXPECT_STRNE` for comparing C-style strings (including wide strings).
- Use case-insensitive variants: `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ` and `EXPECT_STRCASENE`.

##### 6. Handle Floating-Point Comparisons Correctly

- Avoid `EXPECT_EQ` for floats due to rounding issues.
- Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` for approximate equality within 4 ULPs.
- Use `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` for custom absolute error bounds.

##### 7. Test for Exceptions

- Use `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` to verify that given code throws.
- Use `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` to verify any exception is thrown.
- Use `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` to verify no exceptions are thrown.

##### 8. Use Predicate Assertions for Complex Checks

- Use `EXPECT_PRED*` macros to verify predicates with multiple arguments.
- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` for predicates that generate detailed failure messages.

**Example:**
```cpp
bool IsPositive(int n) { return n > 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, value);
```

##### 9. Apply Windows HRESULT Assertions (if applicable)

- Use `EXPECT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(expression)` to verify success HRESULTs.
- Use `EXPECT_HRESULT_FAILED(expression)` to verify failure HRESULTs.

##### 10. Use Death Assertions for Testing Termination Paths

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, matcher)` to verify code causes termination with expected error pattern.
- Use variants like `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED`, `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH`, and `EXPECT_EXIT` for specialized death tests.

---

#### Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always stream custom failure messages using `<<` operator to clarify diagnostics.
- Prefer non-fatal `EXPECT_` assertions if the test can meaningfully continue after failure.
- Use fatal `ASSERT_` assertions when continuing would cause undefined behavior.
- Use matchers in assertions (`EXPECT_THAT`) to enhance expressiveness.
- Verify floating-point assertions use appropriate tolerances to avoid flaky tests.
- Write clear, descriptive messages in assertions to ease debugging.

#### Common Pitfalls

- Using `EXPECT_EQ` for C strings compares pointers, not string content.
- Misusing `ASSERT_` macros outside functions returning void causes compilation errors.
- Ignoring exception testing when code expected to handle or throw exceptions.
- Using exact equality for floating-point values can cause fragile tests.

#### Verification Steps

- Run your tests and confirm failure messages are clear and point to exact assertion failures.
- Check if exception tests actually catch the expected exceptions.
- Validate that death tests correctly fail when code does not terminate as expected.

#### Examples & Real-World Scenarios

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}

TEST(StringTest, CaseInsensitiveCompare) {
  const char* s1 = "Hello";
  const char* s2 = "hello";
  EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(s1, s2);
}

TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_THROW(Compute(-1), std::invalid_argument);
}

TEST(DeathTest, TerminatesOnAssertionFailure) {
  EXPECT_DEATH({ assert(false); }, "Assertion.*failed");
}

TEST(FloatingPointTest, ApproxEqual) {
  EXPECT_NEAR(ComputeValue(), 3.1415, 0.001);
}
```

#### Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Problem:** Fatal assertion (`ASSERT_`) unexpectedly aborts the test function.
  - **Solution:** Verify if failure genuinely invalidates further test logic or consider switching to non-fatal `EXPECT_` assertions if test should continue.

- **Problem:** Floating-point equality test fails due to tiny rounding errors.
  - **Solution:** Use `EXPECT_NEAR` or `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` instead of `EXPECT_EQ`.

- **Problem:** Tests unexpectedly pass/fail with exceptions.
  - **Solution:** Confirm exception assertions (`EXPECT_THROW` / `EXPECT_NO_THROW`) are correctly set up and that exceptions are enabled in your build.

- **Problem:** Confusing error messages from assertions.
  - **Solution:** Add custom messages with streaming `<<` to clarify.

- **Tip:** Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for expressive assertions and better diagnostics.

- **Tip:** Combine multiple related assertions using `EXPECT_` to get complete failure information in one run.

<Info>
Use `ASSERT_` macros to stop test execution on critical failures and `EXPECT_` to report failures but continue testing. Stream custom messages to assertions for clarity.
</Info>

<Warning>
Avoid using exact equality (`EXPECT_EQ`) for floating-point comparisons; use floating-point specific macros to avoid flaky tests.
</Warning>
