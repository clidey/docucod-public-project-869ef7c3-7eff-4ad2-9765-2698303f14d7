# Assertions and Test Patterns

GoogleTest offers a rich collection of assertions that allow you to validate conditions in your tests and report failures meaningfully. This guide helps you understand the available types of assertions, how to choose between fatal and non-fatal failures, structure your assertions for better clarity, and practical advice for diagnosing test failures effectively.

## 1. Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

GoogleTest assertions serve as checkpoints in your tests to verify that your code behaves as expected. When an assertion fails, it indicates a test failure, which can stop test execution or allow it to continue based on the assertion type.

### Types of Assertions

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: These immediately abort the current test function upon failure. Use fatal assertions when continuing the test after failure makes no sense (e.g., critical setup checks).

- **Non-Fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: These report failures but allow the current test function to continue running. Use non-fatal assertions to collect multiple failure points in a single test run.

### Choosing Between Fatal and Non-Fatal

- Use **fatal assertions** when a failure means the rest of the test cannot be meaningfully run (e.g., failed initialization).
- Use **non-fatal assertions** to detect multiple issues in one test execution for more comprehensive failure reporting.

<Tip>
When in doubt, prefer non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) during normal test logic, and use fatal assertions only when a failure prevents safe continuation.
</Tip>

## 2. Common Assertion Macros and Their Usage

### Basic Assertions

| Macro           | Description                                        | Example                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` | Fails if condition is false, stops test execution | `ASSERT_TRUE(is_valid);`        |
| `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` | Fails if condition is false, continues execution  | `EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid);`        |
| `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)`| Fails if condition is true, stops test execution  | `ASSERT_FALSE(has_error);`      |
| `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)`| Fails if condition is true, continues execution   | `EXPECT_FALSE(has_error);`      |

### Equality and Comparison Assertions

| Macro                  | Description                                      | Example                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)`     | Aborts test if `val1 != val2`                   | `ASSERT_EQ(count, 5);`         |
| `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`     | Records failure if `val1 != val2`, continues    | `EXPECT_EQ(result, expected);` |
| `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)`     | Aborts test if `val1 == val2`                   | `ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr);`     |
| `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`     | Records failure if `val1 == val2`, continues    | `EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr);`     |
| `ASSERT_LT(val1, val2)`     | Aborts test if `val1 >= val2`                   | `ASSERT_LT(size, max_size);`   |
| `EXPECT_LT(val1, val2)`     | Records failure if `val1 >= val2`, continues    | `EXPECT_LT(size, max_size);`   |

*(Similarly: `ASSERT_LE`, `ASSERT_GT`, `ASSERT_GE`, and their `EXPECT_` variants)*

### String Assertions

| Macro | Description                   | Example                                   |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)` | Aborts if C strings differ            | `ASSERT_STREQ(name.c_str(), "foo");`       |
| `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` | Continues if C strings differ         | `EXPECT_STREQ(name.c_str(), "foo");`       |
| `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)` | Aborts if C strings are equal         | `ASSERT_STRNE(name.c_str(), "bar");`       |
| `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` | Continues if C strings are equal      | `EXPECT_STRNE(name.c_str(), "bar");`       |

## 3. Structuring Assertions for Clarity and Diagnostics

### Best Practices

- **Keep assertions simple and focused:** One assertion per logical check improves clarity and failure diagnostics.
- **Use descriptive messages:** GoogleTest supports adding messages to assertions by streaming text after the macro call; this helps explain why a failure occurred.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value, expected) << "Value differed in function X at step Y";
```

- **Separate checks that guard follow-up code:** Use fatal assertions for prerequisites without which subsequent code is invalid.

- **Use EXPECT_CALL and mocks for interaction verification:** To verify calls on mocks properly, which complements value assertions.

### Avoid Over-Specification

- Focus on verifying impactful properties. Excessively detailed assertions may cause brittle tests.

- Leverage matchers (`_, Ge()`, `Lt()`, etc.) to allow some flexibility in expected values.

<Tip>
If you find yourself repeating similar assertions, consider creating utility functions or custom matchers for cleaner code.
</Tip>

## 4. Diagnosing Assertion Failures Effectively

When a test fails due to an assertion, understanding the message is key to quick diagnosis.

### What to Look For

- **Failure location:** GoogleTest reports the file name and line number of the failed assertion.

- **Expected vs Actual:** Most equality or comparison assertions print both values, assisting in spotting the discrepancy.

- **Custom messages:** Read any user-provided assertion failure messages for context.

- **Stack trace and context:** Enable verbose output or debugging mode to get stack traces that point to the failure origin.

### Using Verbose Mode

Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed logs about matching expectations and mock calls. This can help identify which expectation was matched or why a call failed.

### Common Failure Patterns

- **Unexpected call:** A mock method was called with arguments not matching any expectation.

- **Too few/many calls:** A method was called fewer or more times than specified.

- **Argument mismatch:** Calls matched expectations by name but argument values did not satisfy argument matchers.

- **Sequence/order violation:** Calls occurred out of the expected order.

<Tip>
When debugging complex mock-based tests, adding more specific `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times()` and `InSequence()` clauses combined with verbose logging will significantly speed up diagnosing failures.
</Tip>

## 5. Examples

### Example 1: Using Fatal and Non-Fatal Assertions

```cpp
TEST(MyComponentTest, ValidatesProcessing) {
  MyComponent c;

  // Abort test if fundamental condition fails.
  ASSERT_TRUE(c.IsInitialized()) << "Component failed to initialize";

  int result = c.ProcessData(42);

  // Continue the test to report multiple failures if present.
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 100) << "ProcessData returned unexpected value";
  EXPECT_GT(c.GetCount(), 0) << "Count should be positive after processing";
}
```

### Example 2: Reporting Multiple Failures with Non-Fatal Assertions

```cpp
TEST(ArrayTest, ElementsWithinRange) {
  std::vector<int> values = GetValues();

  for (int v : values) {
    EXPECT_GE(v, 0) << "Value " << v << " is negative";
    EXPECT_LT(v, 100) << "Value " << v << " exceeds maximum";
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Diagnosing Unexpected Mock Call

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockFoo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n), ());
};

TEST(MockFooTest, HandlesCalls) {
  MockFoo mock;

  ON_CALL(mock, Bar(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5));

  int val = mock.Bar(4);  // Warning: uninteresting call (no expectation for argument 4)
  val = mock.Bar(5);      // Expected call.
}
```

Running with `--gmock_verbose=info` will show that the call with argument 4 did not match any expectation and took the default action.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Test continues despite critical failures:** Review if you mistakenly used `EXPECT_*` instead of `ASSERT_*` for conditions that should abort.

- **Unexpected call errors:** Verify your `EXPECT_CALL`s are correctly set up before exercising the code and match the intended arguments.

- **Flaky tests due to overly strict expectations:** Consider relaxing matchers or using sequences carefully.

- **Ambiguous overload resolution:** For overloaded mock methods, specify the exact signature or use `Const()` wrapper to disambiguate const vs non-const overloads.

### Best Practices

- Use `ASSERT_*` for conditions that *must* be true to continue testing.
- Use `EXPECT_*` to collect multiple failures for comprehensive diagnostics.
- Use matchers (`_`, `Ge()`, `Ne()`, etc.) for flexible argument matching.
- Add clear custom messages to assertions where failure context is not obvious.
- When mocking, set expectations early and keep the test focused on one behavior per test case.

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid heavy computations or side effects inside assertions.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly, set `Times(AnyNumber())` if not interested in call count to reduce overhead.

### Alternative Approaches

If you want to verify values more subtly, use `EXPECT_THAT()` combined with GoogleMock matchers for expressive validation:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, Ge(10));
EXPECT_THAT(container, ElementsAre(1, _, 3));
```

This enriches assertion flexibility beyond simple equality.
