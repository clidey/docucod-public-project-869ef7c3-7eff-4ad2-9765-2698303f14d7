# Leveraging Assertions and Matchers Effectively

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a powerful, expressive set of **assertions** and **matchers** to verify your C++ code behavior and interactions during testing. This guide will help you harness these features to craft clear, resilient, and maintainable tests by using practical patterns for checking outputs, errors, and mock interactions.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions and Matchers

### What Are Assertions?
Assertions are statements that verify expected program states or return values. If an assertion fails, the test records a failure. GoogleTest supports *nonfatal* (`EXPECT_`) and *fatal* (`ASSERT_`) assertion variants.

### What Are Matchers?
Matchers define the criteria for expected values or arguments. They enable rich, readable checks on values and mock method calls. For example, instead of writing verbose comparison code, you write:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(actual_value, Ge(10));  // Verifies actual_value >= 10
```

Matchers can be combined and nested to form expressive conditions.

---

## 2. Basic Assertion Usage

### Using `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*`

- Use `EXPECT_*` for checks that allow test continuation on failure.
- Use `ASSERT_*` for critical checks that must abort the current test stage on failure.

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, 42) << "Result did not match expected 42";
ASSERT_TRUE(is_valid) << "State is invalid, aborting test";
```

### Common Binary Assertions

| Assertion       | Description              |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `EXPECT_EQ(a,b)`| Checks `a == b`          |
| `EXPECT_NE(a,b)`| Checks `a != b`          |
| `EXPECT_LT(a,b)`| Checks `a < b`           |
| `EXPECT_LE(a,b)`| Checks `a <= b`          |
| `EXPECT_GT(a,b)`| Checks `a > b`           |
| `EXPECT_GE(a,b)`| Checks `a >= b`          |

### Boolean Assertions

| Assertion          | Description            |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `EXPECT_TRUE(cond)` | Checks `cond == true`   |
| `EXPECT_FALSE(cond)`| Checks `cond == false`  |

## 3. Using `EXPECT_THAT` with Matchers for Expressive Tests

`EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` allows flexible, readable verification using **matchers**.

### Wildcard Matchers
- `_` matches any value.

### Value Matchers
- `Eq(value)` matches if argument equals `value`.
- `Ne(value)` matches if not equal.
- `Ge(value)`, `Gt(value)`, `Le(value)`, `Lt(value)` allow range comparisons.

### Composite Matchers
- `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)` matches if *all* matchers are satisfied.
- `AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)` matches if *any* matcher is satisfied.
- `Not(m)` matches if matcher `m` does *not* match.

### String Matchers
- `StartsWith(prefix)`, `EndsWith(suffix)`, `HasSubstr(substring)`
- `StrEq(s)`, `StrNe(s)`, ignoring case variants available

### Container Matchers
- `ElementsAre(...)` verifies container elements by position.
- `UnorderedElementsAre(...)` verifies container elements ignoring order.
- `Contains(element)` verifies at least one element matches.
- `Each(m)` verifies every element matches matcher `m`.

### Pointer Matchers
- `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`
- `Pointee(m)` matches pointer pointing to value satisfying `m`.

### Member and Property Matchers

- `Field(&Class::field, matcher)` matches if object's field satisfies matcher.
- `Property(&Class::method, matcher)` matches if object's property method returns a value satisfying matcher.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(actual_vector, ElementsAre(Gt(0), _, Le(10)));
EXPECT_THAT(foo_pointer, Pointee(Field(&Foo::bar, Eq(42))));
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
```

---

## 4. Matching Mock Method Arguments

Matchers are essential when setting expectations on mock objects. Use them in `EXPECT_CALL` to describe expected argument conditions:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(Ge(10), StartsWith("hello")));
```

If you want to allow any argument, use `_`.

### Best Practices
- **Specify only essential matchers**: Avoid over-specification for flexible, resilient tests.
- **Use composite matchers** (`AllOf`, `AnyOf`) for complex conditions.
- **Order matters**: More specific expectations should be declared **after** more general ones to take precedence.

### Multi-argument Matching
Use `.With(multi_arg_matcher)` to apply a matcher on all arguments as a tuple. Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetXY(_, _)).With(Lt()); // first arg < second arg
```

---

## 5. Advanced Matcher Techniques

### Using `SafeMatcherCast` to Match Compatible Types
If matcher and argument types differ but are compatible, you can use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` to safely adapt matchers across types.

### Parameterized Matchers
Define matchers that take parameters using `MATCHER_P` and friends:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleBy, divisor, "") {
  return (arg % divisor) == 0;
}
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsDivisibleBy(5)));
```

### Composing Matchers
Matchers can be combined deeply to create expressive conditions:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Ge(0), Le(100), Not(Eq(50))));
```

### Writing Custom Matchers
Use `MATCHER` macros or implement a matcher interface to define your own domain-specific matchers for encapsulating complex logic.

---

## 6. Using Assertions with Matchers

`EXPECT_THAT` and `ASSERT_THAT` integrate matchers directly in assertions:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(result, Eq(expected));
ASSERT_THAT(vector, ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

They provide detailed failure messages showing why the match failed, greatly improving test diagnostics.

---

## 7. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

### Over-specification Leads to Brittle Tests
Match only what's necessary. For example, if only the first argument matters, do:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(42, _));
```

rather than specifying all arguments precisely.

### Expectation Ordering
Expectations are evaluated in reverse declaration order. Put more specific expectations *after* generic ones.

### Uninteresting Calls
By default, calls to mock methods without expectations generate warnings but do not fail the test. To suppress warnings, use `NiceMock`. To treat them as errors, use `StrictMock`.

### Combining Actions
Use `DoAll()` to run multiple actions for a single mock call.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo())
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<0>(42), Return(true)));
```

### Returning References
Use `ReturnRef()` to return references from mock methods instead of values.

### Verifying Calls
The framework automatically verifies expectations at mock destruction.
You can also force verification via `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)`.

---

## 8. Examples

### Basic Argument Matching and Action

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::Ge;
using ::testing::_;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue(Ge(10)))
    .WillOnce(Return(42));

EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetValue(_, _)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### Custom Matcher

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(IsEven()));
EXPECT_THAT(some_value, IsEven());
```

### Using Composite Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Ge(0), Le(100), Not(Eq(50))));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(AllOf(Ge(10), Le(20))));
```

### Matching Container Content

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(vec, ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
EXPECT_THAT(set, UnorderedElementsAre(3, 2, 1));
```

### Matching Pointer Dereferenced Values

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Pointee(Eq(42))));
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Mismatch in expectations**: Check argument matchers for strictness.
- **Uninteresting call warnings**: Verify if your test should set expectations or consider using `NiceMock`.
- **Overloaded functions ambiguity**: Use `TypedEq<T>()` or other disambiguation techniques.
- **Reference return types**: Use `ReturnRef()` action.

### Best Practices
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors without strict expectations.
- Set explicit `EXPECT_CALL` only for interactions you want to verify.
- Group ordered expectations with `InSequence` to avoid ordering errors.
- Reduce matcher complexity to keep tests readable and maintainable.
