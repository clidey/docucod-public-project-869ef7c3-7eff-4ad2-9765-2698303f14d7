# Scaling Test Suites and Optimizing Performance

## Overview

As your GoogleTest suite grows to cover more code and scenarios, maintaining rapid feedback and manageable test infrastructure requires deliberate strategies. This guide focuses specifically on tactics *within* GoogleTest to enhance performance and scalability of your test suites. You will learn how to leverage **parallelization**, **selective test execution**, **efficient test discovery**, and **focused test writing** techniques to keep your test runs fast and actionable on enterprise-scale C++ projects.

## 1. Enhancing Test Suite Speed

### 1.1 Run Tests in Parallel

GoogleTest supports **test sharding** to distribute the execution of tests across multiple machines or cores, thus accelerating overall test completion.

**How it works:**

- Set the environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` to the number of shards (machines/cores) and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to the index of the current shard (0-based).
- Each shard runs the same test binary.
- GoogleTest uses these values to select a unique subset of tests per shard, ensuring full coverage without overlap.

**Example:** To split tests evenly over 4 cores:

```bash
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
# On core 0
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./my_test_binary

# On core 1
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./my_test_binary

# Repeat for indexes 2 and 3
```

**Best practices:**

- Ensure tests are **independent** and do not share state that causes inter-test conflicts.
- If tests are not perfectly balanced in runtime, you may need to partition manually or use custom test filters to balance shard workloads.

### 1.2 Use Test Filtering

GoogleTest provides **test filtering** to run only a subset of tests matching specified patterns. This reduces test runtime dramatically during development and debugging.

- Use the `--gtest_filter` flag or the `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable.
- Patterns support wildcards `*` (any sequence) and `?` (single character), and can include negative filters prefixed by `-`.

**Example:**

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.*  # Run all tests in 'MySuite'
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=*Null*:BarTest.*-MySuite.Bar  # Include tests with 'Null' or any in 'BarTest' except 'MySuite.Bar'
```

**Tip:** Combine filtering with parallelization to shard only the relevant tests.

### 1.3 Repeat and Shuffle Tests

To catch flaky tests and improve reliability:

- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times.
- Combine with `--gtest_shuffle` and `--gtest_random_seed` for random execution order.

Repeated and shuffled tests expose hidden dependencies and improve confidence.

## 2. Test Suite Organization for Performance

### 2.1 Share Setup and TearDown Resources

Avoid duplicating expensive setup/teardown for every test by using **per-test-suite setup/teardown**:

- Define static shared resources in your test fixture class.
- Implement `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()`.

**Example:**

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_connection_ = new DatabaseConnection("test_db");
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete db_connection_;
    db_connection_ = nullptr;
  }
  static DatabaseConnection* db_connection_;
};

DatabaseConnection* DatabaseTest::db_connection_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryWorks) {
  ASSERT_TRUE(db_connection_->Execute("SELECT 1"));
}
```

**Note:** Tests must not modify shared resources state or must restore any changes.

### 2.2 Use Test Fixtures Efficiently

- Tests in the same fixture class get isolated instances but share fixture code.
- Avoid overly large fixtures that slow test construction or teardown.
- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for per-test prep, but keep them lean.

### 2.3 Disable or Skip Tests When Appropriate

- Temporarily disable flaky or slow tests using `DISABLED_` prefix.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` inside `SetUp()` or tests to programmatically skip based on runtime conditions.

## 3. Writing Efficient Tests

### 3.1 Write Focused, Independent Tests

- Each test should cover one logical unit or scenario.
- Tests should not depend on ordering or side effects from other tests.

### 3.2 Avoid Excessive Assertions in One Test

- Multiple unrelated failures in one test can be hard to debug.
- Prefer more, smaller tests over few, large tests.

### 3.3 Use `ASSERT` and `EXPECT` Wisely

- `ASSERT_*` macros abort the test on failure—use when failure makes continuation invalid.
- `EXPECT_*` macros allow test to continue—use to gather more info during a single test run.

### 3.4 Leverage Test Parameterization

Test the same logic with multiple data inputs using:

- **Value-parameterized tests** (`TEST_P`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`)
- **Typed tests** (`TYPED_TEST`, `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`)

This avoids test duplication and helps manage large test matrices.

## 4. Debugging and Troubleshooting Tips

### 4.1 Detecting and Handling Flaky Tests

Run tests repeatedly and shuffled to expose non-deterministic failures.

### 4.2 Understanding Test Failures in Parallel Runs

Keep in mind:

- Failures in one shard do not stop others by default.
- You may want to enable `--gtest_fail_fast` to halt on first failure.

### 4.3 Common Pitfalls

- Shared mutable state across tests leads to flaky failures.
- Overly stringent `EXPECT_CALL` in mocks can cause brittle tests.

### 4.4 Best Practices for Mock Usage in Scaled Tests

- Set expectations in a single thread before running multithreaded code.
- Use thread-safe mocks and synchronization primitives as needed.

## 6. Additional Resources and Next Steps

- Explore the [`--gtest_*` flags](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#running-test-programs-advanced-options) for advanced test control.
- Learn about [Value- and Type-Parameterized Tests](../guides/core-testing-workflows/parameterized-and-typed-tests.mdx) to scale coverage efficiently.
- Use [Test Filtering and Sharding](../docs/advanced.md#Distributing-Test-Functions-to-Multiple-Machines) in continuous integration setups.
- Reference [Using Mocks in Parallel](../guides/core-testing-workflows/using-mocks.mdx#Using-Threads) for thread safety.

By applying these strategies, you will keep your GoogleTest codebase fast, manageable, and reliable at scale.
