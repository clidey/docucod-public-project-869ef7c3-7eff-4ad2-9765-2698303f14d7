# Test Suite Best Practices

## Overview

This page offers a curated set of best practices to help you write structured, reliable, fast, and maintainable test suites using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Drawing from real-world Google experience, these recommendations focus on test organization, naming conventions, isolation guarantees, flakiness reduction, and execution speed optimization.

By adopting these practices, you will ensure your tests remain effective as your codebase grows, facilitating easier debugging and higher confidence in your software quality.

## 1. Test Suite Organization

### 1.1 Structure Tests Clearly

- Group related tests into logically coherent test suites using `TEST_F` or `TEST_P` with descriptive fixture names.
- Each test case should have a clear purpose and focus on verifying a single behavior or property.
- Use consistent naming conventions for test suites and test cases to reflect the functionality under test.

### 1.2 Use Fixtures Effectively

- Encapsulate common setup and teardown logic in test fixtures to avoid duplication.
- Minimize heavy resource initialization in fixtures to speed up test execution.
- Use fixtures to prepare mock objects and common test data.

### 1.3 Prefer Parameterized Tests When Repetition is Needed

- Use parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) for testing the same behavior over different inputs.
- This reduces boilerplate and improves maintainability.

Good test suite organization makes test intent clear, reduces duplication, and speeds up test maintenance.
</Check>

## 2. Naming Conventions

### 2.1 Test Suites and Fixtures

- Use descriptive fixture names reflecting the component or module being tested. For example, `DatabaseConnectionTest`.

### 2.2 Test Case Names

- Name each test case with a clear description of what it verifies.
- Use `CamelCase` or `snake_case` consistently, e.g., `ReturnsErrorOnInvalidInput` or `returns_error_on_invalid_input`.

### 2.3 Test Names Should Express Behavior

- Use names that tell the story of the behavior being tested, e.g., `HandlesEmptyListGracefully`, `RejectsNegativeValues`.

### 2.4 Naming Mock Classes

- For mocks, use the `Mock` prefix followed by the interface/class being mocked, e.g., `MockFoo`.
- This aligns with GoogleTest convention and helps users quickly identify mocks.

<Note>
Consistent naming improves readability and helps identify test failures quickly.
</Note>

## 3. Test Isolation

### 3.1 Avoid Shared State Between Tests

- Ensure that each test runs in a clean environment and that fixture setup does not create hidden dependencies.
- Use fresh mock objects and test data for each test.
- Avoid static or global variables that can retain state across tests.

### 3.2 Mock Collaborators

- Use GoogleMock to replace dependencies with mocks, allowing control over external interactions.
- Set expectations precisely, but avoid over-specification.
- Use `ON_CALL` to define default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only when you intend to verify calls.

### 3.3 Clear Side Effects

- Ensure your mocks or fakes do not leak state that affects other tests.
- Reset shared resources or singletons explicitly if they're used.

<Check>
Isolated tests reduce flakiness, make failures meaningful, and enable parallel execution.
</Check>

---

## 4. Reducing Flakiness

### 4.1 Avoid Timing Dependencies

- Avoid reliance on real time, sleeps, or arbitrary waits in tests.
- Use mocks and notifications to synchronize asynchronous operations deterministically.

### 4.2 Manage Test Order Dependencies

- Write tests as independent as possible. Tests should not require running in a particular order.

### 4.3 Keep Tests Deterministic

- Avoid random inputs without controlling the seed.
- Stub or mock nondeterministic dependencies.

### 4.4 Debugging Flaky Tests

- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call traces for mock invocations when debugging flaky or failing tests.

<Warning>
Ignoring flakiness harms CI reliability and developer productivity. Address flaky tests immediately.
</Warning>

---

## 5. Keeping Tests Fast

### 5.1 Minimize Expensive Setup

- Avoid expensive resource allocations or external dependencies in test setup.
- Use mocks or fakes for heavy dependencies like databases, file systems, or network.

### 5.2 Use Test Fixtures Judiciously

- Setup what’s needed for each test only. Avoid heavy state that’s unused.

### 5.3 Run Tests in Parallel Where Possible

- Make tests thread-safe and independent to enable parallel execution.

### 5.4 Prefer Lightweight Mocks

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting call warnings while avoiding overhead of `StrictMock` unless strict checking is required.

---

## 6. Recommended Mocking Practices

### 6.1 Use `ON_CALL` for Default Behavior

- Set default mock behavior with `ON_CALL` in your fixture or setup phase.

### 6.2 Use `EXPECT_CALL` Only When Verifying Interactions

- Limit `EXPECT_CALL` to places you explicitly want to check a function is called.
- Overuse of `EXPECT_CALL` leads to brittle tests.

### 6.3 Ordering Expectations

- Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses to enforce call order only when required by the contract.

### 6.4 Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to Avoid Sticky Expectations Causing False Failures

- When specifying multiple similar expectations in sequence, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire them after being matched.

### 6.5 Naming Mock Methods Clearly

- Keep mock method names consistent with the interface.

### 6.6 Handle Move-only Types

- GoogleMock supports move-only types naturally via `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Use lambdas or custom actions to return or consume move-only types when needed.

### 6.7 Use `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` Appropriately

- `NiceMock` suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, making tests less noisy.
- `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as errors, useful when strict contract enforcement is needed.
- Avoid mixing `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` or nesting them.

<Info>
Balancing strictness of mocks is key to maintainable and robust tests.
</Info>

## 7. Verification and Cleanup

### 7.1 Automatic Verification

- GoogleMock automatically verifies expectations when mock objects are destructed.

### 7.2 Manual Verification

- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` to verify expectations before destruction, useful when mocks are heap-allocated.

### 7.3 Allowing Mock Leaks

- Use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock)` if you intentionally don’t want to verify or delete a mock object to suppress leak warnings.

### 7.4 Resetting Mocks

- After verifying and clearing, avoid setting new expectations on the same mock object.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Tips

### 8.1 Unexpected Calls

- Confirm that `EXPECT_CALL` statements cover all expected call patterns.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed logs of actual calls and expectations.

### 8.2 Too Many or Too Few Actions

- Ensure that your `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()` actions match the `Times()` cardinality.

### 8.3 Naming Collisions

- If mocking methods with names defined via macros, confirm that the mock compiles and functions properly (GoogleMock macros support this).

### 8.4 Virtual Destructors

- Ensure that interfaces/classes being mocked have virtual destructors to avoid leaks and undefined behavior.

### 8.5 Handling Non-Default Constructible Return Types

- Provide explicit return values or actions for methods returning such types.

<Warning>
Incorrect or incomplete mock specifications cause hard-to-diagnose failures; use verbose logging to pinpoint issues.
</Warning>
