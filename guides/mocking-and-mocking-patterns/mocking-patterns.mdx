# Best Practices for Mocking and Test Design

## Overview

This guide provides essential strategies for structuring tests that use GoogleMock to achieve better readability, maintainability, and robustness. It highlights best practices in defining mocks and expectations, explains how to avoid common anti-patterns, and introduces advanced features such as `NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and chaining expectations effectively.

Whether you are starting with GoogleMock or looking to refine existing tests, these guidelines will empower you to write clear, expressive, and resilient mock-based tests.

---

## 1. Write Clear and Intent-Focused Tests

- **Aim for readability:** Your tests should clearly document what behavior they expect, so anyone reading the test understands the intent without having to trace through implementation details.
- **Test one behavior per test:** Avoid cramming multiple expectations into a single test. This helps isolate failures and speeds up debugging.
- **Use descriptive test and expectation names:** When possible, name mock expectations with `.Description()` to clarify their purpose.

### Example: Expressive Expectation Naming
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Process(_))
    .Times(2)
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(true))
    .Description("Process called twice to handle valid inputs");
```

---

## 2. Use `ON_CALL` for Default Behavior and `EXPECT_CALL` for Verifications

- **Use `ON_CALL` to set up common default behavior.** This reduces noise and duplication when multiple tests share common mock behavior but do not need to verify call counts or arguments.
- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` only to specify important expectations that your test verifies,** such as "this method must be called with these arguments exactly N times." This keeps tests from being overly constrained and brittle.

<Tip>
Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` can make tests fragile. Prefer `ON_CALL` for behavior and `EXPECT_CALL` for mandatory interactions.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Control Call Cardinalities Precisely

- **Use `Times()` judiciously to specify how many calls you expect.** If omitted, GoogleMock infers cardinality from actions:
  - No `.WillOnce` or `.WillRepeatedly` -> `Times(1)`
  - Multiple `.WillOnce` -> `Times(n)` where n is number of `WillOnce`
  - Combined `.WillOnce` and `.WillRepeatedly` -> `Times(AtLeast(n))`
- **Use `AnyNumber()` when you want to allow any number of calls,** especially to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **Specify `Times(0)` to explicitly disallow calls** to certain methods or arguments.

---

## 4. Sequence Expectations When Call Order Matters

- Use the `InSequence` class when you want to enforce call order:

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Cleanup());
}
```

- For more complex partial orders, use `.After()` clauses with `Expectation` or `ExpectationSet` objects to define dependencies.

<Tip>
Sequences improve test robustness by making call order explicit and avoiding fragile interleaving.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Avoid the "Sticky Expectations" Pitfall

- By default, expectations remain active after their cardinality is met, meaning that if they are called more times, tests will fail.
- To make expectations "retire" after saturation, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()`. This is especially important when chaining multiple `WillOnce` calls to avoid conflicts.

### Example: Retiring Expectations
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(1)).RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(2)).RetiresOnSaturation();
```

- Consider using an explicit `InSequence` block together with `RetiresOnSaturation` to express a strict ordered series of expected calls.

---

## 6. Manage Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls

- **Uninteresting calls:** Calls to mock methods without any matching `EXPECT_CALL`. By default, GoogleMock prints warnings.
- **Unexpected calls:** Calls that have an expectation set but don't match any of the defined expectations (e.g., wrong arguments).

### Strategies:
- Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock<T>` to treat uninteresting calls as failures.
- Add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` when you want to accept other calls gracefully, avoiding warnings.

<Tip>
Avoid indiscriminately adding `EXPECT_CALL`s to silence warnings; this leads to brittle tests. Use `ON_CALL` or switch to `NiceMock` if appropriate.
</Tip>

---

## 7. Use Action Compositions to Simplify Complex Behaviors

- Use built-in actions to handle common needs: `Return()`, `ReturnRef()`, `SetArgPointee()`, `Invoke()`, `DoAll()` etc.
- Chain multiple actions with `DoAll()` when a method has both side effects and return value.

### Example: Return value and modify output argument
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, FetchData(_, _))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<1>(42), Return(true)));
```

- For move-only types or complex behaviors, prefer using lambdas with `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly`.

---

## 8. Simplify Matchers and Use `With()` for Tuple Matching

- Use `_` wildcard matcher liberally for arguments where the exact value is irrelevant.
- Use `With()` clause to match the entire argument list as a tuple when necessary.

### Example: Matching ordered argument tuple
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetRange(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // Expect first argument less than second
```

- Use parameterized matchers and predicates to make your expectations more expressive and maintainable.

---

## 9. Use `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` Judiciously with Overloaded Methods

- When mocking overloaded methods, specify argument matchers or use helper functions like `Const()` to disambiguate.
- Avoid omitting argument lists for overloaded methods, as this causes ambiguity and compiler errors.

### Example: Disambiguating overloads
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(Const(mock), GetBar());  // const method
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetBar());         // non-const method
```

---

## 10. Verify and Clear Expectations Explicitly When Needed

- Normally, GoogleMock verifies expectations on mock destruction.
- For mocks whose lifetimes are not deterministic, use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` to verify explicitly.
- Use the bool return value to check success and assert accordingly.

<Tip>
Do not add new expectations after calling `VerifyAndClearExpectations()`, as behavior is undefined.
</Tip>

---

## 11. Avoid Common Anti-Patterns

### a. Over-Specification of Expectations
- Writing too many expectations for calls whose order or parameters you do not care about.
- Result: brittle tests that break easily when implementation changes.

### b. Mixing `EXPECT_CALL` and Calls Randomly
- Setting expectations after the mock methods are called
- Result: undefined behavior and confusing failures

### c. Not Using Sequences When Order Matters
- Allowing calls to happen in any order where order is important

### d. Forgetting to Mock All Overload Variants
- Leads to hidden calls matched by catch-alls or to ambiguous compiler errors

## 12. Advanced Features

### Using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`

| Type          | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls         | Use Case                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock<T>` | Suppresses warnings                    | Tests that don't care about all calls    |
| `NaggyMock<T>`| Warnings on uninteresting calls (default) | Useful during development/debugging       |
| `StrictMock<T>` | Treats uninteresting calls as errors    | Ensures all calls are explicitly expected |

Example:
```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething());
// No warnings on other calls.
```

### Chaining Expectations and Setting Partial Orders

- Combine `InSequence` and `.After()` clauses for fine control over call order and dependencies across mock methods.
- Use `Expectation` and `ExpectationSet` types from `EXPECT_CALL` to create ordered prerequisite sets.

---

## 13. Useful Tips

- Always place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the public section of mock classes to avoid access issues.
- Use parentheses to disambiguate return or argument types with commas.
- Limit the verbosity of mock output with `--gmock_verbose` for less or more detailed logs.
- To debug why an expectation didnâ€™t match, use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call trace.
- Use `SafeMatcherCast` to handle type mismatches in matchers.

## 14. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                                      | Solution                                         |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------| 
| Uninteresting calls spam console              | Use `NiceMock`, add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`, or adjust verbosity flag |
| Expectations not satisfied unexpectedly       | Run test with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace calls; check call counts and matchers |
| Ambiguous overloaded method calls             | Specify argument matchers or use `Const()` wrapper |
| Duplicate or conflicting `EXPECT_CALL`s       | Remember last matching expectation wins; order matters |
| Memory leaks from mocks                        | Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to suppress leak failures if intentional |
