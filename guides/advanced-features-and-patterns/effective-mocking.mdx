# Effective Mocking with GoogleMock

This guide provides a comprehensive workflow and practical examples to help you effectively use GoogleMock (gMock) for simulating dependencies, specifying call expectations, defining mock behaviors, and controlling call order and cardinalities in your C++ tests. By following these structured patterns and tips, you will create readable, robust, and maintainable mock-based tests.

---

## 1. Understanding GoogleMock Mocking Workflow

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

- Define mock classes that simulate real interfaces or classes.
- Specify precise behaviors and call expectations on mock methods.
- Control invocation order, number of calls, and argument matching.
- Write concise, maintainable tests that can detect bugs reliably.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest usage and C++ testing concepts.
- C++ interface or abstract class to mock (must have virtual methods).
- Inclusion of `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will master the use of GoogleMock to:

- Create reusable mock classes using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Define expectations using `EXPECT_CALL` with fine-grained control.
- Set default behaviors with `ON_CALL` without forcing call expectations.
- Handle method overloads, constness, and move-only types correctly.
- Manage call sequences, cardinalities, and retirement of expectations.
- Effectively troubleshoot common pitfalls in mock setup and usage.

### Time Estimate

Completing this guide and practicing with the examples generally takes 45–60 minutes.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate: assumes basic test writing skills and C++ knowledge.

## 2. Defining Mock Classes

To mock an interface or class, derive a mock class and use `MOCK_METHOD` in the public section for each virtual method you want to mock.

### How to Define Mock Methods

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

- Use parentheses when argument or return types contain commas to avoid parsing errors.
- Always place `MOCK_METHOD` in the `public:` section, regardless of original access specifiers.
- Add qualifiers such as `(const, override)` as needed to match the original method.

### Mocking Overloaded Methods

Mock all overloads explicitly. Use the `Const()` helper to disambiguate const vs non-const overloads.

### Mocking Class Templates

Templates can be mocked like normal classes by templating the mock class accordingly.

### Mocking Non-Virtual Methods

While possible with more advanced techniques, it’s recommended to mock virtual methods or provide interfaces to test against.

## 3. Setting Expectations with EXPECT_CALL

The heart of GoogleMock lies in setting expectations and behaviors using `EXPECT_CALL`. This controls which mock method calls are allowed, how often, with what arguments, in what order, and what they return.

### Basic Syntax

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers))
    .Times(cardinality)
    .WillOnce(action)
    .WillRepeatedly(action);
```

- `mock_object` is your instantiated mock.
- `Method` is the mocked method name.
- `matchers` specify argument constraints (use `_` wildcard for any).

### Specifying Arguments

- Use specific values: `EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(5));`
- Use matchers: `EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(Ge(3)));` (argument >= 3)
- Any argument: `EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(_, _));`
- For overloaded methods, either supply argument types explicitly or use `Const()` for const overloads.

### Cardinalities with Times()

Control how many times a method call is expected.

| Cardinality       | Description                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `Exactly(n)` or `n`| Called exactly `n` times          |
| `AtLeast(n)`      | Called at least `n` times         |
| `AtMost(n)`       | Called at most `n` times          |
| `Between(m, n)`   | Called between `m` and `n` times |
| `AnyNumber()`     | Called any number of times        |

If omitted, GoogleMock infers cardinality from `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` clauses.

### Defining Behavior with Actions

Specify what happens when the mock method is called:

- `WillOnce(Return(value))` — returns `value` once.
- `WillRepeatedly(Return(value))` — returns `value` on all remaining calls.
- Use lambdas or functions for complex behavior.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
    .WillOnce(Return(100))
    .WillOnce(Return(200))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(300));
```

---

## 4. Setting Default Behaviors with ON_CALL

Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior **without** enforcing that the method *must* be called.

### Syntax

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers))
    .WillByDefault(action);
```

- Useful for setting fallback behavior for methods called without an explicit `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Can help suppress warnings by making mocks "nice".

### Typical Use

Often placed in mock class constructors or test fixture `SetUp` to define common behaviors shared across multiple tests.

Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, Sign(_))
    .WillByDefault(Return(-1));
```

---

## 5. Controlling Call Order and Partial Ordering

### Ordering with InSequence

Wrap `EXPECT_CALL`s inside an `InSequence` block to enforce strict call order.

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, A());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, B());
}
```

The calls to `A()` and `B()` must occur in this order.

### Partial Ordering with Sequence Objects

Create `Sequence` objects and specify which sequences each expectation belongs to.

```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, A()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, B()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, C()).InSequence(s2);
```

Defines a partial order DAG: A occurs before B and C; C occurs before subsequent calls.

### After Clause for Complex Ordering

Use `.After(expectations...)` to specify that an expectation should be called only after others.

---

## 6. Managing Expectations and Cardinalities

### Retiring Expectations

By default, expectations remain *active* even after being saturated. Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to make an expectation *retire* immediately after its cardinality is reached.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(7))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

Allows exactly two calls matching `Foo(7)`, then retires the expectation so subsequent calls do not match it.

### Multiple Expectations on the Same Method

Stops search for matching expectation at the newest matching *active* expectation (last declared override the earlier ones).

---

## 7. Advanced Mocking Techniques

### Delegating to Fake or Real Objects

Sometimes you want the default behavior to come from an existing or real implementation.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, DoThis).WillByDefault([this](int n) {
  return real_.DoThis(n);
});
```

This combines realistic behavior with gMock's verification.

### Handling Move-Only Types

`MOCK_METHOD` supports move-only types like `std::unique_ptr`. Set expectations and return them via `WillOnce` and lambdas.

### Mocking Overloaded Methods

Disambiguate with argument matching or `Const(mock)` for const overloads.

### Using Matchers

Powerful built-in and custom matchers allow expressive argument checks; use `_` as a wildcard.

### Combining Actions

Use `DoAll()` to chain multiple actions for a single call.

### Using Checkpoints and Sequences

Insert mock calls as checkpoints to verify phases or interaction points in tests.

### Mocking Destructors

Mock destruction by adding and expecting calls to a mock method such as `Die()` invoked in the destructor.

---

## 8. Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Prefer ON_CALL for Default Behavior

Use `ON_CALL` to set general behavior without forcing call expectations.

### Use EXPECT_CALL to Verify Expected Calls Only

Avoid over-specifying your tests with superfluous expectations. Keep tests resilient.

### Suppress Uninteresting Call Warnings With NiceMock

Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress warnings about unexpected but allowed calls.

### Use StrictMock for Maximum Enforcement

Use `StrictMock<T>` to treat unexpected calls as test failures.

### Don’t Set Expectations After Mock Usage

Always set expectations before testing code invokes the mock methods.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Tips

- If expectations aren’t met, run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed call traces.
- Beware of mismatched argument types or missing matchers causing unexpected call failures.
- Check for unretired expectations when getting saturation or upper-bound errors.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` to verify before mock deletion if needed.
