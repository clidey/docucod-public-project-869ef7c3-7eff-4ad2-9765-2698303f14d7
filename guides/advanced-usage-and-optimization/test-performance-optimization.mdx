# Test Performance and Optimization Tips

Optimize your GoogleMock-based tests for speed and maintainability by adopting proven strategies focused on mocking correctly, isolating tests, and leveraging framework features effectively.

---

## Why Optimize Test Performance?

Slow tests hurt developer productivity and obscure real issues. Properly designed tests run faster, are more reliable, and easier to maintain.

### Common Performance Pitfalls

- Over-mocking large or complex dependencies
- Relying on expensive resources like databases or network in tests
- Testing too many behaviors in one test
- Excessive or improper use of strict expectations

---

## Best Practices to Write Fast, Maintainable Tests

### 1. Use Mocks to Isolate Dependencies

Mocking external or expensive components removes unnecessary delays and flakiness.

- Define mock interfaces for dependencies
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors for mocks
- Set minimal expectations via `EXPECT_CALL` only when verifying interactions

<Tip>
Set expectations to verify *only what matters* for each test. Overly specific or numerous expectations add maintenance burden and slow down tests.
</Tip>

### 2. Favor Test Isolation

Each test should run independently without requiring real external systems.

- Avoid talking to real databases, filesystems, or networks in unit tests
- Inject mocks to simulate slow or failure-prone resources
- Leverage fakes when a working but lightweight implementation helps

### 3. Use `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL` Wisely

- `ON_CALL` for setting default mock behavior without enforcing call counts
- `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to verify the method calls and their arguments

Avoid using excessive `EXPECT_CALL` statements as they introduce overhead and test brittleness.

### 4. Control Call Ordering Only When Necessary

- Use `InSequence` or `.After()` clauses selectively
- Overusing strict ordering makes tests fragile and slower

### 5. Leverage gMock’s Default Actions and Matchers

- Use broad matchers (`_`) when you don’t care about argument values
- Use default actions to reduce test setup code

---

## Leveraging GoogleMock Framework Features for Speed

### Minimize Setup Cost

- Define commonly used `ON_CALL`s in test fixtures
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls and reduce noise

### Simplify Expectation Syntax

- Omit argument matchers if you don’t care about them for non-overloaded methods
- Use parameterless expectations to make tests concise

### Delegate to Real or Fake Objects When Appropriate

- Use delegation patterns to reuse existing implementation while verifying interactions
- Combine mocks with fakes carefully to keep tests fast and meaningful

## Troubleshooting Slow or Brittle Tests

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Running Too Slowly">
**Cause:** Tests hit real resources or do expensive setup.

**Solution:**
- Replace external dependencies with mocks or fakes.
- Use `ON_CALL` to provide simple default return values instead of complex behaviors.
- Avoid unnecessary computation in mock actions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tests Fail or Log Unexpected Calls">
**Cause:** Missing or overly strict `EXPECT_CALL`s leading to unplanned mock calls.

**Solution:**
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings if the calls are indeed expected but unverified.
- Add more general `EXPECT_CALL` with argument matchers like `_` and `.Times(AnyNumber())` to allow other calls.
- Verify you have the right call ordering if using sequences.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Excessive Mock Setup and Compilation Delays">
**Cause:** Large mock classes with many MOCK_METHODs defined inline.

**Solution:**
- Move constructor and destructor definitions of mocks to .cc file to reduce compile time.
- Limit number of mock methods per class when possible.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Beware of overusing strict mocks (`StrictMock`). They can slow down tests and cause fragile failures. Use `NiceMock` or default behavior unless you must enforce strict interaction.
</Tip>

## Practical Example: Optimizing a Unit Test

Imagine you have a component that uses a `Database` interface:

```cpp
class Database {
 public:
  virtual ~Database() {}
  virtual bool Connect() = 0;
  virtual int GetRecord(int id) = 0;
};

class MockDatabase : public Database {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetRecord, (int id), (override));
};
```

A naive test might set many specific `EXPECT_CALL`s with strict `.Times()`.

A faster, maintainable test could:

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::NiceMock;

TEST(MyComponentTest, UsesDatabase) {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;
  // Set default behavior to connect successfully
  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  ON_CALL(mock_db, GetRecord(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));

  // Expect Connect to be called at least once
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(::testing::AtLeast(1));

  MyComponent comp(&mock_db);
  comp.DoWork();
  // Verify behavior... 
}
```

This test:

- Uses `ON_CALL` for defaults to reduce setup code
- Uses `NiceMock` to suppress uninteresting call warnings
- Sets expectations only where crucial

Expected Benefits

- Runs faster by avoiding complex setups and unnecessary matches
- Less brittle when the code changes

---

## Summary

- Mock appropriately to isolate and speed up tests
- Use default behaviors and minimal expectations
- Avoid over-constraining call order unless essential
- Use `NiceMock` to reduce noise and overhead
- Modularize mock declarations to optimize compile times

With disciplined test design and effective use of GoogleMock features, your tests will be fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.

### Troubleshooting

If tests are slow or failing unexpectedly:

- Run with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed call traces
- Ensure `EXPECT_CALL`s are set *before* code execution
- Verify no resource-heavy operations occur during test setup or teardown

<Tip>
Keep tests and mocks simple and focused. Resist introducing complex interactions or state setups within unit tests.
