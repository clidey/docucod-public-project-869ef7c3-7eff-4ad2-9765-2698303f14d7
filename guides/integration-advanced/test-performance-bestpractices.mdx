# Test Performance and Scalability Best Practices

Efficient and scalable test suites are essential to maintain developer productivity and ensure reliable quality as your C++ codebase grows. This guide focuses on actionable strategies to keep your GoogleTest and GoogleMock tests fast, maintainable, and scalable even as thousands of test cases accumulate.

---

## 1. Why Test Performance and Scalability Matter

As you add tests to your project, the total test runtime can expand significantly. Slow tests lead to less frequent test runs, delayed feedback, and ultimately reduced confidence in code changes. Excessive resource consumption during tests also slows down continuous integration (CI) and local development loops.

A scalable test suite should:

- Run quickly even as the number of tests grows
- Minimize unnecessary resource setup and teardown
- Be organized to limit duplicated work
- Make failures easy to debug without rerunning the entire suite

Establishing these foundations helps keep teams confident and productive.

## 2. Structuring Tests for Speed and Maintainability

### 2.1. Keep Tests Independent and Isolated

Each test should be self-contained and not rely on shared, mutable state modified by other tests. GoogleTest automatically ensures each `TEST_F()` fixture instance is fresh per test, which helps maintain isolation.

**Tip:** Avoid global or static variables that might inadvertently create dependencies between tests.

### 2.2. Use Test Fixtures to Share Setup Where Appropriate

To reduce redundant initialization work, group related tests into test suites backed by a `testing::Test` fixture.

- Put expensive construction/setup code in `SetUpTestSuite()` (if available) to share across tests when possible.
- Put lightweight setup code in `SetUp()` to run before each test.

**Example:**

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Runs once before all tests in DatabaseTest
    db.Connect();
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Runs before each test
    db.ResetState();
  }

  static Database db;
};
```

Use shared fixtures only when tests legitimately share immutable state or reset state carefully to avoid cross-test pollution.

### 2.3. Limit Test Data Size and Scope

Design tests to cover relevant edge cases and behaviors using minimal data quantities. Avoid bloated or overly large test inputs.

**Best Practice:** Use parameterized tests to run the same logic against multiple concise data sets instead of creating separate, large test functions.

### 2.4. Avoid Unnecessary Sleep or Timing Dependencies

Tests with arbitrary delays or timeouts slow down the run and reduce determinism. Design tests that simulate timing rather than rely on waits.

### 2.5. Prefer Fast and Deterministic Mocks Over Slow Integration

Mocks created by GoogleMock allow you to isolate components and test logic without expensive dependencies, such as databases or external services.

- Use `ON_CALL()` in fixtures to set default behaviors.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL()` sparingly just to verify essential interactions.

Avoid end-to-end tests that require complex setup except where integration is the test's focus.

---

## 3. Strategies to Minimize Test Runtime

### 3.1. Reuse Expensive Resources Across Tests

When resource setup is costly (like opening a database connection), use shared test fixtures or global environment setup with proper ordering.

- GoogleTest supports global environment classes via `::testing::Environment`.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()`/`TearDownTestSuite()` for one-time costs per suite.

### 3.2. Cache and Reuse Computations

If tests repeat expensive computations or data generation, cache results in fixture static members or external helpers.

### 3.3. Run Tests in Parallel Where Possible

Modern CI systems and local builds can execute independent tests in parallel.

- Organize tests so they don't interfere with each other.
- Avoid shared state that leads to race conditions.

GoogleTest itself supports running tests in parallel using test sharding or external tooling.

### 3.4. Use `EXPECT_*` Instead of `ASSERT_*` When Suitable

`EXPECT_*` assertions record failure but allow the test to continue, helping detect multiple issues in one run. This reduces the need for multiple runs and speeds up debugging.

---

## 4. Writing Maintainable and Scalable Test Suites

### 4.1. Group Related Tests Logically

Testing related functionality together helps organize the test suite, makes setup/reuse easier, and speeds up navigation. Use consistent naming conventions for test suites and test names.

### 4.2. Keep Tests Small and Focused

Each test should verify one behavior or property. This makes failures easier to analyze and reduces overlap.

### 4.3. Limit Over-Specification in Mocks

Avoid overly strict expectations that must be updated every time implementation details change. Use general matchers (`_`) and `NiceMock` or `NaggyMock` as appropriate to reduce test brittleness.

### 4.4. Document Complex Mocking or Sequences

When setting strict call order or complex expectations, comment test code to clarify intent for future maintainers.

### 4.5. Regularly Review and Refactor Tests

Just as production code benefits from refactoring, test code should be reviewed and improved to remove duplication, improve readability, and maintain speed.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Running Too Long">
- Identify slow tests individually by measuring runtime.
- Check for unnecessary setup/teardown or large data processing.
- Split slow integration tests from fast unit tests.
- Consider disabling flaky or slow tests temporarily.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Flakiness Due to Shared State">
- Ensure no shared mutable static/global state across tests.
- Use fresh fixtures for each test.
- Use synchronization primitives if tests run in parallel.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mocking Issues Causing Failures or Slowdowns">
- Make sure `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` are set before mock method invocations.
- Use `NiceMock` to reduce spurious warnings about uninteresting calls.
- Avoid setting excessive strictness unless necessary.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations to improve matching.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build and Compilation Slowdowns Due to Mocks">
- Move mock class constructors and destructors into source files instead of header inline.
- Limit mocking of very large classes to essential methods.
