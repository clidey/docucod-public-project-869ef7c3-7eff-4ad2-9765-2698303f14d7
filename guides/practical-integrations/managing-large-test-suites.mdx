# Managing Large and Legacy Test Suites

## Introduction

As your codebase grows, so does the number and complexity of tests. Managing large and legacy test suites effectively is crucial to maintain high-quality code without sacrificing development agility. This page guides you through proven strategies to organize, refactor, and scale your tests so they remain reliable, maintainable, and performant.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Objective
Help developers adopt practices for structuring, naming, and maintaining large sets of tests, including legacy code, to improve discoverability, reusability, and execution efficiency.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest concepts from the [primer](primer.md).
- A functioning build and test system integrated with GoogleTest.
- Access to your project's test source code.

### Expected Outcomes
- Logical grouping and naming conventions for large test suites.
- Methods to reduce build and runtime overhead.
- Best practices for legacy test refactoring.
- Guidelines for environment setup and test discovery.

### Time Estimate
Ongoing process; initial reorganization and implementation may take several hours to days depending on test suite size.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced

---

## Organizing Large Test Suites

### 1. Logical Test Grouping

- **Use Test Suites to Group Related Tests:** Use `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` with consistent suite names that reflect the module or component under test.
- **Leverage Test Fixtures for Shared Setup:** Employ `TEST_F()` and fixture classes to share common setup/teardown code, reducing duplication and improving clarity.

### 2. Test Naming Conventions

Adopt clear, self-explanatory test and test suite names that:
- Follow consistent style (PascalCase without underscores).
- Reflect tested functionality or behavior (e.g., `LoginManagerTest` with tests like `HandlesEmptyPassword`).
- Avoid ambiguous or overly generic names.

### 3. Structuring Files and Directories

- Organize test files in directory structures mirroring source code.
- Use naming suffixes like `_test.cc` for test files.
- Group fixtures and related mocks alongside test code for maintainability.

### 4. Use Parameterized Tests When Appropriate

Reduce duplication by employing value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P()`) when the same test logic applies to multiple input scenarios.

---

## Managing Legacy Tests

### 1. Audit and Categorize Legacy Tests

- Identify flaky, brittle, or slow tests.
- Categorize tests by coverage, criticality, and dependencies.

### 2. Incremental Refactoring

- Start by refactoring tests to use fixtures instead of duplicating setup.
- Rename tests using consistent naming conventions.
- Add or improve assertions for clearer test intent.

### 3. Isolation and Independence

- Ensure legacy tests do not depend on shared mutable state.
- Fix dependencies that cause tests to interfere, by moving shared resources to fixtures or mocks.

### 4. Integration with Modern Practices

- Convert legacy test code to use GoogleTest macros (`TEST()`, `TEST_F()`) instead of homemade frameworks.
- Where applicable, introduce mocks with GoogleMock to decouple dependencies.

---

## Speed and Scalability Considerations

### 1. Selective Test Execution

- Use command-line filtering flags to run subsets of tests (`--gtest_filter=...`).
- Organize critical tests for fast execution; defer slow or integration tests.

### 2. Parallel and Sharded Runs

- Integrate tests into CI systems supporting parallel execution to reduce wall time.

### 3. Minimize Build Impact

- Reduce test compilation time by separating mock class constructor/destructor definitions from headers.
- Organize test code to limit recompilation of unrelated tests.

---

## Environment Setup Best Practices

- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive global initialization shared by tests in a suite.
- Use environment-level setup [testing::Environment](../advanced.md#global-set-up-and-tear-down) for cross-suite initialization.

---

## Test Discovery and Maintenance

- Avoid requiring manual enumeration of test cases; rely on GoogleTest's automatic test registration.
- Use consistent naming and directory structures to support automated tooling.
- Regularly run and maintain tests to avoid accumulation of ignored flaky tests.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Avoid Over-Specification in Legacy Mocking:** When adding mocks in old test code, start with `ON_CALL()` to set default behavior and add specific `EXPECT_CALL()` only for verified interactions.
- **Suppress Uninteresting Call Warnings:** Use `NiceMock` for mocks in large suites to reduce noise.
- **Retire Expectations Appropriately:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` in expectations involving repetitive calls to avoid sticky expectation pitfalls in legacy tests.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Slow Builds or Test Runs

- Look for duplicated or large test fixtures causing long setup times.
- Consider parallelizing tests or splitting slow tests.

### Flaky Legacy Tests

- Add explicit setup and teardown to isolate tests.
- Refactor shared dependencies to use mocks or fakes.

### Unexpected Mock Failures

- Verify all expectations are set before exercising tested code.
- Use `.Times(AnyNumber())` or catch-all `EXPECT_CALL()` to avoid uninteresting call errors.

## Example: Refactoring Legacy Test to Fixture

```cpp
// Legacy repeated setup
TEST(FooTests, Test1) {
  Foo foo;
  foo.Init(1);
  EXPECT_EQ(foo.DoWork(), 42);
}

TEST(FooTests, Test2) {
  Foo foo;
  foo.Init(1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(foo.IsReady());
}

// Refactored with fixture
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  FooTest() { foo_.Init(1); }
  Foo foo_;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, Test1) {
  EXPECT_EQ(foo_.DoWork(), 42);
}

TEST_F(FooTest, Test2) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(foo_.IsReady());
}
```
