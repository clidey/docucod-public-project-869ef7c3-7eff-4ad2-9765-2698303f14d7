# Scaling Tests and Integrating with CI

## Overview

This guide empowers you to efficiently scale your testing efforts using GoogleTest and seamlessly integrate your tests with Continuous Integration (CI) environments. Learn how to organize, filter, and distribute tests for faster execution while maintaining clarity in reporting. You will also find strategies to effectively integrate with common CI systems, manage large test suites, and optimize parallelism.

---

## 1. Scaling Tests Efficiently

### 1.1 Understanding Test Scalability Challenges

When your project grows, so does the number and complexity of tests. Running all tests sequentially can slow down development feedback loops and CI pipelines. GoogleTest offers flexible features to handle these challenges by enabling parallel test execution, test sharding, and selective test running.

### 1.2 Running Tests in Parallel

To maximize throughput, distribute tests across multiple CPU cores or machines.

- **Using `--gtest_parallel` with third-party wrappers:**
  GoogleTest itself does not provide built-in parallel execution, but you can use wrappers like [bazel](https://bazel.build) or external tools that run multiple test binaries in parallel.

- **Test Sharding (Splitting tests across multiple processes):**

  GoogleTest supports *test sharding*, which splits tests logically across different runs. This enables running tests on multiple machines or parallel executors.

  Use these environment variables:

  - `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: Total number of shards (e.g., total machines).
  - `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: Index of the current shard (0-based).

  Example workflow:

  ```bash
  # Shard 0 on machine 1
  GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 ./your_test_binary

  # Shard 1 on machine 2
  GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1 ./your_test_binary
  ```

  GoogleTest automatically selects which tests to run on which shard, ensuring no duplication.

### 1.3 Filtering Tests Selectively

Running only relevant tests can speed up verification.

- Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to run a subset of tests matching a pattern.

- The filter syntax supports wildcards (`*`) and negations (`-`).

Example:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.*Monday*
```

### 1.4 Randomizing and Repeating Tests

You can detect flaky tests or order dependencies by using:

- `--gtest_shuffle`: Run tests in randomized order to expose dependencies.
- `--gtest_repeat=N`: Run the entire test suite N times to catch intermittent failures.

Use them combined with the above filters and shards for better reliability.

### 1.5 Sharing Expensive Setup Between Tests

Leveraging shared fixtures or global test environments reduces redundant initialization costs.

- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` in your test fixtures for per-suite setup/teardown.
- Use global `Environment` subclasses for test-wide setup and teardown.

Refer to [Fixtures Setup and TearDown](../core-testing-workflows/fixtures-setup-teardown.md) for best practices.

## 2. Integrating GoogleTest with Continuous Integration Systems

### 2.1 CI Systems Overview

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with most CI systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Travis CI).

Key to integration is ensuring reliable test execution, reporting, and scalability.

### 2.2 Test Execution in CI Pipelines

- Build your test binaries as part of your CI jobs.
- Run tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` or filtered subsets depending on your pipeline needs.
- Use environment variables to shard tests across multiple CI agents.

### 2.3 Emitting Machine-Readable Test Reports

GoogleTest supports generating XML and JSON test results suitable for consumption by CI dashboards.

- Use the flag `--gtest_output=xml:<output_path>` to generate JUnit-style XML output.
- Use `--gtest_output=json:<output_path>` to generate JSON reports.

Example:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:artifacts/test_results.xml
```

Make sure to publish these artifacts from your CI job for easy inspection.

### 2.4 Controlling Test Behavior with Flags

Fine-tune your tests in CI by setting GoogleTest flags:

- `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop execution on first failure.
- `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` to include temporarily disabled tests.
- `--gtest_random_seed` to reproduce flaky test orders.

These flags can be supplied as command-line arguments or environment variables.

### 2.5 Integrating with Common Build Systems

- For **Bazel**: GoogleTest binaries can be run via `bazel test` which supports sharding and concurrency out of the box.

- For **CMake**: Use `ctest` with parallel job settings and pass GoogleTest flags through.

- For **Makefile** or custom scripts: orchestrate test shards manually using environment variables above.

## 3. Advanced Scaling Strategies

### 3.1 Programmatic Test Registration

You can register tests dynamically at runtime based on external configuration, enabling fine-grained control over test sets in CI.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::RegisterTest;

void RegisterTestsForParams(const std::vector<int>& params) {
  for (int param : params) {
    RegisterTest("MySuite", ("Test" + std::to_string(param)).c_str(), nullptr,
             std::to_string(param).c_str(), __FILE__, __LINE__, 
             [=]() -> MyTestFixture* { return new MyTestFixture(param); });
  }
}
```

Call this before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to dynamically add test instances.

### 3.2 Using Parameterized and Typed Tests for Coverage

- **Value-Parameterized Tests** (`TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) enable running the same test logic with different input data.
- **Typed Tests** (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`) enable running the same test with multiple types.

These tests scale coverage while minimizing code duplication.

Review [Advanced Test Structures](../core-testing-workflows/advanced-test-structures.md) to master their use.

### 3.3 Managing Large Test Suites

- Organize tests into suites by feature or module.
- Use naming conventions and filters to run targeted subsets.
- Employ sharding and parallelizing CI jobs for large test codebases.

---

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- Always instantiate parameterized tests with meaningful and diverse parameters to cover edge cases.
- Use descriptive `name_generator` functors to generate unique test names for parameterized tests.
- Avoid mixing test macros (`TEST()` and `TEST_F()`) within the same suite to prevent fixture conflicts.
- Monitor flaky tests with repeated test runs and random test ordering.
- Capture and publish detailed test output, including XML/JSON reports for CI visibility.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 5.1 Tests Not Running or Being Discovered

- Verify tests are linked correctly.
- Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()`.
- Check `--gtest_filter` settings to ensure tests are included.

### 5.2 Problems with Test Sharding

- Confirm environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` are set properly.
- Avoid overlapping indices or inconsistent total shards.

### 5.3 Uninstantiated Parameterized Tests

- Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(MyTestSuite)` to suppress warnings if necessary.

### 5.4 Flaky Tests and Ordering Issues

- Use `--gtest_shuffle` and `--gtest_repeat` to detect and localize flaky tests.

### 5.5 Test Output Issues in CI

- Confirm that XML/JSON output paths are writable and configured as CI artifacts.
- Suppress unwanted console output by removing listeners if customizing output.
