# Sample Projects and Real-World Patterns

Explore curated sample projects that demonstrate key GoogleTest and GoogleMock patterns employed in major open source and enterprise codebases. This page highlights design choices, CI integration, and pragmatic test structures to help you apply proven testing techniques effectively.

---

## 1. Purpose and Value of This Page

This page serves as a practical showcase of how GoogleTest and GoogleMock are used in substantial real-world projects. By studying these curated examples, you will understand:

- Which testing patterns are most effective in diverse codebases.
- How to organize your tests with maintainability and readability in mind.
- Ways to integrate tests seamlessly into Continuous Integration (CI) workflows.

---

## 2. Navigating Sample Projects

We present the sample projects progressively, from simple to complex, covering various testing styles, including:

### 2.1 Classic Unit Tests
- Small, focused tests targeting individual units or functions.
- Emphasis on using mock objects for isolating dependencies.

### 2.2 Integration and System-style Patterns
- Tests that verify end-to-end functionality.
- Use of fixtures and parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios.

### 2.3 Advanced Patterns
- Usage of sequences and expectations to enforce call order.
- Delegation to fakes and real objects for hybrid testing.

### 2.4 CI Integration Examples
- Samples demonstrating automated test discovery.
- Examples of test parallelization and resource sharing.

## 3. Key Design Choices Illustrated

Each sample project is annotated with explanations of critical design decisions such as:

- **Mock Class Definitions:** Using `MOCK_METHOD` macros correctly in public sections.
- **Expectation Management:** Balancing `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` for robust tests.
- **Use of Matchers:** Practical examples of simple to complex argument matchers.
- **Test Fixture Usage:** How and when to reuse test environments.
- **Handling Overloaded Methods:** Concrete examples of mocking overloaded functions with clear `MOCK_METHOD` syntax.

These insights help you to avoid common pitfalls and write tests that stand the test of time.

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI) Test Structure

The examples include pragmatic approaches to embedding GoogleTest and GoogleMock in CI pipelines:

- Structuring test binaries for incremental running.
- Reporting and interpreting test results.
- Strategies for identifying test flakiness and intermittent failures.

---

## 5. How To Use This Page Effectively

- Start by browsing the simpler sample projects to ground yourself in GoogleMock’s mocking patterns.
- Progress to projects demonstrating mixed real-world challenges like multithreading and complex interfaces.
- Focus on test organization principles demonstrated to maintain clarity and scalability.
- Use the projects’ CI setups as templates for automating your own test suites.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Mocks Not Working as Expected:** Review mock method declarations, especially virtual specifiers and correct use of `MOCK_METHOD`.
- **Unwanted Warnings About Uninteresting Calls:** Consider using `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on calls you do not wish to explicitly expect.
- **Tests Failing with Unexpected Calls:** Verify your `EXPECT_CALL` orders and make sure expectations precede code execution.
- **Performance Issues in Large Test Suites:** Refer to guides on optimizing test suite performance and managing test concurrency.

For detailed troubleshooting, the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues.mdx) guide provides practical advice.
