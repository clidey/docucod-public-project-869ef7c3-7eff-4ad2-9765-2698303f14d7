# Performance Optimization for Large Test Suites

GoogleTest is designed for robustness and expressivity, but as your test suite grows, test execution time can increase significantly. This guide focuses on practical strategies to keep your test runs fast and efficient, enabling smooth development even with large and complex test sets.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Learn how to optimize the performance of your GoogleTest test suites. This includes techniques such as selective test execution, running tests in parallel, and minimizing test dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- A working GoogleTest test suite.
- Familiarity with running tests using the GoogleTest executable.
- Basic knowledge of test filtering and test infrastructure.

### Expected Outcome
By applying these techniques, you'll reduce the overall test execution time and improve CI feedback loops without sacrificing test coverage.

### Time Estimate
Up to 1 hour to apply selective test execution and parallelization setup, depending on your test suite size and existing infrastructure.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## 2. Step-by-Step Optimization Techniques

### 2.1 Selective Test Execution via Filtering

GoogleTest allows you to run a subset of tests using filters specified by the `--gtest_filter` flag.

#### Steps:
1. Identify the test cases or test suites to run selectively.
2. Run the test executable with the filter flag:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
```

3. You can use wildcards `*` and negate patterns with `-`:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.*-MySuite.UnstableTest
```

This runs all tests in `MySuite` except `UnstableTest`.

#### Expected Result:
Only the specified tests run, reducing runtime and focusing on relevant scenarios.

#### Tips:
- Use filters during development to run only the tests related to your changes.
- Combine filters cleverly for nightly or CI executions.

---

### 2.2 Parallel Test Execution

Because GoogleTest executables are independent of each other, you can run multiple test binaries concurrently to shorten total execution time.

#### Steps:
1. Split your tests into multiple test binaries or shards.
2. Use your CI system or shell scripting to run test binaries in parallel.
3. Alternatively, use test runners or wrappers that support parallelism.

For example, running tests with GNU Parallel:

```bash
parallel ./test_binary ::: test_part1 test_part2 test_part3
```

#### Best Practices:
- Ensure tests have no shared state or dependencies, which can cause flaky results when running in parallel.
- Aggregate test reports after parallel runs for consolidated feedback.

#### Expected Result:
Total test suite runtime approaches the longest individual test segment instead of the total cumulative time.

---

### 2.3 Minimize Test Dependencies

Tests that depend heavily on slow resources or require sequential setup block parallelism.

#### Best Practices:
- Avoid shared global state.
- Use mocks or fakes (see [Creating and Using Mock Objects](guides/mocking-techniques/creating-mocks)) to isolate components.
- Use `ON_CALL()` to provide default mock behavior without requiring strict expectations.
- Prefer stateless utilities over expensive setup.
- Group tests logically by dependencies and prioritize faster paths.

#### Expected Result:
Tests become more independent and suitable for parallel execution.

## 3. Examples

### Example 1: Running a Filtered Test Set

```bash
# Run only tests under MathTests except a known flaky one.
./math_tests --gtest_filter=MathTests.*-MathTests.FlakyTest
```

### Example 2: Parallel Execution with Bazel

If using Bazel, tests are automatically sharded and run in parallel unless configured otherwise:

```bash
bazel test //... --jobs=8
```

### Example 3: Mocking to Speed Up Tests

Create mocks for slow external dependencies:

```cpp
class MockDatabase : public DatabaseInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string& query), (override));
};

// Use NiceMock to ignore uninteresting call warnings:
using ::testing::NiceMock;

TEST(ServiceTest, UsesMockDB) {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;
  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query("SELECT * FROM users")).WillOnce(Return(10));
  ...
}
```

This avoids slow real database operations during tests.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Tests run longer than expected**: Check for tests that use real slow dependencies instead of mocks.
- **Flaky tests in parallel execution**: Make sure tests do not share global state or use improper synchronization.
- **Unintended test runs**: Review your `--gtest_filter` patterns for typos or unexpected ranges.

### Best Practices

- Favor `ON_CALL` for default mock behaviors; use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you need to verify a call.
- Group tests that share setup to avoid redundant initialization.
- Regularly profile test execution using available tools to find bottlenecks.

### Performance Considerations

- Compile mocks separately to reduce build times.
- Cache expensive setup steps in test fixtures.
- Limit test output verbosity for faster completion.

### Alternative Approaches

- Use Bazel or CTest for built-in parallel test execution support.
- Employ test sharding for huge test suites.

Use `--gtest_filter` to run only relevant tests, significantly reducing elapsed test time.

<Tip>
Always place `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising mocks; failure to do so results in undefined behavior and potential memory leaks.
</Tip>

<Note>
Using `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls, which helps keep output clean when tests do not explicitly expect every mock method call.
</Note>

<Warning>
Avoid writing flaky tests that depend on execution order unless explicitly controlled with sequences, as they will erode confidence and slow down your pipeline.
</Warning>
