# Test Performance Optimization

Optimize your test suite to run efficiently and scale with your project by following these proven strategies. This guide focuses on practical, actionable tips for speeding up test execution, managing test data effectively, harnessing parallelization, and handling large or complex test suites. Whether you maintain a small project or a vast codebase, these techniques will help keep your tests fast, reliable, and maintainable.

### 1. Workflow Overview

**Objective:** Accelerate test execution and resource management for large C++ codebases using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

**Prerequisites:**
- Functional GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup.
- Existing tests or a test suite to optimize.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Reduced test runtimes.
- Better management of test data and dependencies.
- Effective use of system resources for parallel testing.

**Time Estimate:**
- Initial optimization setup: 1-3 hours.
- Incremental speedups with ongoing tuning.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced, depending on the project's complexity.

### 2. Strategies for Improving Test Performance

#### 2.1 Minimize Work per Test

- **Target Small Units:** Write focused unit tests instead of large integration tests when possible.
- **Avoid Expensive Operations:** Mock out slow or non-deterministic dependencies.
- **Use `ON_CALL` Wisely:** Set default actions to avoid unnecessary setup overhead.

#### 2.2 Manage Test Data Efficiently

- **Reuse Test Fixtures:** Use `TEST_F` and fixture setup/teardown to share common initialization.
- **Avoid Global State Mutations:** Keep tests independent to enable sharding and parallelism.
- **Use Lightweight Data Structures:** Minimize large allocations or expensive computations in test data.

#### 2.3 Parallelize Test Execution

- **Employ GoogleTest’s `--jobs` Flag:** Utilize built-in parallel test execution to spread workload across cores.
- **Isolate Tests:** Ensure tests do not share resources or depend on run order to allow safe parallel execution.
- **Distribute Tests by Test Suite or Label:** Organize tests logically to run related ones together or in parallel batches.

#### 2.4 Optimize Mock Usage

- **Use `NiceMock` for Uninteresting Calls:** Suppresses warnings on mock methods called without explicit expectations, reducing noisy output during large test runs.
- **Limit Excessive Expectations:** Avoid over-specifying mock expectations to minimize overhead and brittle tests.
- **Predefine Common Actions:** Use `ON_CALL` and global `DefaultValue<T>` settings to reduce repetitive `EXPECT_CALL` setups.

#### 2.5 Cache and Persist Results

- **Cache Expensive Setup:** For tests requiring heavy resource preparation, cache or mock the necessary state.
- **Use User-Defined Test Properties:** Mark tests that depend on external states; skip or run selectively as needed.

### 3. Implementing Efficient Mock Classes

GoogleMock offers `MOCK_METHOD` macros to create mocks with minimal code. To optimize mock performance:

- Prefer mocking only necessary methods.
- Use `MOCK_METHOD` in the public section irrespective of the original method’s access level to ensure expectations can be set externally.
- Avoid complex side effects in `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` to minimize overhead.

Example of overriding default mock behavior for efficiency:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockProcessor {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Process, (int data), (override));

  MockProcessor() {
    ON_CALL(*this, Process(::testing::_))
        .WillByDefault(::testing::Return(0));
  }
};
```

This sets a default fast-return that won't slow tests unless explicitly overridden.

### 4. Parallel Testing Best Practices

- **Avoid Shared, Mutable State:** Concurrent tests must not write to shared globals without synchronization.
- **Use Thread-Safe Mocks and Stubs:** GoogleMock’s internal locking ensures thread safety but design your code with care.
- **Partition Large Test Suites:** Run tests in isolated processes or containers to manage resource constraints.

To enable parallel execution using GoogleTest:

```bash
test_binary --jobs=4
```

This runs tests in parallel on 4 CPU cores.

### 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Cause                     | Solution                                       |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Slow test runs                | Expensive setup per test   | Cache common fixtures; reduce scope             |
| Flaky tests in parallel       | Shared mutable state       | Isolate tests; avoid globals                     |
| Mock warnings on uninteresting calls | Missing `EXPECT_CALL` or `NiceMock` not used | Use `NiceMock<T>` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` |
| Excessive memory usage        | Large objects per test     | Use move semantics; delete mocked objects early |

### 6. Advanced Techniques

- **Retiring Expectations:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations non-sticky, enabling smooth action transitions.
- **Expectation Sequences:** Use `Sequence` and `InSequence` for ordered mocks to minimize test failures due to call ordering.
- **Using Checkpoints:** Employ `MockFunction` to insert checkpoints in test flows for better diagnostics and controlled parallel flows.
