## 2. Diagnosing Common Failure Categories

### A. Unexpected Calls

**Symptoms:**
- Test output shows failures like "Unexpected mock function call".
- The message includes the actual function call arguments and a list of expectations that were tried but did not match.

**What it means:**
- Your test code called a mock method with arguments not matching any `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Possible causes:
  - The argument values don’t match the specified matchers.
  - The expected call was not set up.
  - The mocked method has multiple competing expectations and the precedence order causes mismatch.

**How to resolve:**
- Check all `EXPECT_CALL` for this mock method and verify argument matchers are accurate.
- Use `_` wildcard in matchers if you only care about certain arguments.
- Confirm the call order if sequences or `After` constraints are configured.
- Add a catch-all expectation if other calls are expected:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(ExpectedValue)).WillOnce(Return(...));
```

**Debug Tip:** Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see all matched calls, expectations, and stack traces.

### B. Excessive Calls

**Symptoms:**
- Test output states "Mock function called more times than expected".
- Actual call count exceeds expectation.

**What it means:**
- Your test code called the mock method more times than allowed by `Times()` or `WillOnce()` clauses.

**How to resolve:**
- Review the `Times()` specification on `EXPECT_CALL` for the method.
- Use `Times(AnyNumber())` if multiple calls are expected without fixed limits.
- Check for loops or retries in your tested code that may invoke the method too often.

**Example fix:**

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### C. Unsatisfied Expectations

**Symptoms:**
- Failures indicating expected calls were never made, or called fewer times than expected.
- Messages like "Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL..."

**What it means:**
- An expected mock method call did not occur (or was called less frequently).
- May indicate logic path skipped or test setup incomplete.

**How to resolve:**
- Confirm test exercises the code path invoking the expected method.
- Check that the matchers and argument values match the actual calls.
- If using sequences or `After`, ensure pre-requisite expectations are fulfilled.

### D. Calling Real Methods Instead of Mock Methods

**Symptoms:**
- Real implementation gets called instead of mock methods.

**What it means:**
- The method you tried to mock is not `virtual`.
- gMock can only mock `virtual` functions (unless using advanced dependency injection).

**How to resolve:**
- Change method to `virtual` in interface or base class.
- Alternatively, refactor to mock interfaces or adaptors.

### E. Leaked Mock Objects

**Symptoms:**
- Errors at program exit reporting "leaked mock objects found".
- Expectations on mock objects are not verified.

**What it means:**
- You allocated mocks dynamically and did not delete them.
- As a result, GoogleMock cannot verify expectations.

**How to resolve:**
- Ensure all mocks are properly destroyed before test completion.
- Use stack-allocated mocks or manage lifetime carefully.
- Use `testing::Mock::AllowLeak(&mock)` to suppress if intentional.

## 3. Reading and Interpreting GoogleMock Output

### Enabling Verbose Mode

Run your tests with the flag:

```
--gmock_verbose=info
```

This prints matching expectations, function calls, argument values, and stack traces for all mock calls.

### Common Log Messages Explained

| Message | Explanation | Next Steps |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `EXPECT_CALL` invoked | Your expectation is registered | Verify the expectation's arguments and cardinality |
| Mock function call matches `EXPECT_CALL` | Method call matched an expectation | Check if matched as intended |
| Unexpected mock function call | Call did not match any expectation | Add or adjust expectations |
| Too few/too many actions | Actions specified do not match expected call count | Add or remove `WillOnce` or `WillRepeatedly` clauses |
| Mock function called more times than expected | Over-saturation of call count | Relax `Times()`, or fix tested code calling too often |
| Uninteresting mock function call | No expectations set for this method | Add catch-all expectation or use `NiceMock`

### Example

```text
Unexpected mock function call - returning default value.
    Function call: Foo(3)
Google Mock tried the following 1 expectation, but it didn't match:
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5))...
  Expected arg #0: is equal to 5
           Actual: 3
         Expected: to be called once
           Actual: never called - unsatisfied and active
```

Indicates the mock's method `Foo` was called with `3` instead of the expected `5`.

## 4. Practical Tips & Best Practices

### Always Set Explicit Expectations For Interesting Calls
Do not rely on default or uninteresting call behavior for calls whose correctness you want to verify.

### Use Wildcard Matchers Prudently
Wildcards (`_`) help avoid brittle tests but overuse may hide legitimate bugs.

### Order Your Expectations From General to Specific
Remember GoogleMock matches in reverse declaration order; put catch-all expectations early.

### Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to Manage Repeated Calls
If you expect a call to happen a limited number of times and want later calls to match lesser expectations, use this clause.

### Run Tests With `--gmock_verbose=info` During Debugging
This gives visibility into mock calls and internal matching decisions.

### Be Cautious with Complex Sequences and Partial Orders
Misconfigured sequences (`InSequence`) or `After()` clauses may cause unexpected failures.

### Always Mock `virtual` Methods
Ensure your mocks override virtual functions; otherwise, they will fall back on real impl.

### Verify and Clear Expectations Explicitly if Needed
Call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` to force check mocks if lifetime is unusual.

### Use `NiceMock` to Suppress Noisy Uninteresting Call Warnings
When you don’t care about some mock methods, wrap the mock type with `NiceMock`.

### Avoid Leaking Mocks
Leaks mean expectations are not checked. Use RAII or manual deletion.

## 5. Troubleshooting Flaky or Misleading Failures

- **Mismatch of Argument Types:** Check if argument types and matcher types are compatible.
- **Const Parameter Warnings on MSVC:** Remove redundant `const` for parameters to avoid compiler warnings.
- **Multiple Failure Messages for One Expectation:** gMock may print multiple failure reports for an unmet expectation at different points - this is intentional.
- **Default Actions Not Triggered:** If no default action set and unexpected calls appear, add `ON_CALL` to specify defaults.

## 6. Sample Common Fix Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unexpected Call
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(5));
... calls Func(3) ...
```

**Fix:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(5));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_)).Times(AnyNumber());  // Accept all others
```

### Scenario 2: Excessive Calls
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_)).Times(1);
... calls Func() twice ...
```

**Fix:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_)).Times(AtMost(2));
```

### Scenario 3: Leaked Mock Objects

```cpp
MockFoo* mock = new MockFoo;
EXPECT_CALL(*mock, Func());
// mock not deleted
```

**Fix:**
```cpp
MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func());
```

or

```cpp
delete mock;
```

### Scenario 4: Mocked Non-Virtual Method

The real method is called instead of mock.

**Fix:**
- Make the method `virtual` in the base class/interface.
- Refactor to mock through an interface.

## 7. Additional Diagnostic Techniques

- Enable stack traces for warnings with `--gtest_stack_trace_depth=N`.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` with `.Times(AnyNumber())` on less-interesting methods.
- Write isolated test cases to minimize interference.
- Break complex expectations into smaller atomic parts for easier debugging.

<Tip>
For ongoing debugging, add `--gmock_verbose=info` to see full expectation-call matching and call stack. Use `NiceMock` or catch-all expectations to reduce noise from uninteresting calls.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Unleaked mocks at test exit can prevent verification of expectations and cause false positives. Always delete or appropriately scope mocks, or use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional.
</Warning>

<Note>
Calls to non-virtual methods cannot be mocked by GoogleMock directly and will invoke the real method instead.
