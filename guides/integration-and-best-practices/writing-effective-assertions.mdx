# Writing Clear and Effective Assertions

## Introduction

Assertions are the backbone of GoogleTest's testing framework, enabling you to state expectations about your code's behavior explicitly. This guide dives into best practices for leveraging GoogleTest’s assertion macros and creating custom assertions that provide clear, actionable diagnostic messages. By mastering assertions, you will write tests that not only verify correctness but also simplify debugging and maintenance.

---

## Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

GoogleTest provides a rich suite of macros to verify conditions and values in your tests. Assertions in GoogleTest come in pairs with two key behavior types:

- **EXPECT_*** assertions generate *nonfatal* failures, allowing the test to continue even if an assertion fails.
- **ASSERT_*** assertions generate *fatal* failures, aborting the current function immediately on failure.

Choose between these based on how critical the verification is to the subsequent test logic. For example, use `ASSERT_*` when it’s unsafe or meaningless to continue after failure (like checking that a pointer is not null before dereferencing).

### Common Assertion Categories

- **Boolean conditions**: `EXPECT_TRUE()`, `ASSERT_FALSE()`, etc.
- **Value comparisons**: `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_LT()`, `EXPECT_NEAR()`, etc.
- **String comparisons**: `EXPECT_STREQ()`, `ASSERT_STRCASEEQ()`, etc.
- **Exception assertions**: `EXPECT_THROW()`, `ASSERT_NO_THROW()`, etc.
- **Predicate assertions**: Custom Boolean conditions with rich failure messages.

You can find a detailed reference of these macros in the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md).

## Crafting Effective Custom Assertions

Sometimes, built-in macros don’t fully meet your needs. Writing custom assertions can improve the expressiveness and diagnostic quality of your tests.

### Using Predicate Assertions for Better Error Messages

When a condition involves complex logic or multiple values, a simple `EXPECT_TRUE()` may produce unhelpful failure messages because it only reports the Boolean result. GoogleTest supports predicate assertions that show the actual values involved.

There are three approaches:

#### 1. Use Existing Boolean Functions with `EXPECT_PRED*`
If you have a boolean function, e.g.,

```cpp
bool IsPositive(int n) { return n > 0; }
```
you can write:

```cpp
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, value);
```

Failure output will include the argument value, making it easier to debug.

#### 2. Use Functions Returning `AssertionResult` for Rich Messages

Rewrite your predicate to return an `AssertionResult` that customizes failure (and optionally success) messages.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
using ::testing::AssertionResult;
using ::testing::AssertionSuccess;
using ::testing::AssertionFailure;

AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0) {
    return AssertionSuccess() << n << " is even";
  } else {
    return AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
  }
}

// Usage
EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4)); // Succeeds silently
EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(3)); // Fails with message: "3 is odd"
```

This approach allows you to embed detailed messages explaining why the predicate failed or succeeded.

#### 3. Use Predicate-Formatter Assertions for Custom Formatting

If you need full control over message formatting, create a predicate-formatter function that receives stringized expressions and values, returning an `AssertionResult`. Use macros like `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`.

Example:

```cpp
AssertionResult IsInRange(const char* expr1, const char* expr2, int value, int low, int high) {
  if (value >= low && value <= high) {
    return AssertionSuccess();
  } else {
    return AssertionFailure() << expr1 << " with value " << value
                              << " outside range [" << low << ", " << high << "]";
  }
}

// Usage
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT3(IsInRange, x, 1, 10);
```

## Using Assertions Correctly

### Place Assertions in Appropriate Functions

- Use assertions in any C++ function. **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`) must be in `void`-returning functions only**, as GoogleTest disables exceptions and uses control flow to handle them.
- Avoid fatal assertions in constructors and destructors as they are not considered `void` functions by C++ standards.
- For functions returning non-`void`, use non-fatal assertions like `EXPECT_*` or convert your function to a `void` type and use an out-parameter.

### Adding Context with `SCOPED_TRACE`

When asserting in helper functions called multiple times (e.g., in loops), failures may be hard to trace back. Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information that is appended to failure messages.

Example:

```cpp
void CheckValue(int n) {
  EXPECT_GT(n, 0);
}

TEST(FooTest, CheckMultiple) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    SCOPED_TRACE(::testing::Message() << "Iteration: " << i);
    CheckValue(i);
  }
}
```

On failure, this prints which iteration caused the problem.

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- **Use `ASSERT_*` when failing further test execution is useless or dangerous**, e.g., checking that pointers are non-null before dereferencing.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions to report as many failures as possible**, increasing test feedback per run.
- Stream custom messages into assertions to improve diagnostics: 

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual) << "Failure details; expected " << expected << ", got " << actual;
```

- Avoid writing assertions with side effects or expensive operations in their argument lists since arguments are **always evaluated exactly once** but in undefined order.
- When catching assertion failures programmatically (e.g., in utilities), use `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE` and `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE` to test expected failure scenarios.

---

## Advanced Usage and Extensions

### Propagating Fatal Failures in Subroutines

Because fatal assertions abort only the current function, control returns to the caller, which may lead to unexpected behavior. To handle this:

- Use exception-based fatal failure propagation by adding a listener that throws an exception on fatal failures.
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` around subroutine calls to check that no fatal failures occurred inside.
- Use `HasFatalFailure()` in tests to prematurely return if a subroutine failed.

### Recording Additional Test Information

Use `RecordProperty("key", value)` to log extra key-value pairs as metadata, which are emitted in XML or JSON test reports. This is useful for recording test metrics or configuration details.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyTest, Metrics) {
  RecordProperty("ItemsProcessed", 42);
  ...
}
```

### Customizing How GoogleTest Prints Values

GoogleTest's default printer handles many standard types, but you can teach it to print your types better:

- Define a `friend` function template for `AbslStringify` within your class’ namespace:

```cpp
friend template <typename Sink>
void AbslStringify(Sink& sink, const MyType& value) {
  absl::Format(&sink, "MyType(value=%d)", value.val);
}
```

- Alternatively, define a `PrintTo()` function with an `ostream*` parameter.

If both are defined, `PrintTo()` will be used, allowing customized output in test logs without affecting your type’s streaming behavior elsewhere.

## Summary

This guide has equipped you with strategies to:

- Choose the appropriate assertion macros for your test's logic.
- Write predicate-based and predicate-formatter custom assertions for improved diagnostics.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to pinpoint failures in helper functions.
- Understand where and how to place assertions responsibly.
- Propagate fatal failures correctly from subroutines.
- Extend GoogleTest's value printing to your custom types.

By using these practices, you enhance not only the precision but also the clarity and maintainability of your tests.
