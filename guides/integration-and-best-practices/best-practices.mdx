# Best Practices for Reliable and Maintainable Tests

## Overview

This guide provides actionable recommendations for structuring your test code, managing naming conventions, organizing test data, and achieving a balance between test thoroughness and maintainability. Drawn from best practices at Google and popular open source projects, it aims to help you write tests that are robust, clear, easy to maintain, and effective at catching regressions.

## 1. Structuring Test Code

Organizing your test code logically and consistently fosters readability and maintainability across your testing suite.

### a. Group Tests by Feature or Behavior
- Arrange tests so related ones live together, reflecting functional areas or behaviors under test.
- Use test suite names and fixture classes that clearly indicate the feature or component tested.

### b. Keep Test Files Focused
- Prefer smaller test files targeting specific components or classes, rather than bloated monoliths.
- This makes it easier to navigate, understand, and run selective subsets of tests.

### c. Use Test Fixtures for Common Setup
- Share repeated setup and teardown code within test fixtures (using `TEST_F` or fixture classes).
- Fixtures reduce duplication and clarify the context of tests.

### d. Isolate Tests from Each Other
- Each test should be self-contained and independent to prevent test order dependencies.
- Use mocks and fakes (e.g., via GoogleMock) to isolate units and control external interactions.

<Tip>
Always structure tests around the **user-visible behavior** or **component contract** rather than implementation details, to make tests more stable against internal refactoring.
</Tip>

## 2. Naming Conventions

Clear and consistent naming conveys intent and facilitates fast diagnosis when tests fail.

### a. Name Tests Descriptively
- Use descriptive test and test suite names that explain what is being tested and under which conditions.
- For example: `TEST_F(AuthServiceTest, ReturnsErrorWhenPasswordIsInvalid)`

### b. Follow Consistent Naming Patterns
- Align test and mock naming with production code (e.g., `MockFoo` for mocking class `Foo`).
- Use verbs and conditions in test names to capture scenarios and expectations.

### c. Use Standard Mock Naming
- Prefix mock classes with `Mock` and place their declarations in dedicated headers as advised.
- This separates mock implementation from production code, easing maintenance.

<Note>
Avoid vague names like `Test1` or `FooTest` without explanation; use meaningful names to communicate the purpose clearly.
</Note>

## 3. Organizing Test Data

Test data should be easy to locate, update, and understand.

### a. Use Constants and Test Data Factories
- Define constants for fixed inputs and outputs used in tests.
- Implement helper functions or factory methods to create common or complex test objects.

### b. Store Large or Complex Data Separately
- Place big data blobs, JSON, or protobuf examples in separate files or fixtures that tests can load.
- This keeps test code clean and focused.

### c. Parameterize Tests for Coverage and Maintainability
- Leverage GoogleTest parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) to run the same test logic over multiple datasets.
- This reduces code duplication and improves coverage.

<Tip>
When test data formats evolve, isolating data in one place minimizes refactoring effort across tests.
</Tip>

## 4. Balancing Thoroughness and Maintainability

Effective tests catch bugs while being sustainable over time.

### a. Test What Matters
- Prioritize critical paths and business rules.
- Avoid testing trivial or implementation details that can change frequently.

### b. Avoid Over-Specification
- Use GoogleMock matchers to specify only relevant argument properties.
- When setting expectations, do not insist on exact calls or call counts unless necessary.

### c. Use ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL Judiciously
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default mock behaviors without imposing call expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify interactions explicitly.

### d. Use NiceMock and StrictMock Appropriately
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls during early or exploratory tests.
- Use `StrictMock` only when you want to disallow unplanned calls strictly.

### e. Refactor Tests Alongside Code
- When code changes, update tests to preserve their intent, simplifying or clarifying tests where possible.

<Warning>
Overly rigid tests cause brittle test suites that break for minor details; focus on behavior and intent instead.
</Warning>

## 5. Practical Advice and Code Patterns

### a. Mock Class Placement
- Define mocks in dedicated headers, preferably near or within the tested moduleâ€™s test directory.
- Avoid placing mocks directly in test source files if they need to be shared.

### b. Defining Mocks
- Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros in the public section regardless of the base method access level.
- Wrap complex return or argument types in parentheses or use type aliases to avoid macro parsing issues.

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foobar {
 public:
  // Wrap return type when it contains commas
  MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<int, bool>), GetPair, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, CheckMap, ((std::map<int, double>), bool), (override));
};
```

### c. Setting Mock Behaviors
- Use `ON_CALL` in fixture setup or constructor to define default behavior.
- Set precise expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` inside individual tests.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(5)).Times(1).WillOnce(Return(123));
```

### d. Use Sequences and Partial Orders for Ordered Calls
- Use `InSequence` to enforce call order when necessary.
- Use `After` and `Sequence` objects for more complex partial ordering constraints.

### e. Verifying and Resetting Mocks
- You can manually verify mocks earlier than destruction with:

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj));
```

- Avoid setting new expectations once verification has occurred.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### a. Missing Virtual Destructor
- Always ensure your interfaces and classes to be mocked have virtual destructors to avoid memory leaks and heap checker warnings.

### b. Overly Restrictive Expectations
- Tests fail because of unexpected call order or argument mismatches usually mean your expectations are too strict.
- Relax matching with wildcard `_` or more general matchers.

### c. Uninteresting Call Warnings
- You see warnings about uninteresting calls when methods are called without expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`). Use `Expect_Call(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for expected calls without strict count.

### d. Mock Method Signature Mismatches
- Carefully mock `const`, `noexcept`, reference qualified, or overloaded methods with proper qualifiers on `MOCK_METHOD`.

### e. Actions Exhausted Warnings
- If you supply fewer `WillOnce()` actions than calls, gMock warns. Add a `WillRepeatedly()` or increase `WillOnce()` calls.

## 7. Next Steps & Resources

- Explore the [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md) for deep API details on mocks, expectations, and clauses.
- Read the [gMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md) for a hands-on introduction.
- Leverage the [gMock Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md) for advanced recipes and patterns.
- Consult the [Getting Started Guides](guides/getting-started-workflows/) for sample workflows.

## Additional Notes

- The balance between thoroughness and maintainability is the key to successful testing. Striking this balance reduces brittle tests and maintenance workload.
- Understanding the implications of different mock behaviors (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, and default) helps manage test output noise versus strictness.

## Sample Code Snippet: Defining a Mock Class Safely

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}
  virtual int GetCount() const = 0;
  virtual void Process(int n) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetCount, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Process, (int n), (override));
};
```

Use parentheses or type aliases for complicated types with commas:

```cpp
using PairBoolInt = std::pair<bool, int>;
class MockBar {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD((PairBoolInt), GetResult, (), (override));
};
```

## Sample Code Snippet: Setting Expectations in a Test

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

TEST(MyTestSuite, ExampleTest) {
  MockFoo mock_foo;

  ON_CALL(mock_foo, GetCount()).WillByDefault(Return(5));

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Process(42)).Times(1);

  // Exercise code using mock_foo here
  int count = mock_foo.GetCount();
  mock_foo.Process(42);

  EXPECT_EQ(count, 5);
}
```

This shows how `ON_CALL` sets behavior, and `EXPECT_CALL` sets call expectation.
