# Integrating GoogleTest in Real-World Projects

## Overview

This guide provides practical patterns and best practices for embedding GoogleTest and GoogleMock into large-scale C++ development environments. It focuses on strategies to streamline continuous integration workflows, accommodate legacy codebases, manage collaboration among teams, and optimize test integration with build systems.

The guide assumes you are familiar with basic GoogleTest and GoogleMock usage. For newcomers, please review the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and [gMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md).

## 1. Planning Your Test Integration

### 1.1 Understanding Your Project Structure

Before adding tests, analyze your codebase to identify components needing verification. Common approaches include:

- Creating test suites aligned with existing modules or libraries.
- Using test fixtures to share setup/teardown code among related tests.
- Mocking dependencies where external resources are unavailable or slow.

### 1.2 Minimizing Impact on Production Code

GoogleTest and GoogleMock aim to be minimally invasive. When integrating:

- Prefer to keep test code separate from production code.
- Build mocks in test-only code rather than modifying production headers.
- Use interfaces and dependency injection to isolate components for easier mocking.

### 1.3 Organizing Tests for Scalability

Structure your tests into logically organized suites and directories:

- Group tests that share dependencies or test similar behavior.
- Use naming conventions that clearly link tests to functionality.
- Leverage parameterized and typed tests to avoid duplication.

---

## 2. Continuous Integration (CI) Integration

### 2.1 Automating Test Execution

Ensure your CI system runs GoogleTest binaries and collects useful reports:

- Configure your build system to compile and link tests automatically.
- Run `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in test binaries with `--gtest_output=xml:<file>` for machine-readable results.
- Gather XML reports for aggregation and visualization in CI dashboards.

### 2.2 Parallelizing Test Runs

To reduce overall runtime:

- Split tests into shards (subsets) using GoogleTest’s shard support with `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` environment variables.
- Run shards in parallel on different CI agents or machines.

### 2.3 Handling Flaky or Slow Tests

- Use `--gtest_repeat` to detect flaky tests by running them multiple times.
- Mark long-running tests with labels or use selective test running with `--gtest_filter`.
- Use `GTEST_FAIL_FAST` to stop CI early on failures if needed.

---

## 3. Working with Legacy Code

### 3.1 Introducing GoogleTest in Existing Projects

Gradually add tests to legacy projects to avoid disruption:

- Start by creating tests around critical interfaces.
- Introduce mocks for legacy dependencies to isolate test targets.
- Use *adapter* classes to wrap legacy code for easier testing.

### 3.2 Avoiding Breakage During Refactoring

- Keep tests focused on observable behavior rather than implementation details.
- Prefer using `ON_CALL` for default mock behavior and `EXPECT_CALL` only to verify essential interactions.
- Use `NiceMock` or `NaggyMock` for mocks to limit noise from uninteresting calls.

### 3.3 Refactoring Toward Testability

- Identify tightly coupled modules and introduce interfaces for seams.
- Gradually transition from concrete classes to interface-based designs.
- Use *delegation* techniques to combine real and mocked behaviors (see [Delegating Calls to a Fake](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#DelegatingToFake) and [Delegating Calls to a Real Object](docs/gmock_cook_book.md#DelegatingToFake)).

## 4. Collaboration and Team Practices

### 4.1 Standardizing Test and Mock Code

- Agree on coding styles and naming conventions for tests and mocks to improve readability.
- Use shared mock libraries when mocking third-party or shared components.
- Document expectations clearly to reduce ambiguity.

### 4.2 Reviewing and Maintaining Tests

- Code review test code with equal rigor as production code.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations that make tests brittle.
- Use tools and flags like `--gmock_verbose=info` to understand failed mock expectations.

### 4.3 Sharing Test Resources

- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to manage shared expensive resources across tests.
- Use `testing::Environment` for global setup and teardown.

---

## 5. Build System Integration

### 5.1 Adding GoogleTest and GoogleMock to Your Build

- Prefer using CMake support from the official GoogleTest project when possible.
- For Bazel builds, use the provided `cc_test` and `cc_library` rules with test deps on `@com_google_googletest`.
- For manual build systems, build GoogleTest/GoogleMock as libraries and link.

### 5.2 Organizing Test Binaries

- Group logically related tests into separate executables to make failures easier to isolate.
- Use consistent naming conventions for test executables.
- Integrate mocks within test targets and avoid polluting production binaries.

### 5.3 Setting Up Test Execution in IDEs

- Use GoogleTest’s built-in test discovery feature so IDEs can list and run tests individually.
- Configure IDE run configurations to pass command-line flags to tests for filtering and output formatting.

---

## 6. Practical Tips and Patterns

### 6.1 Handling Test Failures and Debugging

- Always check the exact call and expectation causing failure.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to failures in nested calls.
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed mock call traces.

### 6.2 Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- Set `EXPECT_CALL`s before exercising mocks to prevent undefined behavior.
- Avoid overly strict matching unless necessary to prevent brittle tests.
- Do not mock private methods directly; mock via the public interface.

### 6.3 Advanced Mocking Patterns

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls during development.
- Use `StrictMock` only when you want errors for any unanticipated interactions.
- Delegate calls to real or fake objects to combine default behavior with expectation verification.

## 7. Summary and Next Steps

You have seen how to integrate GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively within real-world, large-scale C++ projects. Focus on planning, smooth CI integration, and team collaboration to get the most from the framework.

For detailed reference and advanced techniques, consider reviewing:

- [GoogleTest Primer](docs/primer.md)
- [GoogleMock Cookbook](docs/gmock_cook_book.md)
- [Writing Effective Assertions](guides/integration-and-best-practices/writing-effective-assertions)
- [Advanced Testing Strategies](guides/advanced-testing-strategies/parameterized-and-typed-tests)

Leveraging these will help your team build robust, maintainable tests quickly.

## Appendix: Useful Code Snippet

### Example: Setting up a Somewhat Representative Test Suite with Mocks

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::_;         // Wildcard matcher
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::NiceMock;

class MyInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~MyInterface() {}
  virtual int Compute(int x) = 0;
  virtual void Reset() = 0;
};

class MockMyInterface : public MyInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int x), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Reset, (), (override));
};

TEST(ExampleTest, UsesMock) {
  NiceMock<MockMyInterface> mock;

  // Default behavior: Compute returns 42
  ON_CALL(mock, Compute(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(10))
      .Times(2)
      .WillRepeatedly(Return(100));

  mock.Reset(); // No expectations, fine, because using NiceMock

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(10), 100); // First call
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(10), 100); // Second call
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(20), 42);  // Uses default behavior
}
```

This example highlights:

- The use of `ON_CALL` for default behavior.
- The use of `EXPECT_CALL` for specific expectations with cardinality.
- Use of `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
