# Migrating Existing Projects to GoogleTest

A pragmatic guide for transitioning legacy tests and existing projects to GoogleTest, including stepwise migration, advanced configuration tips, and troubleshooting common issues.

---

## 1. Introduction

Migrating an existing codebase or legacy test suite to GoogleTest can streamline your testing workflow and bring the power of GoogleTest's expressive assertions and flexible mocking capabilities to your project. This guide walks you through a practical, step-by-step approach to migrate your tests efficiently while minimizing disruption.


## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have:
- A working GoogleTest setup integrated into your build system (CMake, Bazel, or other).
- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest concepts, including test cases, fixtures, and assertions.
- Access to your legacy test source code and build scripts.


## 3. Migration Workflow

The migration is best approached incrementally, migrating tests module by module or component by component.

<Steps>
<Step title="Analyze Existing Tests">
Review your current tests to understand:
- The test frameworks or idioms currently in use.
- Testing styles: unit, integration, system.
- Dependencies on external resources (databases, files, network).

This helps you prioritize which tests to migrate first and estimate effort.
</Step>
<Step title="Set Up GoogleTest in Your Project">
Integrate GoogleTest into your build system if not done yet.

Refer to:
- [Installation with CMake](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/installation.md#building-and-installation)
- [Integration with Bazel](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md)

Make sure simple sample tests pass before proceeding.
</Step>
<Step title="Convert Test Files Incrementally">
Start with a small, self-contained set of tests.

- Rename legacy test files if necessary.
- Replace legacy test macros with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` GoogleTest macros.
- Reimplement legacy assertions using GoogleTest's rich assertion macros (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`).
- For tests involving mocks, leverage GoogleMock facilities as shown in the [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html).
</Step>
<Step title="Refactor for Test Fixtures and Mocks">
Where test setup and teardown logic exist, convert them into GoogleTest fixtures (`TEST_F`).

If your tests involve dependencies to external systems or complex collaborations, consider mocking them using GoogleMock.

Note:
- Mock classes should have virtual destructors.
- Define mock classes close to the source interfaces you own.
</Step>
<Step title="Run and Validate Tests">
Run migrated tests to verify correctness.

- Confirm that all tests pass.
- Fix any failures caused by migration changes.
- Use GoogleTest's output and verbose flag `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed diagnostics on mock failures.
</Step>
<Step title="Expand Migration Coverage">
Iterate over remaining tests and migrate them using the same approach.

- Prioritize critical or frequently modified modules.
- Automate builds and runs in CI to catch regressions early.

</Step>
<Step title="Cleanup and Optimize">
Once all tests are migrated:

- Remove legacy test framework dependencies.
- Optimize mocks, using `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` to control warning verbosity.
- Refactor tests to simplify overly complex mocks or brittle expectations.
- Leverage GoogleTestâ€™s advanced capabilities such as parameterized tests.

</Step>
</Steps>


## 4. Advanced Configuration Tips

- **Avoid Over-Specification:** Restrict expectations to what is necessary to prevent brittle tests. Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only for interactions you want to verify.
- **Order Control:** Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to enforce call order if your tests rely on strict invocation sequences.
- **Returning Move-Only Types:** Use lambdas in actions when mocking functions with move-only arguments or return values (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`).
- **Delegating Mocks to Fake or Real Objects:** When needed, delegate default mock methods to existing fake or real implementations to reduce duplication and preserve behavior consistency.
- **Using Nice and Strict Mocks:** Control test verbosity by selecting the right mock strictness. Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, and `StrictMock` to treat unexpected calls as errors.


## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Migration Issues">
<Accordion title="Mock Methods Call Real Implementations Instead of Being Mocked">
Ensure that methods you are mocking are declared `virtual` in the base interface or class.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compiler Errors on MOCK_METHOD with Const or Complex Arguments">
See the [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html#MOCK_METHOD) for proper macro usage, especially wrapping types with commas in extra parentheses or using type aliases.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Failures Caused by Expectation Not Met">
Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed traces of mock calls and expectations. Fix order or argument mismatches in your expectations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Heapcheck Failures When Using Mock Objects">
Verify that all mocked interfaces have virtual destructors. Missing virtual destructors can cause memory leaks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Uninteresting Call Warnings">
Add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` or wrap your mocks with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings if those calls are expected but unverified.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## 6. Practical Code Examples

### Simple Legacy Test Conversion

Legacy test snippet:

```cpp
// LegacyTest.cpp
void test_addition() {
  assert(add(2, 3) == 5);
}
```

Migrated to GoogleTest:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(add(2, 3), 5);
}
```

### Migrating to GoogleMock

Legacy interface:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
};
```

Define mock:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};
```

Example usage in test:

```cpp
using ::testing::AtLeast;

TEST(PaintTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(10));

  // Exercise code using turtle...
}
```


## 7. Migration Best Practices

- **Migrate Gradually:** Avoid a big-bang migration. Validate and integrate each migrated test before moving on.
- **Encapsulate Mocks:** Define mocks close to the real interfaces you own to centralize maintenance.
- **Use Namespaces:** Import GoogleTest and GoogleMock symbols judiciously to keep code readable.
- **Avoid Overly Strict Expectations:** Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to prevent tests from failing due to extra calls out of your interest.
- **Use Continuous Integration:** Set up automated runs to catch migration regressions early.


## 8. Next Steps

After completing migration:

- Explore writing advanced parameterized and typed tests.
- Leverage [GoogleMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.md) for complex mocking scenarios.
- Integrate GoogleTest runs into CI pipelines using [Continuous Integration and Test Automation guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/ci-cd-practices.md).
- Learn about controlling mock strictness in [mock-strictness guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/guides/best-practices-and-patterns/mock-strictness.md).
