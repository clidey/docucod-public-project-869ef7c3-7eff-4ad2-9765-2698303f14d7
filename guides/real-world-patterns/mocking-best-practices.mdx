# Mocking Best Practices

GoogleMock (gMock) offers powerful capabilities to isolate dependencies in your C++ tests by creating mock objects with fine-grained control. This guide helps you apply effective mocking patterns, avoid common pitfalls, and adopt recommended strategies using GoogleMock's features such as `StrictMock`, `NiceMock`, and `NaggyMock`.

---

## 1. Understanding the Role of Mocking in Tests

Before diving into code, it’s essential to understand why and when to mock:

- **Isolate dependencies**: Mocks enable tests that focus solely on the behavior of the code under test without relying on complex or slow external resources.
- **Verify interactions**: Use mocks to ensure your code invokes its collaborators as expected — with correct parameters, ordering, and frequency.
- **Avoid brittleness**: Proper mocking prevents tightly coupled tests that break upon minor refactoring.

Adopting best practices will help you write mocks that are maintainable, expressive, and robust.

---

## 2. Choosing the Right Mock Type: StrictMock, NiceMock, NaggyMock

GoogleMock supports three variations of mock strictness via `StrictMock`, `NiceMock`, and `NaggyMock`. Choosing the appropriate one balances noise, maintenance effort, and test strictness.

| Mock Type   | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls (Calls with no expectations)                                                  | When to Use                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NaggyMock` | Prints warnings on uninteresting calls (Default for mock objects).                                             | Use for debugging during development; detects unexpected calls. |
| `NiceMock`  | Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, allowing them silently.                                           | Use for well-tested code or when uninteresting calls are safe.  |
| `StrictMock`| Treats all uninteresting calls as test failures, enforcing strict expectations on all mock methods called.   | Use when you want to ensure every mocked call is expected.      |


### How to use:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StrictMock;
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;

class MockFoo { 
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoThis, (), ());
};

// Strict mock - all uninteresting calls are errors
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;

// Nice mock - ignores uninteresting calls
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;

// Naggy mock - warns on uninteresting calls
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_foo;
```

### Best Practice:

- By default, prefer using `NiceMock` to avoid noise from uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock` only when you want to enforce all interaction expectations strictly.
- Use `NaggyMock` when you want warnings to detect unexpected calls during test development.

<Note>
`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` only affect *uninteresting* calls - calls to mock methods with no expectations. They do not affect *unexpected* calls, i.e., calls that match no specific `EXPECT_CALL`. Unexpected calls always cause failures.
</Note>

## 3. Defining Expectations and Avoiding Overly Fragile Tests

### 3.1 Prefer `ON_CALL` for Behavior Setup and `EXPECT_CALL` for Verification

- Use `ON_CALL` to define the default behavior of mock methods without asserting the call is required.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to specify calls you want to verify happen with specific arguments and counts.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;

MockFoo foo;

// Setup default action for GetValue()
ON_CALL(foo, GetValue()).WillByDefault(Return(0));

// Expect that DoSomething() is called exactly once
EXPECT_CALL(foo, DoSomething());

foo.DoSomething();  // Verified
int val = foo.GetValue();  // Uses ON_CALL default behavior
```

### 3.2 Avoid Excessive or Redundant `EXPECT_CALL`s

- Do not add `EXPECT_CALL` for every method call unless you want to verify it specifically.
- Adding too many expectations makes tests brittle and prone to break on unrelated changes.
- Suppress warnings on uninteresting calls with `NiceMock` or `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` cautiously.

<Warning>
Avoid suppressing uninteresting call warnings by blindly setting `EXPECT_CALL` without specifying intentions. This leads to maintenance headaches.
</Warning>

### 3.3 Use Wildcard Matchers Appropriately

Use `_` matcher to indicate arguments you don't care about. This reduces fragile specifications.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Process(_));  // Any argument is fine
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Lookup(Ge(0)));  // Restricts to argument >= 0
```

---

## 4. Ordering Expectations: Sequences and Partial Orders

### 4.1 Enforce Order with `InSequence`

Wrap `EXPECT_CALL` statements within an `InSequence` block to require calls in declaration order.

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step3());
}
```

The mock verifies Step1, then Step2, then Step3 are called in that exact order.

### 4.2 Define Partial Ordering with `InSequence` Clause on Expectations

You can declare sequences explicitly and assign expectations to multiple sequences to define partial ordering.

```cpp
using ::testing::Sequence;
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Finish()).InSequence(s2);
```

The call graph enforced:

- Init must come before Process
- Init must come before Finish
- Process and Finish can occur in any order after Init

### 4.3 Use `.After()` for Fine-Grained Control

Alternatively, use `After()` clause with `Expectation` and `ExpectationSet` to express complex DAG orderings between expectations.

```cpp
using ::testing::Expectation;
Expectation e1 = EXPECT_CALL(foo, Start());
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Stop()).After(e1);
```

## 5. Avoiding Common Mocking Anti-Patterns

### 5.1 Over-specifying Expectations

Setting expectations for every method call or argument value is fragile. Tests break easily when implementation changes without contract violations.

### 5.2 Ignoring Uninteresting Calls Without Thought

Suppressing warnings via `NiceMock` without verifying critical calls can hide real problems.

### 5.3 Misusing `RetiresOnSaturation`

Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` when you want an expectation to stop matching after it reaches its call limit, to prevent sticky expectations causing failures on extra calls.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(5)).Times(2).RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

### 5.4 Forgetting Virtual Destructors

Always ensure interfaces you mock have virtual destructors to avoid undefined behavior and leaks.

### 5.5 Mocking Concrete Classes Instead of Interfaces

Prefer coding to interfaces. Mocking concrete classes increases coupling and maintenance burden.

---

## 6. Delegation Patterns for Mocking

### 6.1 Delegating to a Fake Implementation

Sometimes you have a fake class with realish behavior. Mock default behavior can delegate calls to that fake.

```cpp
ON_CALL(*this, Foo(_)).WillByDefault([this](int x) { return fake_.Foo(x); });
```

### 6.2 Delegating to a Real Object

Useful to ensure mock behaves identically to real objects while still verifying interactions.

---

## 7. Tips for Managing Mock Complexity

- Move heavy mock class constructor/destructor definitions to `.cc` files for faster compilation.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` to force verification before destruction.
- Use proper mock strictness level to balance test strictness vs noise.
- Use descriptive names and comments on expectations.
- Use sequences or `After()` clauses to clarify ordering.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Uninteresting Function Call Warning

*Cause:* Mock method is called but has no `EXPECT_CALL`.

*Solution:* Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings if calls are safe or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` cautiously.

### Problem: Unexpected Call Failure

*Cause:* Call doesn't match any `EXPECT_CALL`.

*Solution:* Add appropriate expectations or adjust matchers.

### Problem: Too Many or Too Few Calls

*Cause:* Call counts violate the cardinality set with `Times()`.

*Solution:* Review call counts, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or relax expectations.

### Problem: Overloaded Methods Ambiguity

*Cause:* Mocking overloaded methods confuses the compiler.

*Solution:* Use `Const()` wrapper for const overloads and explicit matcher casts to disambiguate.

### Problem: Virtual Destructor Missing

*Cause:* No virtual destructor in base class leading to leaks.

*Solution:* Add virtual destructor to all interfaces.

## 9. Summary

Adopting these mocking best practices will help you isolate dependencies effectively, write maintainable tests, and catch bugs early by verifying important interactions. Balance strictness with flexibility using `StrictMock`, `NiceMock`, and `NaggyMock`. Define clear expectations, avoid over-specification, use ordering controls where required, and delegate to fakes or real objects when helpful.

# Appendix: Example Usage of StrictMock, NiceMock, and NaggyMock

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StrictMock;
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string&), ());
};

void TestFunction(MockDatabase& db) {
  db.Connect();
  db.Query("SELECT 1");
}

// Example tests:

TEST(DatabaseTest, UsingStrictMock) {
  StrictMock<MockDatabase> db;
  EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect());  // Must be called.
  EXPECT_CALL(db, Query(_));   // Must be called with any string.

  TestFunction(db);
  // Any calls other than these cause test failure.
}

TEST(DatabaseTest, UsingNiceMock) {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> db;
  EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect()).WillRepeatedly(Return(true));

  TestFunction(db);
  // Uninteresting calls produce no warnings.
}

TEST(DatabaseTest, UsingNaggyMock) {
  NaggyMock<MockDatabase> db;
  EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect()).WillOnce(Return(true));

  TestFunction(db);
  // Uninteresting calls print warnings.
}
```


<Tip>
Use `NiceMock` as the default mock type to reduce noise and improve test maintenance.
Switch to `StrictMock` to enforce stricter call validations during later stages or critical modules.
