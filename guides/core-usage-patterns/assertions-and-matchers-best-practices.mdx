# Writing Effective Assertions and Using Matchers

This guide empowers you to write clear, expressive, and robust expectations in your tests by leveraging the full spectrum of assertion macros and advanced matcher techniques in GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
You will learn how to:
- Use assertion macros effectively to verify conditions and behaviors in your code.
- Employ matchers to write expressive and flexible expectations.
- Write assertions that produce meaningful failure messages for faster debugging.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with C++.
- Understanding of unit testing concepts.
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed and integrated into your development environment.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this guide, you will be able to craft assertions that precisely and clearly validate your program's behavior, making tests easier to write, maintain, and debug.

### Time Estimate
15-30 minutes to absorb examples and apply learnings.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Basics of Assertion Macros

GoogleTest provides two types of assertion macros with similar names:
- `EXPECT_*`: Non-fatal assertions that record failures but allow the test to continue.
- `ASSERT_*`: Fatal assertions that abort the current function immediately upon failure.

### Examples of Basic Assertions
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2);   // Checks val1 == val2
ASSERT_TRUE(condition);   // Checks condition is true, aborts if not
EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2); // Checks C-string equality
```

You can always append custom failure messages using streaming:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(result) << "Result was false, expected true.";
```

### When to Use ASSERT_ vs EXPECT_
Use `ASSERT_` when subsequent test code depends on the assertion being true (e.g., preventing dereferencing a null pointer). Use `EXPECT_` for assertions that allow the test to reveal multiple failures in one run.

---

## 3. Introducing Matchers for Expressive Assertions

Matchers allow for more nuanced and readable assertion expressions. They are used extensively in conjunction with the `EXPECT_THAT` and `ASSERT_THAT` macros, as well as with mock expectations via `EXPECT_CALL`.

### Using EXPECT_THAT
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;
using ::testing::AllOf;

EXPECT_THAT(value1, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(value2, MatchesRegex("Line \d+"));
ASSERT_THAT(value3, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
```
This writes natural language expectations and produces insightful failure messages.

### Wildcard and Generic Comparison Matchers
- `_` matches any value of the correct type.
- `Eq(value)`, `Ne(value)`, `Gt(value)`, etc., for equality and relational comparisons.

### String Matchers
- `HasSubstr(substring)`: Checks if a string contains a substring.
- `StartsWith(prefix)`, `EndsWith(suffix)`: Match string prefixes or suffixes.
- `MatchesRegex(pattern)`: Match against a regular expression.

### Container and Member Matchers
- `ElementsAre(...)` and variants for container contents.
- `Field(&Class::member, matcher)`: Match a specific member field.
- `Property(&Class::method, matcher)`: Match a property accessed via a getter method.

## 4. Writing Robust and Meaningful Assertions

### Using AssertionResult for Custom Predicates
Instead of directly returning `bool`, writing predicates that return `::testing::AssertionResult` lets you customize failure messages.

Example:
```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(x));
```
Failure will output:
```
Value of: IsEven(x)
  Actual: false (3 is odd)
Expected: true
```

### Using Predicate-Formatter Assertions
When the default messages from `EXPECT_PRED*` macros are not enough, you can write predicate-formatters to customize error output fully (see [`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`](reference/assertions.md#EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT)).

### Combining Matchers
Advanced matchers like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` enable logical composition:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Ge(5), Le(10)));
EXPECT_THAT(value, Not(Eq(7)));
```

### Matching Multiple Arguments as a Group
Use `.With()` on expectations to match multiple method arguments as a tuple. Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_, _))
    .With(Lt()); // The first argument is less than the second.
```

## 5. Best Practices for Using Assertions and Matchers

- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for clear and informative assertions.
- Write custom matchers with the `MATCHER` family of macros for reusable validation logic.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information when assertions fail inside helper functions or loops.
- Prefer built-in matchers and combine them rather than crafting complex logic inside a single matcher.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations in mocks to keep tests resilient and maintainable.

---

## 6. Advanced Matcher Usage

### Casting and Selecting Overloads
- Use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(matcher)` to relax type restrictions safely when mock methods are overloaded.
- Use specialized matchers like `TypedEq<T>(value)` to disambiguate overloaded functions in `EXPECT_CALL`.

### Validating Pointer Arguments
- Use `Pointee(matcher)` to validate the pointed-to value of pointer parameters.
- Use nested `Pointee()` for pointers to pointers.

### Matching Containers and Maps
- Use `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()` to match sequence contents.
- Use `Pair(key_matcher, value_matcher)` for associative container checks.

### Defining Custom Matchers
- Use `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, etc., to quickly write custom matchers with descriptive messages.
- Implement matcher classes directly for full control when needed.

### Using Matchers in Assertions and Mock Expectations
- Use matchers in `EXPECT_THAT`, `ASSERT_THAT`, and in mock `EXPECT_CALL` for argument validation.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

### Assertions Not Failing as Expected
- Ensure that `ASSERT_*` macros are used for conditions that should abort the test on failure.
- Remember `EXPECT_*` macros allow tests to continue even after a failure.

### Matching Argument Types
- Use the correct matchers to match specific types.
- Use explicit casting when mocking overloaded mock methods.

### Avoiding Unintended Side Effects
- Matchers must be pure functionsâ€”avoid matchers that cause state changes or depend on external state.

### Using `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`
- Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior without setting expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to enforce that a call happens.

### Suppressing Uninteresting Call Warnings
- Wrap mocks with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings about calls without expectations.
- Alternatively, use `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to ignore specific calls.

## 8. Code Examples

### Basic Assertion with Matcher
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StartsWith;

TEST(ExampleTest, HasPrefix) {
  std::string greeting = "Hello, World!";
  EXPECT_THAT(greeting, StartsWith("Hello"));
}
```

### Custom Predicate with AssertionResult
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

testing::AssertionResult IsPositive(int n) {
  if (n > 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not positive";
}

TEST(ExampleTest, PositiveCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPositive(5)); // Passes.
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPositive(-1)); // Fails with message.
}
```

### Matcher in EXPECT_CALL
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Bar, (int), ());
};

using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Gt;

TEST(MockTest, ExpectCallWithMatcher) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(Gt(10)))
      .WillOnce(testing::Return(true));

  EXPECT_TRUE(mock.Bar(15));
}
```

### Combining Matchers
```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Ge;
using ::testing::Le;

EXPECT_THAT(7, AllOf(Ge(5), Le(10))); // Checks that 7 is between 5 and 10 inclusive.
```

<Tip>
Remember to match your assertions and expectations carefully to your testing intent. Use matchers for expressive, readable validations, and avoid over-constraining tests which can make maintenance difficult.
