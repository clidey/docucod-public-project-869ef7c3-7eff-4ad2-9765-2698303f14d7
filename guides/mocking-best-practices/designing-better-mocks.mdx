# Designing Clean and Maintainable Mocks

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you design mock objects in GoogleMock that are clean, maintainable, and robust. It focuses on structuring mock classes effectively, choosing the appropriate mock strictness (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`), and avoiding common pitfalls that cause brittle or slow tests.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with GoogleMock basics, including `MOCK_METHOD`, `ON_CALL`, and `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Understanding of C++ virtual methods and test fixtures.
- Access to your test code and ability to modify mock class definitions.

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this guide, you will be able to:
- Create mocks that are easier to read and maintain.
- Select the correct strictness wrapper (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`) based on test intent.
- Write expectations and default actions that do not lead to brittle or verbose tests.
- Implement advanced techniques like method delegation to real or fake objects.
- Use sequences and ordering to control call expectations clearly.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30-45 minutes for initial reading and application; mastering the concepts may take longer as you integrate into your tests.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Guide to Designing Maintainable Mocks

### 1. Define Your Mock Class Clearly

- Derive a mock class from your interface or base class.
- Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to mock each virtual function you will interact with in tests.
- Always place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public:` section, even when mocking `protected` or `private` methods.

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, DoWork, (int input), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Reset, (), (override));
};
```

- For overloaded methods, mock all variants you intend to use; otherwise, consider using `using Base::Method;` to bring others into scope.

### 2. Choose the Appropriate Mock Strictness Wrapper

GoogleMock provides wrappers that control how uninteresting calls (those without explicit expectations) are handled:

- `NiceMock<T>`: suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock<T>` (default): warns on uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock<T>`: treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

**Best Practices:**

- Use **`NiceMock`** as the default in most tests. It keeps logs clean while still verifying expected calls.
- Use **`NaggyMock`** during test development or debugging if you want to see warnings about unexpected calls.
- Use **`StrictMock`** sparingly when you want to enforce no unexpected or uninteresting calls are made.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoWork(42));
```

<Tip>
Avoid nesting different mock strictnesses (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<T>>`) as itâ€™s unsupported.
</Tip>

### 3. Set Default Actions with ON_CALL to Avoid Over-Specification

- Use `ON_CALL(mock, Method(args))` to specify default behavior without asserting the method will be called.
- Avoid unnecessary `EXPECT_CALL` statements for methods that are not relevant to the behavior you are testing.

Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

- This setup prevents spurious warnings about uninteresting calls.

### 4. Use EXPECT_CALL Sparingly and Precisely

- Reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for interactions you *must* verify.
- Set specific matchers only for parameters relevant to your test intent, use `_` to ignore others.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, ProcessData(_, 100));  // Only cares the 2nd arg is 100
```

- Use cardinalities (`Times()`) wisely. If omitted, GoogleMock infers it based on actions.

<Tip>
Remember, overusing `EXPECT_CALL` makes tests brittle and hard to maintain.
</Tip>

### 5. Arrange Expectations for Calls Order When Needed

- To enforce strict order of expected calls, wrap your `EXPECT_CALL`s with an `InSequence` object.

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

- For partial orders, use `.After()` or `.InSequence()` with multiple `Sequence` objects.

### 6. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for Sticky Expectations

- By default, expectations are sticky; after the allowed number of calls they remain active, potentially causing errors on further calls.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire an expectation immediately when saturated, helping to avoid this.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

### 7. Delegate to Fakes or Real Objects When Appropriate

When existing implementations exist (either a fake or the real class), you can delegate mock behavior to them:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int), (override));

  void DelegateToFake() {
    ON_CALL(*this, Compute).WillByDefault([this](int x) {
      return fake_.Compute(x);
    });
  }

 private:
  FakeFoo fake_;
};
```

Use delegation to avoid duplicate logic and reduce test maintenance.

### 8. Prefer Simplified Mock Interfaces Over Complex Ones

- For methods with many arguments (some uninteresting), consider writing a wrapper method with fewer or simpler parameters that delegates to the original method, and mock the simplified one.

### 9. Handling Move-Only Types

- `MOCK_METHOD` supports move-only types for arguments and return values.
- Set expectations using lambdas or `WillOnce`/`WillRepeatedly` with appropriate lambdas when needed.

### 10. Optimize Compilation Speed

- For very large mock classes, declare mock constructors and destructors in headers but define them once in `.cc` files to improve compilation times.

## Examples & Patterns

### Basic Mock Class with Strictness Wrap

```cpp
class MockDatabase : public Database {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Disconnect, (), (override));
};

using ::testing::NiceMock;

NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;

ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect).WillByDefault(Return(true));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Disconnect()).Times(1);
```

### Ordered Calls with Sequences

```cpp
Sequence s;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("primary_server")).InSequence(s);
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Disconnect()).InSequence(s);
```

### Delegation to Real Object

```cpp
class MockLogger : public Logger {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Log, (const std::string& message), (override));
  MockLogger() {
    ON_CALL(*this, Log).WillByDefault([this](const std::string& msg) {
      real_logger_.Log(msg);
    });
  }
 private:
  Logger real_logger_;
};
```

### Retiring Expectations Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetData())
    .WillOnce(Return(10))
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetData())
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(20));
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Uninteresting Calls:** Warnings show when methods without expectations are called. Use `NiceMock` or `ON_CALL` to suppress.
- **Unexpected Calls:** Calls that do not match any `EXPECT_CALL` are errors. Make sure all critical calls have expectations.
- **Order Violations:** If tests fail due to call order, use `InSequence` or design partial orders with `After`.
- **Sticky Expectations:** If `EXPECT_CALL` fails because the call count exceeded, consider adding `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.
- **Mock Destruction:** If mocks live beyond test scope, use `Mock::AllowLeak()` cautiously to prevent false negatives.
- **Slow Compilation:** Isolate mock class definitions to headers and define constructors/destructors in single `.cc` files.
- **Delegation Pitfalls:** Delegating to real objects keeps behavior consistent but can hide unexpected calls; ensure coverage with explicit expectations.

<Tip>
Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed logs of mock calls and expectation matches; it aids debugging.
