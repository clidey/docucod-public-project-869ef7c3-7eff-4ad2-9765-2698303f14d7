# Building Maintainable, Scalable Test Suites

## Introduction

Writing tests that scale effectively as your codebase grows is essential to maintaining a high-quality software project. This page guides you through practical strategies to organize your tests, manage shared resources efficiently, minimize flakiness, and write clear, intent-revealing assertions and mocks. By applying these proven techniques, you ensure your test suites remain clean, maintainable, and fast, helping you confidently evolve your code.

---

## 1. Organizing Your Tests

### Group Tests Logically

- **Use Test Suites to Reflect Code Structure**: Create test suites that group related tests, aligning the test suite name with the code class or module under test. This makes it easier to locate tests and understand coverage.

- **Prefer Descriptive Test Names Without Underscores**: Follow idiomatic GoogleTest naming conventions by avoiding underscores in test suite and test names. This ensures compatibility and prevents unexpected naming conflicts.

- **Use TEST and TEST_F Macros Appropriately**: Use `TEST()` for simple independent tests and `TEST_F()` when tests share a fixture (common setup/teardown or member objects).

### Organize Tests To Minimize Dependencies and Side Effects

- Tests must be independent so they can run in isolation and in any order.

- Avoid using mutable global or static variables that affect test outcomes.

- Clean up side effects properly to prevent cascading failures.

### Use Test Fixtures for Shared Setup

- Define a test fixture class inheriting from `testing::Test`.

- Initialize common objects/resources in the constructor or `SetUp()`.

- Clean up in destructor or `TearDown()`.

- Create fresh fixture instances per test to avoid cross-test contamination.

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  FooTest() { /* init */ }
  void SetUp() override { /* per-test setup */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* per-test cleanup */ }
  ~FooTest() override { /* cleanup */ }

  SomeClass common_resource_;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, DoesSomething) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(common_resource_.DoIt());
}
```

> **Tip:** Always use `override` for `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` to catch typos.

---

## 2. Managing Shared Resources Efficiently

### Use Per-Test-Suite Setup and Teardown

- Place expensive resource initialization in `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and cleanup in `static void TearDownTestSuite()` inside your fixture class.

- GoogleTest invokes these methods once per test suite around the first and last tests respectively.

- This keeps tests fast and avoids expensive setup costs for each test.

```cpp
class BarTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static DatabaseConnection* db_;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_ = new DatabaseConnection("connection_string");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete db_;
    db_ = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Reset state if required
  }
};

DatabaseConnection* BarTest::db_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(BarTest, QueryReturnsExpected) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_->Query("SELECT * FROM foo"));
}
```

<Warning>
Be sure that shared resources are thread-safe if tests run in parallel, or serialize access appropriately.
</Warning>

### Avoid Leaking Resources in SetUpTestSuite

- If your test suite has subclasses, `SetUpTestSuite()` may be called multiple times.

- Guard initialization code to prevent double allocation and corresponding memory leaks.

### Use Global Environments for Cross-Test-Program Setup

- For setup that spans multiple test suites or the entire test program, subclass `::testing::Environment`.

- Register with `::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` to manage global state.

```cpp
class MyEnvironment : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    InitializeSharedResources();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    CleanupSharedResources();
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnvironment());
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## 3. Reducing Test Flakiness

Flaky tests undermine trust in your test suite. To avoid them:

- **Avoid Global Mutable State**: Don't share mutable variables between tests without proper synchronization.

- **Use Fresh Test Fixtures**: GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance per test.

- **Avoid Dependencies on External Resources**: Use mocks or test doubles to isolate the unit under test.

- **Control Randomness and Timing**: Seed random number generators consistently; avoid tests dependent on timing unless specifically testing behavior under timing constraints.

- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to Aid Debugging**: When a failure happens deep in helper functions or loops, use `SCOPED_TRACE` with contextual info to understand which invocation caused it.

```cpp
void Helper(int n) {
  SCOPED_TRACE(testing::Message() << "Helper called with n=" << n);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), SomeExpectedValue(n));
}

TEST(FactorialTest, VariousInputs) {
  for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    Helper(i);
  }
}
```

- **Limit Use of Fatal Assertions in Helper Functions**: Fatal failures abort the current function only, not the whole testâ€”use `HasFatalFailure()` to detect and handle them if needed.

## 4. Writing Clear, Intent-Revealing Assertions

### Choose the Right Assertion Macros

- Use `EXPECT_*` macros when you want test execution to continue after failure to gather multiple errors.

- Use `ASSERT_*` macros when further code depends on the assertion being true (e.g., dereferencing pointers).

- Stream additional messages with `<<` for clarity.

```cpp
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Failed to allocate buffer";
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Processing result mismatch";
```

### Use Specialized Assertions for Better Diagnostics

- Use typed assertions such as `EXPECT_STREQ` for C strings, `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` for floats, and `EXPECT_THROW` for exception expectations.

- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers from GoogleMock for expressive assertions.

### Compose Custom Assertions for Complex Logic

- Define predicate assertions returning `testing::AssertionResult` with detailed messages.

- Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` variants for predicate formatters that provide custom assertion messages.

---

## 5. Using Mocks to Clarify Test Intent

- Use GoogleMock mocks to isolate dependencies, control interactions, and verify behavior.

- Define mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` for the interfaces you depend on.

- Set expectations using `EXPECT_CALL` with matching argument matchers.

- Specify behavior via `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, or `.WillByDefault()`.

- Control strictness levels with `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` to manage noise or enforce strictness.

Example:

```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string&), ());
};

TEST(DatabaseClientTest, ReturnsValue) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillOnce(testing::Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query("SELECT 1")).WillOnce(testing::Return(42));

  DatabaseClient client(&mock_db);
  EXPECT_EQ(client.GetAnswer(), 42);
}
```

## 6. Best Practices Summary

- Keep tests **independent**, **repeatable**, and **fast**.
- Group them into logical suites aligned to the application structure.
- Use fixtures for shared setup and clearly separate shared state using `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`.
- Apply `SCOPED_TRACE` for better debugging context.
- Prefer non-fatal assertions `EXPECT_*` to reveal multiple failures, escalate to `ASSERT_*` if subsequent code depends on passed assertions.
- Use mocks to isolate units and precisely express intent.
- Avoid creating flakiness by controlling environment, state, and randomness.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Tests Fail Indeterminately**: Check for shared mutable state or external dependencies. Use fixtures properly.

- **Unexpected Test Name Collisions**: Avoid underscore `_` in test suite and test names.

- **Memory Leaks in Fixtures**: Properly clean up in `TearDown` and `TearDownTestSuite`.

- **Assertion Macros in Constructors or Destructors**: Not allowed for fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`). Use `SetUp()` / `TearDown()` instead.

- **Death Tests Hangs or Fails**: Run death tests isolated; avoid multi-threading outside death test scopes.

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize expensive setup by using `SetUpTestSuite()`.

- Use mock objects to avoid costly real dependencies.

- Use parameterized tests to cover more scenarios with less duplicated code.

### Alternative Approaches

- Use **Typed Tests** and **Type-Parameterized Tests** for verifying behavior across multiple types with shared logic (see related documentation).

- Use **Value-Parameterized Tests** (`TEST_P`) to run the same test over different inputs without code duplication.
