# Organizing and Structuring Tests

Organizing your tests effectively is essential to maintaining clarity, scalability, and reliability as your C++ project grows. This guide presents best practices and practical approaches to structuring test suites and test cases using GoogleTest, helping you keep tests manageable and expressive.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

- **Purpose:** Help you design a logical and maintainable hierarchy of tests to handle complexity in large codebases.
- **Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of GoogleTest concepts such as test cases, fixtures, and assertions (see [Core Concepts and Terminology](overview/core-concepts/concepts-terminology)).
- **Outcome:** By following this guide, you'll be able to structure your tests using intuitive naming conventions and grouping strategies, facilitating easier test discovery, debugging, and maintenance.
- **Time Estimate:** 15â€“30 minutes to understand and start applying the guidelines.
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate (focus on test organization rather than basic usage).

---

## 2. How to Structure Your Tests

### 2.1 Use Test Suites (Test Cases) to Group Related Tests

GoogleTest organizes tests into **test suites** (formerly called test cases), each grouping tests that share common functionality or test related features.

- **Naming:** Use descriptive names that convey the area or module under test.
- **Example:**

  ```cpp
  TEST(MathUtilsTest, HandlesAddition) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 2), 4);
  }

  TEST(MathUtilsTest, HandlesSubtraction) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Subtract(5, 3), 2);
  }
  ```

- **Tip:** Group tests by the class or module they test, making it easier to locate tests.

### 2.2 Use Test Fixtures for Shared Setup and Cleanup

When multiple tests need common setup or teardown, use *test fixtures* by deriving from `::testing::Test`.

- **Benefit:** Avoid repeated code, ensure tests remain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- **Example:**

  ```cpp
  class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
   protected:
    void SetUp() override {
      db = new Database();
      db->Connect();
    }

    void TearDown() override {
      db->Disconnect();
      delete db;
    }

    Database* db;
  };

  TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanInsertData) {
    EXPECT_TRUE(db->Insert("key", "value"));
  }

  TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanQueryData) {
    db->Insert("key", "value");
    EXPECT_EQ(db->Query("key"), "value");
  }
  ```

- **Tip:** Use fixtures even if only one test currently needs the setup, for future scalability.

### 2.3 Name Tests to Clearly Express Intent

Test and suite names should clearly reflect what is being tested and under which circumstance.

- Use the format `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` where `TestName` describes the behavior or the condition:
  - `HandlesNegativeInput`
  - `ReturnsZeroForEmptyStrings`

- Avoid vague names like `Test1`, `TestCaseA`.

- Keep names concise but informative to make test results immediately understandable.

### 2.4 Avoid Overloading Test Names

Avoid creating multiple test cases with the same name in the same test suite to prevent name collisions and confusion.

### 2.5 Organize Tests by Features and Granularity

- Start from broad feature-level test suites.
- Inside each suite, group logically related test cases.
- Use nested folders or namespaces in your codebase to mirror test organization where appropriate.

### 2.6 Scale Test Suites with Parameterized Tests

If you find yourself repeating tests with varying inputs, consider using GoogleTest's [parameterized tests](guides/core-workflows/parameterized-tests).

This avoids duplication while keeping your code clean and your test coverage robust.

### 2.7 Include Documentation Comments for Complex or Critical Tests

When tests cover complex logic or important behavior, add clear comments describing what the test verifies and why.

## 3. Practical Example of Test Organization

```cpp
// Define a fixture for Calculator tests
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;
};

// Group addition behavior tests
TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsNegativeNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(-2, -5), -7);
}

// Group subtraction behavior tests
TEST_F(CalculatorTest, SubtractsPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Subtract(5, 2), 3);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, SubtractsNegativeNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Subtract(-3, -7), 4);
}
```

This example shows a single test suite with fixture `CalculatorTest` grouping related tests by operation type (addition, subtraction).

## 4. Advanced Structuring Tips

- **Use Namespaces or Test Suite Naming to Reflect Module Hierarchy:** Improve discoverability by reflecting code structure.
- **Leverage `InSequence` or Ordering Constraints Sparingly:** To test order dependencies in calls or events.
- **Separate Slow or Integration Tests:** Keep unit tests quick; place extensive integration or performance tests into separate suites.
- **Use Consistent Naming Patterns:** For example, `<Class>_<Method>_<Condition>` to quickly identify test scope.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Test Organization Issues

### Problem: Test Cases Are Hard to Locate

- **Solution:** Review naming conventions and ensure suites and tests accurately describe their scope.
- Use folder structure and namespaces that mirror the codebase.

### Problem: Tests Bleed Into One Another

- **Solution:** Use test fixtures to isolate setup and teardown properly.
- Avoid shared static or global state unless reset between tests.

### Problem: Overly Large Test Suites

- **Solution:** Break down large suites into smaller, focused suites or parameterize tests.

### Problem: Difficult to Understand Test Failures Due to Poor Naming

- **Solution:** Use descriptive names for test suites and individual tests that explain expected behavior and conditions.

<Tip>
**Practical Tip:** Start with simple test suites and gradually refactor to use fixtures and parameterized tests as your coverage expands. Well-organized tests reduce debugging time and accelerate your development.

## 7. Summary

Organize your tests by logical groups with clear, consistent test suite and test naming conventions. Use fixtures where tests share setup or teardown, and employ parameterized tests to reduce repetition. Keep test suites focused on a single module or feature for easier maintenance and faster diagnosis of failures.
