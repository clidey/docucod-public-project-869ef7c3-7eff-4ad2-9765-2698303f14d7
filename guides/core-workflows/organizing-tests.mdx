# Organizing and Managing Test Suites

GoogleTest helps you systematically organize your tests into suites, leverage fixtures for shared test state, and adopt best practices to keep your test code maintainable and scalable as your project grows. This guide focuses specifically on how to organize tests efficiently, use test discovery features, and run tests in a way that suits growing codebases.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Task Description
Learn how to structure your tests into suites, use test fixtures to share setup and teardown logic, leverage test discovery, and execute tests efficiently to maintain a clean, manageable testing codebase.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest macros and writing individual test cases.
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock properly installed and configured.
- C++ compiler with standard support for your project.

### Expected Outcome
- You will be able to group related tests logically into suites.
- Understand how to share setup/cleanup code using fixtures.
- Harness Google's test discovery to run subsets of tests.
- Know how to manage test order and dependencies for clarity and performance.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30-45 minutes to fully grasp concepts and apply them.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate: assumes you have baseline knowledge of creating tests and want to organize them better.

## 2. Organizing Tests into Suites

GoogleTest uses the concept of **test suites** (previously known as test cases) to group related test functions. This enhances readability and maintainability.

### Basic Suite Structure
You declare a test using the `TEST` macro:

```cpp
TEST(SuiteName, TestName) {
  // Test code here
}
```

- All tests with the same `SuiteName` belong to the same suite.
- Suite names should group tests that exercise the same component or feature.

### Practical Example
If you have a class `Calculator`, you might have:

```cpp
TEST(Calculator, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator.Add(1, 2), 3);
}

TEST(Calculator, Subtraction) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator.Subtract(5, 3), 2);
}
```

This way, all math-related tests logically reside within the `Calculator` suite.

### Best Practices
- Name suites to correspond to a class or component name.
- Keep unrelated tests in separate suites.
- Use meaningful test names reflecting the test intent.

## 3. Using Test Fixtures for Shared State

When tests share common setup or teardown code, manually duplicating it in every test becomes error-prone and hard to maintain. GoogleTest provides **test fixtures** to solve this elegantly.

### Define a Fixture Class
Create a subclass of `::testing::Test`:

```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator = Calculator();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up if needed
  }

  Calculator calculator;
};
```

### Write Tests Using Fixture
Use the `TEST_F` macro, which gains access to fixture members:

```cpp
TEST_F(CalculatorTest, Multiplication) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator.Multiply(2, 4), 8);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, Division) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator.Divide(9, 3), 3);
}
```

### Outcome
- Each test runs `SetUp()` before executing and `TearDown()` after.
- Shared `calculator` instance simplifies test code.

### Tips and Pitfalls
- Always keep `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` lightweight to avoid slowing tests.
- Avoid sharing state that may cause test interactions; design fixtures so tests can run independently.
- For expensive setups, consider using `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` (static methods) for suite-level setup.

---

## 4. Test Discovery and Filtering

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests defined using `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros.

### Running All Tests
Simply execute your test binary:

```shell
./my_tests
```
This runs all tests in all suites.

### Running Specific Suites or Tests
Use the `--gtest_filter` flag:

```shell
# Run the Calculator suite tests only
./my_tests --gtest_filter=Calculator.*

# Run a specific test
./my_tests --gtest_filter=Calculator.Multiplication

# Run tests except some
./my_tests --gtest_filter=-Calculator.Division
```

### Practical Scenario
Filter tests to speed debugging after changing a specific part of your code.

### Filtering Syntax
- Wildcards (`*`) match zero or more characters.
- Multiple patterns can be specified, separated by `:`.

### Best Practice
Keep tests small and focused to take advantage of filtering.

## 5. Managing Test Order and Dependencies

By default, test execution order is undefined and may vary between runs.

### Avoid Test Interdependence
Each test should be independent; avoid assumptions about test order.

### Use Sequences and Dependency Mechanisms for Mock Calls
Within mocks, GoogleMock allows specifying call order using `Sequence` and `InSequence` to express expected call order, but this is generally not for test ordering.

### When Test Order Matters
Rarely needed, but you can:
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize order and catch interdependent tests.
- Use the `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for shared resources that can affect test state.

---

## 6. Running Tests Efficiently

### Parallel Test Execution
GoogleTest can support parallel test execution using external tools like
[test parallelizers](https://github.com/google/googletest#running-parallel-tests), but this is outside the direct scope of GoogleTest itself.

### Test Suites as Units
Structure tests into suites according to features or components so you can run them selectively.

### Use Test Filters
As described earlier, leverage `--gtest_filter` to minimize test scope while debugging or in CI pipelines.

---

## 7. Summary of Best Practices

- Use **test suites** to logically group related tests.
- Use **test fixtures** (`TEST_F`) to share setup and reuse code.
- Make tests **independent** from each other.
- Use **filters** to run subsets of tests efficiently.
- Avoid shared global state between tests.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive setups.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Expectations on mocks not met:** Confirm your expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) are set before exercising mocks.
- **Tests fail unpredictably due to order:** Ensure tests do not share state or depend on order.
- **Setup/Teardown code not running:** Confirm you used `TEST_F` instead of `TEST`.

### Tips
- Use GoogleTest's verbose output for debugging test discovery with `--gtest_list_tests`.
- Consider using **subtests** or **parameterized tests** if you find many similar tests cluttering suites.
