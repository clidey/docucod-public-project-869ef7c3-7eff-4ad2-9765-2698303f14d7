# Structuring and Running Test Suites

## Overview

This guide provides you with best practices and actionable strategies to organize your GoogleTest unit tests efficiently. You'll learn how to structure your test files and suites logically, leverage GoogleTest's automatic test discovery, and run tests selectively to maintain scalability and ease of maintenance as your project grows.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with writing tests using GoogleTest macros such as `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`.
- Your project is configured to build and run tests using GoogleTest (see [Project Setup](../getting-started/configuration-and-first-run/project-setup)).

## Expected Outcome

You will be able to:
- Structure test files and suites to reflect your codebase.
- Use naming conventions that enable automatic test discovery.
- Run your entire test suite or selected tests efficiently.

## Time Estimate

Approximately 15 minutes to understand concepts and apply file organization practices.

## Difficulty Level

Beginner / Intermediate

## Organizing Your Test Suites

Test suites group related tests together, helping to keep your tests clear and maintainable.

### Use Test Suites to Mirror Code Structure

- Group tests by the class, module, or feature they target.
- Use consistent suite naming that corresponds to the component being tested, e.g., `MathUtilsTest` for math utility tests.

### Use Fixtures for Shared Setup

- When tests share common setup or teardown, create a test fixture class derived from `testing::Test` and use `TEST_F()`.

### Keep Tests in Separate Files

- Place tests for different components into separate source files named after the component, e.g., `math_utils_test.cc`.
- This enables easier maintenance, parallel compilation, and selective running.

<Tip>
Organizing your tests by components with separate files and suites maps directly to your codebase’s design, making it easier for you and others to find, understand, and maintain tests.

## Naming Conventions and Test Discovery

GoogleTest discovers tests based on suites and test names using your `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros.

### Suite and Test Names

- Suite names and test names should be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.
- Suite names should reflect the classes or modules tested, and test names should describe the tested behavior.

### Test File Naming

- Although GoogleTest does not require special names, follow a consistent naming pattern like `<component>_test.cc` or `<component>_unittest.cc` to simplify CI setup and developer workflows.

### Running Tests Selectively

- Use GoogleTest command line flags to run specific tests by suite/test name patterns, e.g., `--gtest_filter=MathUtilsTest.*` to run all tests in `MathUtilsTest`.

- Combine filters with wildcards to fine-tune the selection.

#### Example

```bash
./run_tests --gtest_filter=QueueTest.DequeueWorks
```

---

## Running Test Suites Efficiently

### Running All Tests

By default, running your test binary with no arguments runs all available tests discovered automatically.

```bash
./run_tests
```

### Running Specific Tests or Suites

Use the `--gtest_filter` flag with suite or test names:

```bash
# Run all tests in a suite
./run_tests --gtest_filter=StackTest.*

# Run a single test case
./run_tests --gtest_filter=StackTest.PushWorks

# Run multiple tests matching patterns
./run_tests --gtest_filter=StackTest.PushWorks:StackTest.PopWorks
``` 

### Excluding Tests

To exclude tests, prefix a pattern with a minus:

```bash
./run_tests --gtest_filter=-StackTest.FlakyTest*
```

## Tips for Scalable Test Suites

- **Limit test file sizes**: Keep test files reasonably small to avoid complex dependencies.
- **Group related tests tightly**: Tests in the same suite should be closely related.
- **Avoid test dependencies**: Each test should be independent.
- **Use test fixtures for repeated setup/teardown**.
- **Document test intentions clearly** with descriptive names.

<Note>
Keep in mind that large monolithic test suites slow down test discovery and execution. Splitting them enables parallelism and better developer productivity.
</Note>

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Overly generic suite/test names**: These make test failures harder to diagnose.
- **Mixing unrelated tests in one suite**: Complicates setup and teardown.
- **Ignoring Test Filters**: Running all tests indiscriminately can waste time.
- **Inconsistent naming conventions**: Leads to difficulty in automation and test management.

---

## Verification and Debugging

- After running tests, verify that output groups tests by suites for easy navigation.
- If tests do not appear in your test runner, verify that your `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros are correctly named and visible to your build system.

---

## Summary

Structuring and running test suites effectively empowers you to manage complex testing needs as your codebase grows. By organizing test files logically, adopting clear naming conventions, and using GoogleTest’s test discovery and filtering capabilities, you ensure your tests run quickly and remain maintainable.

## Example

```cpp
// Filename: math_utils_test.cc

#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "math_utils.h"  // Your actual code

// Test suite for the MathUtils class
TEST(MathUtilsTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(MathUtils::Factorial(3), 6);
}

// Fixture to test a complex Calculator
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator_.Initialize();
  }

  Calculator calculator_;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsNumbersCorrectly) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator_.Add(1, 2), 3);
}

// Run this suite individually with:
// ./run_tests --gtest_filter=MathUtilsTest.*
```

<Tip>
Starting with clear and well-named test suites reduces costs of refactoring tests later. Always favor readability and maintainability.
