# Structuring and Organizing Tests

Organizing your tests effectively is crucial to maintaining a scalable, readable, and maintainable test codebase. This guide will help you master the structure of test suites, the use of test fixtures, appropriate naming conventions, grouping strategies, and how to share setup and teardown logic for common test resources.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Suites and Tests

### What Is a Test Suite?
- A **test suite** groups related tests under a common name.
- Test suites represent logical groupings often reflecting classes, modules, or features.
- In GoogleTest, the test suite name is the first argument in the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macro.

### What Is a Test?
- A **test** is an individual test case verifying one aspect of the system.
- Each test has a unique name within its test suite (the second argument in `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`).

### Naming Rules and Recommendations
- Use **valid C++ identifiers** for test suite and test names; avoid underscores (`_`).
- Follow consistent naming conventions matching your project's style guidelines.
- Prefer descriptive names that clearly state what the test validates.

### Example
```cpp
TEST(Vector, SizeInitiallyZero) {
  Vector v;
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 0);
}
```
- `Vector` is the test suite.
- `SizeInitiallyZero` is the test name.

## 2. Using Test Fixtures for Shared Setup and Cleanup

When tests need to share common data and setup/cleanup code, test fixtures are the way to organize this.

### What Is a Test Fixture?
- A test fixture is a class derived from `::testing::Test`.
- It encapsulates shared objects, and setup/teardown logic.
- Each test using the fixture runs against a fresh instance.

### Creating a Test Fixture
1. Define a class derived from `::testing::Test`.
2. Declare member variables for shared objects.
3. Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for per-test initialization and cleanup.

### Writing Tests with Fixtures
- Use the `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` macro.
- Inside the test, access fixture members directly.

### Example
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, IsConnectedInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.IsConnected());
}
```

### Best Practices
- Use the fixture constructor for trivial object initialization.
- Use `SetUp()` for operations that could fail or generate fatal errors.
- Avoid shared mutable state between tests; each test should run independently.

---

## 3. Managing Shared Resources Across Tests

Sometimes, resource initialization is expensive or global in nature.

### Using `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`
- These are static functions in your test fixture class.
- `SetUpTestSuite()` runs once before the first test in the suite.
- `TearDownTestSuite()` runs once after the last test in the suite.
- They enable sharing expensive resources without recreating them per test.

### Example
```cpp
class CacheTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    cache = new Cache();
    cache->LoadFromDisk();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete cache;
    cache = nullptr;
  }

  static Cache* cache;
};
Cache* CacheTest::cache = nullptr;

TEST_F(CacheTest, LookupExistingKey) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(cache->Contains("foo"));
}
```

### Important Notes
- Because GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance for each test, static members are necessary to share data.
- Mark `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` as `public` if you use them with `TEST_P`.
- Be careful with resource cleanup to avoid memory leaks, especially in inherited fixtures.

## 4. Grouping Tests Logically

Logical grouping improves readability and helps users find tests faster.

### Strategies
- **By Module or Feature:** One test suite per code module, class, or feature.
- **By Test Type:** Group functional, performance, and edge case tests separately.
- **By Use Cases:** Include positive, negative, and boundary condition test suites.

### Using Nested or Hierarchical Grouping
- GoogleTest does not support nested test suites.
- You can mimic hierarchy using consistent naming patterns.

### Example
```cpp
TEST(MathUtils_Addition, HandlesPositive) { ... }
TEST(MathUtils_Addition, HandlesNegative) { ... }
TEST(MathUtils_Factorial, HandlesZero) { ... }
TEST(MathUtils_Factorial, HandlesPositive) { ... }
```

## 5. Naming Conventions for Clarity

Consistency in naming helps your tests communicate intent clearly.

### Guidelines
- Use **CamelCase** or **PascalCase** (depending on your project styles).
- Avoid underscores `_` in test suite and test names; they may cause internal naming conflicts.
- Include the condition or behavior being tested in the test name.
- For parameterized or typed tests, avoid ambiguous names.

### Examples
```cpp
TEST(StringUtils, IsEmptyOnDefault) { ... }
TEST(HttpClient, Returns404ForMissingPage) { ... }
```

### Special Cases
- Prefix disabled tests with `DISABLED_`.
- Prefix death tests suites with `*DeathTest` for proper ordering.

---

## 6. Organizing Parameterized and Typed Tests

### Parameterized Tests
- Use `TEST_P` for parameterized tests that run with multiple input values.
- Instantiate your test suite using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### Typed Tests
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` to run the same tests over multiple types.

### Best Practices
- Keep parameter and type names descriptive.
- Provide custom parameter name generators if automatic names are ambiguous.

| Task                            | Best Practice                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------|
| Group tests logically            | One suite per feature, mimic hierarchy via naming|
| Share setup/cleanup             | Use test fixtures, `SetUp`/`TearDown`, static `SetUpTestSuite`|
| Name tests descriptively        | Avoid underscores, use CamelCase, state intent clearly|
| Avoid shared mutable test state | Tests should be independent and repeatable       |
| Use parameterized tests judiciously | Reuse test code for various inputs           |

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="Tests Not Discovered or Running">
Make sure test suite and test names follow naming conventions (no underscores).
Verify you use `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros properly.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Failures Due to Shared State">
Avoid shared mutable static data without proper synchronization. Use fresh fixtures for each test.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Setup Ordering Problems">
Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` carefully, declare them `public` when needed.
</Accordion>
