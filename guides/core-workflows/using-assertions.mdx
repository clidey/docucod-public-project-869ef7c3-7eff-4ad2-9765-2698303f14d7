# Using Assertions Effectively

Master the versatility of GoogleTest assertions—from equality and exception checks to custom conditions—so you can express intent clearly and catch failures with actionable output.

---

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you leverage GoogleTest assertions effectively to write clear, robust, and maintainable unit tests. You'll learn how to apply a variety of assertions—from simple Boolean checks to complex predicate and exception assertions—to express precise test intent and get meaningful feedback on failures.

### Prerequisites
- A working GoogleTest installation and project setup.
- Basic knowledge of writing tests using GoogleTest.
- Access to `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` in your test files.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Use assertion macros properly to verify code correctness.
- Distinguish between fatal and nonfatal assertions and choose appropriately.
- Utilize different types of assertions, including binary comparison, string comparisons, floating-point comparisons, exception handling, predicate-based, and death assertions.
- Write assertions with custom failure messages and understand default behaviors.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 20-30 minutes to review and practice key assertion types.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Guide to Using Assertions

GoogleTest provides an extensive set of assertion macros and utilities, allowing test authors to express expectations in a way that best fits their test scenario. This guide walks you through practical uses and best practices.

### 1. Understanding Assertion Types: EXPECT_ vs ASSERT_

- **EXPECT_ assertions** produce *nonfatal* failures, allowing the test function to continue running. Use these when you want to check multiple conditions without aborting on first failure.
- **ASSERT_ assertions** produce *fatal* failures and immediately abort the current test function. Use these when further progress depends on a precondition (e.g., valid object construction).

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Validation failed.";  // Test continues even if false.
ASSERT_TRUE(is_initialized) << "Initialization failed.";  // Test stops if false.
```

### 2. Explicit Success and Failure

Sometimes, success or failure depends on flow rather than a Boolean condition.

- Use `SUCCEED()` to explicitly mark a successful assertion (does not guarantee overall test success).
- Use `FAIL()` to generate a fatal failure unconditionally.
- Use `ADD_FAILURE()` to add a nonfatal failure unconditionally.

**Example:**
```cpp
switch (status) {
  case OK:
    SUCCEED();  // Document that this branch corresponds to success.
    break;
  default:
    FAIL() << "Unexpected status code: " << status;
}
```

### 3. Boolean Condition Assertions

- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` and `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` check that `condition` is true.
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` and `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` check that `condition` is false.

Use these for simple Boolean validations.

### 4. Binary Comparison Assertions

Use these to compare values with standard operators:
- `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)` / `ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual)` — equality (`==`)
- `EXPECT_NE`/`ASSERT_NE` — inequality (`!=`)
- `EXPECT_LT`/`ASSERT_LT` — less than
- `EXPECT_LE`/`ASSERT_LE` — less than or equal to
- `EXPECT_GT`/`ASSERT_GT` — greater than
- `EXPECT_GE`/`ASSERT_GE` — greater than or equal to

**Important:**
- For pointers, `EXPECT_EQ` compares addresses, not pointed-to content.
- For C strings (`const char*`), use string-specific assertions (see below).

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(42, result) << "Result does not equal 42";
ASSERT_LT(value, max_limit);
```

### 5. String Comparison Assertions (C-strings)

GoogleTest distinguishes **C strings** from objects like `std::string`.

Use these when comparing `const char*` or `wchar_t*`:
- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` — strings have the same content.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` — different content.
- `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)` — same content ignoring case.
- `EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2)` — different content ignoring case.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ("hello", greeting);
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(user_input, expected_input);
```

### 6. Floating-Point Comparisons

Because exact equality comparison of floating-point numbers is usually unsafe due to rounding issues, use special floating-point comparisons:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ` — compares `float` values approximately (within 4 ULPs).
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ` — compares `double` values approximately (within 4 ULPs).
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` / `ASSERT_NEAR` — verifies values differ by no more than `abs_error`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(3.1415, pi_approximation);
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated_value, expected_value, 0.001);
```

### 7. Exception Assertions

When exceptions are enabled, GoogleTest allows you to verify exception behavior:

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` / `ASSERT_THROW(...)` — expects `statement` to throw an exception of specified type.
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW(...)` — expects any exception.
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW(...)` — expects no exceptions.

**Note:** The `statement` can be a compound block wrapped in `{}`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(DivideByZero(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(DoWorkSafely());
```

### 8. Using Predicates for Custom Conditions

Sometimes a complex logical condition cannot be expressed with built-in matchers or comparisons. You can use predicate assertions:

- `EXPECT_PRED1(pred, val1)`, ..., `EXPECT_PRED5(pred, val1, ..., val5)` and their `ASSERT_` variants.
- The `pred` is a function or functor returning `bool` when given the arguments.

GoogleTest will print detailed failure messages including argument values if the predicate fails.

**Example:**
```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return (n % 2) == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

For advanced formatting and messages, you can use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT` with predicate-formatter functions returning `testing::AssertionResult`.

### 9. Using Matchers with EXPECT_THAT

Use the powerful `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` and `ASSERT_THAT` macros to check conditions with expressive matchers.

Matchers facilitate readable conditions like checking string prefixes, regex, or composite conditions:

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;

EXPECT_THAT(my_string, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(code, MatchesRegex("Error .* at line \d+"));
```

See the [Matchers Reference](../reference/matchers.md) for an extensive list.

### 10. Death Assertions

GoogleTest supports testing that code terminates or crashes as expected.

- `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)` / `ASSERT_DEATH`: expects `statement` to crash and produce stderr output matching `regex`.
- Variants include `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED`, `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH`, and `EXPECT_EXIT` with predicates.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(DoSomethingUnsafe(), "Segmentation fault");
EXPECT_EXIT(NormalExit(), ::testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "Success");
```

### 11. Adding Custom Failure Messages

All assertion macros support streaming a custom message appended to failure reports using the `<<` operator.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(42, GetAnswer()) << "Expected the answer to life";
```

### 12. Best Practices & Tips

- Use `ASSERT_` assertions for critical conditions that must hold before subsequent test steps.
- Avoid overusing `EXPECT_` that continue execution if failure leads to nonsensical results.
- Use matchers and predicates to express readable, maintainable conditions.
- Always provide custom messages if a failure is not self-explanatory.
- Use death assertions sparingly and only when testing code expected to abort or crash.

## Examples & Code Samples

### Basic Boolean Check
```cpp
TEST(SimpleTest, BooleanAssertion) {
  bool condition = SomeFunction();
  EXPECT_TRUE(condition) << "SomeFunction should return true.";
}
```

### String Equality Check
```cpp
TEST(StringTest, CaseInsensitiveCompare) {
  const char* input = "Google";
  EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(input, "google");
}
```

### Floating-Point Approximate Equality
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, PiCalculation) {
  double pi_estimate = CalculatePi();
  EXPECT_NEAR(pi_estimate, 3.1415926535, 1e-6);
}
```

### Exception Testing
```cpp
TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_THROW(ProcessInput(nullptr), std::invalid_argument);
}
```

### Predicate Assertion
```cpp
bool IsPrime(int n) {
  if (n < 2) return false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}

TEST(MathTest, PrimeCheck) {
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsPrime, 7);  // Passes
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsPrime, 8);  // Fails
}
```

### Using Matchers
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using testing::StartsWith;

TEST(StringTest, StartsWithMatcher) {
  std::string greeting = "Hello, world!";
  EXPECT_THAT(greeting, StartsWith("Hello"));
}
```

### Death Test
```cpp
TEST(FatalTest, DeathTestExample) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(CallCrashFunction(), ".*Segmentation fault.*");
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Assertion macros run on expressions with side effects:** Remember arguments evaluate exactly once; avoid unexpected side effects in assertion expressions.
- **Comparing pointers with `EXPECT_EQ` expecting content equality:** Use `EXPECT_STREQ` for C strings.
- **Floating-point equality using `EXPECT_EQ`:** Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR`.
- **Exception assertions failing due to disabled exceptions:** Ensure exceptions are enabled in your build.
- **Death test not working on unsupported platforms:** Use `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED`.

### Best Practices

- Favor `EXPECT_` to allow multiple assertions per test unless the failure invalidates further checking.
- Use clear, descriptive custom messages to clarify assertion intent.
- Define predicates or matchers for complex assertion logic.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers to write expressive assertions.
- Validate floating-point calculations with approximate assertions.

### Performance Considerations

- Assertions have minimal performance impact but avoid complex computations inside assertion macros.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for better diagnostics at low runtime cost.

### Alternative Approaches

- Create custom matchers for domain-specific validation to improve test clarity.
- Use predicate format assertions (`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT`) when needing detailed failure messages.

<Note>
Remember: `EXPECT_` assertions report failures but continue execution, while `ASSERT_` assertions abort the current function on failure. Choose carefully to get the most precise and meaningful test behavior.
