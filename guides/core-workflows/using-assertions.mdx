# Using Assertions Effectively

## Workflow Overview

Assertions in GoogleTest are the foundation of verifying code behavior. This guide helps you understand how to use assertions effectively to write clear, reliable tests that precisely verify the correctness of your code.

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with C++.
- GoogleTest framework installed and set up.
- Understanding of test cases and test suites.

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Use various assertion macros suitable for different test scenarios.
- Differentiate between fatal and non-fatal assertions.
- Write clear assertions with custom failure messages.
- Choose appropriate assertions for specific data types and conditions.

### Time Estimate

10 to 20 minutes to understand and practice assertion usage.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate.

## Understanding Assertions

Assertions are statements that verify conditions during tests. A test's success or failure depends on whether its assertions pass or fail.

There are two categories:

- **Fatal Assertions** (`ASSERT_*` macros): Cause immediate test function exit on failure.
- **Non-fatal Assertions** (`EXPECT_*` macros): Report failure but allow the test to continue.

Use non-fatal assertions when you want to check multiple conditions in one test. Use fatal assertions when failure should stop further execution (e.g. invalid preconditions).

---

## Commonly Used Assertions

### Boolean Conditions

- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)`

Verify a condition is true or false.

### Equality and Inequality

For comparing values, GoogleTest provides a range of macros:

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)`
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)`
- `EXPECT_LT(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_LT(val1, val2)`
- `EXPECT_LE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_LE(val1, val2)`
- `EXPECT_GT(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_GT(val1, val2)`
- `EXPECT_GE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_GE(val1, val2)`

**Note:** Use `EXPECT_STREQ`/`ASSERT_STREQ` for C-string content comparison to avoid pointer equality.

### String Assertions

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)`: Compare C strings for equality.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)`: Compare C strings for inequality.
- Case insensitive variants: `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASENE`.

### Floating-Point Comparisons

Because floating-point numbers can be imprecise, GoogleTest offers approximate equality:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)`: For `float` values, compares within 4 ULPs.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)`: For `double` values.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` / `ASSERT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)`: Compares within an absolute error bound.

### Exception Assertions

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` / `ASSERT_THROW`: Verify code throws a specific exception.
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW`: Verify code throws any exception.
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW`: Verify code does not throw.

---

## Writing Clear Assertions with Custom Messages

You can add informative messages to assertions for easier debugging. Use the streaming operator `<<`:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value, expected) << "Value did not match expected.";
```

This message will appear when the assertion fails.

---

## Best Practices for Effective Assertions

- **Choose the right assertion type:** Use `EXPECT_*` for non-fatal errors when subsequent checks make sense, and `ASSERT_*` for fatal errors requiring test termination.
- **Avoid overly strict specifications:** Only assert what's essential to prevent fragile tests.
- **Use matchers for flexibility:** Integrate GoogleMock matchers (see [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md)) for convenient argument validation.
- **Be cautious with floating-point comparisons:** Always prefer `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` / `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR` over direct equality.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_THAT` for rich matching:** It allows assertions with expressive matchers from GoogleMock.

---

## Advanced Assertions

### `EXPECT_THAT` and Matchers

Use the versatile `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` to verify that a value matches a sophisticated condition or pattern.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
```

Combine matchers for complex conditions (see [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md)).

### Predicate Assertions

Use `EXPECT_PRED*` macros to test custom predicate functions. Example:

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

### Predicate-Formatter Assertions

Define more expressive failure messages with `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` macros.

---

## Examples

### Simple Equality Check

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6) << "Factorial(3) should be 6.";
```

### Floating Point Nearness

```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(CalculateValue(), 3.14, 0.01);
```

### String Prefix Match

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(user_name, StartsWith("admin_"));
```

### Exception Expectation

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(OpenFile("path/to/file"), FileNotFoundException);
```

## Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

- **Assertion fails unexpectedly:** Check if the expected and actual values are swapped.
- **Tests crash after assertion:** Ensure fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) are used where necessary to stop execution that relies on valid conditions.
- **Failure message unclear:** Provide custom messages explaining the cause.
- **Floating-point comparisons failing:** Use approximate equality macros instead of plain equality.

## Summary

This guide equips you to use GoogleTest assertions confidently and effectively, improving your testsâ€™ clarity and robustness. Remember to always match the right assertion macro to your intent, leverage matchers for expressiveness, and provide custom messages that help maintain your test code.

<Tip>
To prevent order-of-evaluation surprises with assertions, remember that GoogleTest macros evaluate arguments exactly once, so any side effects occur a single time.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For complex data types, customize printing by implementing `PrintTo()` functions, so assertion failures deliver meaningful diagnostics.
</Tip>
