# Using Assertions Effectively

Leverage the rich set of GoogleTest assertions to verify your C++ code with precision and clarity. This guide walks you through practical patterns, guiding you to select the right assertions for your testing needs, handle failures gracefully, and craft readable, maintainable tests.

---

## 1. Why Use GoogleTest Assertions?

Assertions are the cornerstone of effective testing. They confirm that specific conditions hold true at a given point in your code. GoogleTest offers flexible assertions that generate detailed messages on failure, allowing you to swiftly identify and fix issues.

### Benefits of GoogleTest Assertions
- Clear and expressive macros for common verification needs.
- Separation of fatal (`ASSERT_*`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) assertions.
- Support for streaming custom failure messages.
- Integration with GoogleMock to assert mock behavior.

---

## 2. Choosing the Right Assertion

GoogleTest classifies assertions into two main categories based on their severity:

| Assertion Type | Behavior | When to Use |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `EXPECT_*`     | Non-fatal failure; test continues. | When you want to report failures but continue execution to find more issues. |
| `ASSERT_*`     | Fatal failure; test aborts current function. | When failure precludes further meaningful testing in the current scope. |

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MyTest, Division) {
  int divisor = GetDivisor();
  ASSERT_NE(divisor, 0) << "Divisor must not be zero to prevent crash.";

  int result = Divide(10, divisor);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 5) << "Unexpected result from Divide.";
}
```

In this example, if `divisor` is zero, it aborts the test immediately to avoid undefined behavior. Otherwise, the test continues and checks the division result.

---

## 3. Basic Assertion Macros

### Boolean Checks
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` — Passes if condition is `true`.
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` — Passes if condition is `false`.

### Equality and Comparison
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`, `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Checks `val1 == val2`.
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`, `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)` — Checks `val1 != val2`.
- `EXPECT_LT(val1, val2)`, `ASSERT_LT(val1, val2)` — Checks `val1 < val2`.
- `EXPECT_LE(val1, val2)`, `ASSERT_LE(val1, val2)` — Checks `val1 <= val2`.
- `EXPECT_GT(val1, val2)`, `ASSERT_GT(val1, val2)` — Checks `val1 > val2`.
- `EXPECT_GE(val1, val2)`, `ASSERT_GE(val1, val2)` — Checks `val1 >= val2`.

### String Comparisons
- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)` — Compares **C strings** for equality by content.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)` — Compares **C strings** for inequality by content.
- Case-insensitive versions: `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASENE`, etc.

### Floating Point Comparisons
- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Approximate equality for floats.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` — Approximate equality for doubles.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` / `ASSERT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` — Checks difference is within bound.

---

## 4. Advanced Assertions

### Generalized Assertions
- `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` and `ASSERT_THAT(value, matcher)` — Use flexible [matchers](reference/matchers.md) for rich verification.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(name, ::testing::StartsWith("John"));
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, ::testing::ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

### Predicate Assertions
Use when verifying complex conditions with more readable failure messages.

```cpp
bool MutuallyPrime(int m, int n) { ... }
EXPECT_PRED2(MutuallyPrime, 3, 4);  // Passes
EXPECT_PRED2(MutuallyPrime, 4, 6);  // Fails with detailed info
```

### Predicate-Formatter Assertions
More control over formatting failure messages.

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult AssertMutuallyPrime(const char* m_expr, const char* n_expr, int m, int n) {
  if (MutuallyPrime(m, n)) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << m_expr << " and " << n_expr << " are not mutually prime.";
}
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(AssertMutuallyPrime, 3, 4);
```

---

## 5. Custom Failure Messages

All assertions support streaming custom messages to append to their output:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Result did not match expected value.";
```

These messages appear only when the assertion fails, helping clarify the context.

---

## 6. Assertion Best Practices

- **Use `ASSERT_*` for prerequisite checks:** If further test work depends on critical conditions.
- **Use `EXPECT_*` for validations when continuing on failure is useful.**
- **Use expressive custom failure messages to clarify intent and ease debugging.**
- **Prefer `EXPECT_THAT` for complex conditions using matchers for cleaner code.**
- **For floating-point, avoid `EXPECT_EQ`; use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_NEAR`.**

---

## 7. Handling Assertions in Subroutines

GoogleTest assertions only abort the current function on fatal failure, not the whole test. To propagate failure in subroutines:

- Use `SCOPED_TRACE("message")` to add context to failures within called helper functions.
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(helper())` to confirm the helper did not fail fatally.
- Check for failure with `::testing::Test::HasFatalFailure()` and handle accordingly.

Example:

```cpp
void Helper() {
  ASSERT_EQ(1, 2) << "Failed in helper";
}

TEST(FooTest, Bar) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("In FooTest::Bar");
  ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(Helper());
  // Continues only if Helper succeeded
}
```

---

## 8. Skipping Tests

Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests dynamically, optionally logging a reason:

```cpp
TEST(MyTest, ConditionalSkip) {
  if (!FeatureAvailable()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "Feature not available on this platform.";
  }
  ...actual test code...
}
```

---

## 9. Diagnosing Assertion Failures

GoogleTest provides detailed failure messages including:

- Actual and expected values.
- Source file and line number.
- Expression text.
- Multi-line diffs for strings or containers.

For debugging:

- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to drop into a debugger immediately.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add trace information.

---

## 10. Extending Assertions

### Teaching GoogleTest to Print Your Types

GoogleTest by default prints standard types and any with `operator<<`. For better output, provide:

- A `PrintTo(const YourType&, std::ostream*)` function in your namespace, or
- An `AbslStringify(Sink&, const YourType&)` overload.

Example:

```cpp
namespace foo {
class Point {
  int x, y;
  friend void PrintTo(const Point& p, std::ostream* os) {
    *os << "(" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")";
  }
};
}
```

### Predicate and Predicate-Formatter Functions

Write predicate functions returning `bool` or `AssertionResult` to create reusable, expressive assertions.

See [Advanced Guide - Predicate Assertions](../advanced.md#predicates) for detailed examples.

---

## 11. Summary Example

Here is an example combining several principles:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    SCOPED_TRACE("In SetUp");
  }
};

bool IsEven(int n) {
  return n % 2 == 0;
}

testing::AssertionResult IsEvenAR(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST_F(MyTest, Example) {
  int val = GetValue();
  ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, val));
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEvenAR, val) << "Value must be even.";
  EXPECT_TRUE(val > 0) << "Value should be positive.";
}
```

This demonstrates use of test fixture, predicate assertion, predicate-formatter assertion, and custom failure messages.

---

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Common Pitfalls
- Streaming into assertions with side-effects may cause unexpected behaviors—avoid side-effects.
- Using `EXPECT_EQ` on pointers compares addresses, not contents; use string comparison macros for string literals.
- Skipping fatal assertions in constructors/destructors; use `SetUp`/`TearDown` instead.

### Debugging Unexpected Failures
- Use `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE()` or `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE()` to verify failure messages in test utilities.
- Check for missing `ASSERT_*` in helper functions if later test steps segfault.
