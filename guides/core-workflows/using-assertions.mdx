# Using Assertions Effectively

## Workflow Overview

Assertions form the backbone of your test validations in GoogleTest. This guide takes you through the standard and advanced assertion macros that GoogleTest provides, teaching you how to craft precise, maintainable, and expressive checks in your C++ test code.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic familiarity with GoogleTest and test writing.
- Access to GoogleTest headers via `#include <gtest/gtest.h>`.

**Expected Outcome:**
- You will understand the difference between fatal and non-fatal assertions.
- Gain proficiency with various assertion macros: equality, inequality, boolean, string, exception, and death assertions.
- Learn how to improve diagnostics with expressive failure messages.

**Time Estimate:** 30â€“45 minutes to read and experiment.

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (some knowledge of C++ testing concepts assumed).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Choose Between Fatal and Non-Fatal Assertions

GoogleTest assertions come in pairs:
- `EXPECT_*`: Generates a **non-fatal failure**, allowing the test to continue.
- `ASSERT_*`: Generates a **fatal failure**, immediately aborting the current test function.

**Use fatal assertions** when further test steps depend on successful verification (e.g., testing preconditions).

**Use non-fatal assertions** to continue verifying multiple conditions within a test.

### 2. Use Basic Boolean Assertions

- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` verify that a condition is `true`.
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` verify that a condition is `false`.

*Example:*
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(7)) << "7 should be prime";
ASSERT_FALSE(IsPrime(9)) << "9 should not be prime";
```

### 3. Use Binary Comparison Assertions for Value Checks

GoogleTest provides common macros for comparing values:

| Macro           | Meaning                  | Usage Example                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_EQ(a, b)` / `ASSERT_EQ(a, b)` | Check if `a == b`        | `EXPECT_EQ(5, Compute());`         |
| `EXPECT_NE(a, b)` / `ASSERT_NE(a, b)` | Check if `a != b`        | `EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr);`         |
| `EXPECT_LT(a, b)` / `ASSERT_LT(a, b)` | Check if `a < b`         | `EXPECT_LT(value, 10);`            |
| `EXPECT_LE(a, b)` / `ASSERT_LE(a, b)` | Check if `a <= b`        | `EXPECT_LE(size, max_size);`       |
| `EXPECT_GT(a, b)` / `ASSERT_GT(a, b)` | Check if `a > b`         | `EXPECT_GT(count, 0);`             |
| `EXPECT_GE(a, b)` / `ASSERT_GE(a, b)` | Check if `a >= b`        | `EXPECT_GE(score, passing_score);` |

**Note:** For pointer comparison, use `nullptr` instead of `NULL`.

### 4. Use String Comparison Assertions for C-Strings

When comparing C strings (`const char*`), use:
- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)`: check equal contents.
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)`: check different contents.
- `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)`: equal, case insensitive.
- `EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2)` / `ASSERT_STRCASENE(str1, str2)`: different, case insensitive.

*Example:*
```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(greeting.c_str(), "hello");
EXPECT_STRNE(input, "exit");
```

### 5. Use Floating-Point Assertions for Approximate Equality

Because floating-point calculations can suffer rounding errors, do not use `EXPECT_EQ` directly for floats/doubles. Instead use:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)` for `float`.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)` for `double`.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` / `ASSERT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` use specified absolute error bound.

*Example:*
```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(calculatePi(), 3.14159, 0.0001);
```

### 6. Use Exception Assertions to Verify Exception Behavior

You can verify whether code throws exceptions as expected:

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` / `ASSERT_THROW(statement, exception_type)`: expects specific exception type.
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_ANY_THROW(statement)`: expects any exception.
- `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)` / `ASSERT_NO_THROW(statement)`: expects no exception.

*Example:*
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(ParseFile("missing.txt"), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(ProcessData());
```

### 7. Use Explicit Success and Failure Assertions

- `SUCCEED()`: Marks success explicitly; useful for documenting test control flow.
- `FAIL()`: Generates an immediate fatal failure; useful in default clauses.

*Example:*
```cpp
switch (state) {
  case START:
    ...
    break;
  default:
    FAIL() << "Unexpected state";
}
```

### 8. Add Custom Failure Messages

All assertions support streaming a failure message for richer diagnostics:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value, expected) << "Value mismatch in computation";
ASSERT_TRUE(condition) << "Precondition failed";
```

This message will be displayed on assertion failure.

### 9. Use Predicate Assertions for Complex Conditions

If testing a boolean predicate over multiple values, use `EXPECT_PRED*` macros:

```cpp
EXPECT_PRED2(GreaterThanSum, a, b);
```

Or use `EXPECT_THAT` combined with matchers for rich, descriptive checks.

### 10. Use Death Assertions for Testing Process Termination

Test that code terminates as expected:

- `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)` / `ASSERT_DEATH(statement, regex)`
- `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED` if the platform supports death tests
- `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH` for debug builds only
- `EXPECT_EXIT(statement, predicate, regex)` where predicate inspects exit code

*Example:*
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(DangerousOperation(), "Fatal error occurred");
```

### Verification and Cleanup

GoogleTest automatically verifies assertions on test teardown. Remember to avoid mixing `EXPECT_CALL()` and test calls improperly as it causes undefined behavior.

## Examples & Code Samples

### Example 1: Using Equality and Custom Messages
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  int result = Add(2, 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 5) << "Add(2,3) should equal 5";
}
```

### Example 2: Floating Point Comparison
```cpp
TEST(GeometryTest, CircleArea) {
  double area = CircleArea(1.0);
  EXPECT_NEAR(area, 3.14159, 1e-5);
}
```

### Example 3: Exception Checking
```cpp
TEST(ParserTest, ThrowsOnBadInput) {
  EXPECT_THROW(ParseConfig("bad.config"), std::invalid_argument);
}
```

### Example 4: Death Test
```cpp
TEST(AppTest, FatalCondition) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(AbortOnInvalidState(), "Invalid state");
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Assertion executes but test continues unexpectedly:** Use `ASSERT_*` for fatal failures when test must stop.
- **Floating-point equality failing unexpectedly:** Use `EXPECT_NEAR` or `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` instead of `EXPECT_EQ`.
- **Exception assertions not catching exceptions:** Ensure exceptions are enabled in build settings.
- **Death tests not running or failing:** Verify platform support and test environment setup.

### Best Practices
- Use `EXPECT_` when you want to perform multiple checks in a test.
- Prefer `ASSERT_` when a failure should halt the test immediately to avoid cascading failures.
- Always add a helpful message with `<<` to clarify failure context.
- Use appropriate comparison macros for strings (`EXPECT_STREQ`) and floats (`EXPECT_NEAR`).
- For complex predicates, use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers to enhance expressiveness.

### Performance Considerations
- Assertions are designed to be lightweight; however, avoid overusing deep matchers inside very tight loops.
