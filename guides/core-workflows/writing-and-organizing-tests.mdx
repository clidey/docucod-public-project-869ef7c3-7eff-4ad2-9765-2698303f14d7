# Writing and Organizing Test Suites

GoogleTest empowers you to create well-structured, maintainable, and scalable test suites for your C++ code. This guide focuses exclusively on how to design and organize your test suites effectively — covering naming conventions, grouping strategies, defining test cases, and utilizing test fixtures for resource sharing.

---

## 1. Understanding the Purpose of Test Suites

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
This guide explains how to structure test suites to:
- Organize related tests logically
- Facilitate code reuse via test fixtures
- Ensure maintainability and scalability as your test suite grows
- Employ consistent naming and grouping conventions

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic GoogleTest concepts such as tests (`TEST`), fixtures (`TEST_F`), and assertions
- Basic knowledge of C++ test programming

### What You Will Achieve
- Clarity on how to group tests into suites that mirror your code design
- Learn to leverage test fixtures for shared setup and teardown
- Understand conventions that reduce naming collisions and confusion

### Time Required
- Expect about 15-30 minutes to read and try the examples

### Difficulty Level
- Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Core Concepts of GoogleTest Test Suites

### Test Suites vs Test Cases
GoogleTest previously used 'test case', but now prefers the term **test suite** to describe a group of related tests. Think of a test suite as a container that groups logically related tests for a class, module, or component.

### Test Fixtures as Suite Foundations
A **test fixture** is a class derived from `::testing::Test` that encapsulates shared setup, teardown, and helper code, enabling multiple tests to reuse the same environment.

### Test Suite Structure
- Use `TEST()` for simple tests without fixtures.
- Use `TEST_F()` for tests sharing a fixture.
- Fixtures provide
  - constructor for per-test setup,
  - `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for complex preparation and cleanup,
  - static `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive, shared setup/cleanup at the suite level.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Writing and Organizing Test Suites

### Step 1: Define Your Test Suites Consistently
- Name your test suites after the class or module under test. For example, tests for class `Foo` belong to suite `FooTest`.
- Avoid underscores `_` in test suite and test names to prevent naming collisions and compiler issues.

*Example:*
```cpp
TEST(FooTest, ReturnsZeroOnEmpty) {
  Foo foo;
  EXPECT_EQ(foo.Size(), 0);
}
```

### Step 2: Use Test Fixtures to Share Data and Setup
- When multiple tests need shared data or state, create a fixture class:

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Foo foo_;

  void SetUp() override {
    // Custom setup code
    foo_.Initialize();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Custom cleanup code
  }
};
```

- Use `TEST_F(FooTest, TestName)` for tests using this fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(FooTest, HandlesNonEmpty) {
  foo_.AddElement(1);
  EXPECT_EQ(foo_.Size(), 1);
}
```

### Step 3: Leverage Test Suite-wide Setup and Teardown
- Use `static void SetUpTestSuite()` for setup that is expensive and shared by all tests (called once before the first test).
- Use `static void TearDownTestSuite()` for complementary cleanup (called once after the last test).

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Shared resource allocation
    shared_resource_ = new Resource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  Foo foo_;
  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};

Resource* FooTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

### Step 4: Group Tests Logically Within Suites
- Each suite should only contain tests that naturally belong together (e.g., tests for one class or one module).
- If needed, create multiple test suites for a large class with multiple concerns.

### Step 5: Consider Parameterized or Typed Tests for Repetitive Test Logic
- For tests that run the same logic on various input parameters or types, use:
  - `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for value-parameterized tests.
  - `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` for typed tests.

Refer to [Parameterized and Typed Tests](../advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) for detailed guidance.

### Step 6: Avoid Common Pitfalls
- Remember **GoogleTest creates a new fixture object for each test**; tests are isolated.
- Don't rely on shared mutable global state unless carefully managed with suite-wide setup/teardown.
- Avoid `_` underscores in test and suite names.
- Always define a default constructor for fixtures if you declare other constructors.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Basic Test Suite with Fixture
```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;

  void SetUp() override {
    calc.reset();
  }
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsPositiveNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(1, 2), 3);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsNegativeNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(-1, -2), -3);
}
```

### Example: Using `SetUpTestSuite` for Expensive Initialization
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static Database* db;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db = new Database("test_db");
    db->Connect();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    db->Disconnect();
    delete db;
    db = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    db->ClearTables();
  }
};

Database* DatabaseTest::db = nullptr;

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db->InsertRecord({"foo", 42}));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryRecord) {
  db->InsertRecord({"bar", 17});
  EXPECT_EQ(db->Query("bar"), 17);
}
```

### Example: Parameterized Test
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectly) {
  int n = GetParam();
  int expected = ComputeFactorial(n); // Let's assume correctness known here
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    BasicTests, FactorialTest,
    ::testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
```

## 5. Best Practices & Tips

- **Use descriptive, consistent naming:** Test suite names should reflect the component tested, and test names should describe the behavior.
- **Keep tests independent and focused:** Avoid dependencies between tests for easy debugging and maintenance.
- **Share setup sparingly via fixtures:** Share only what’s necessary within a fixture to prevent masking bugs.
- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context:** When calling helper functions within tests, use `SCOPED_TRACE` to get better insight into failures.
- **Use `GTEST_SKIP()` in `SetUp` for conditional skipping:** Skip entire test suites or tests gracefully based on runtime conditions.
- **Avoid underscores `_` in test or suite names:** It prevents naming conflicts and subtle compilation errors.
- **Understand lifetime:** Each test uses a fresh fixture instance. Do not expect state to persist between tests.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Fixture Constructor Not Found
**Symptom:** Compiler error "no matching function for call to `FooTest::FooTest()`"

**Cause:** Your fixture defines a non-default constructor but no default one.

**Solution:** Define a default constructor:
```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  FooTest() = default; // or define one explicitly
  FooTest(int some_param) { ... }
};
```

### Problem: Underscores in Test Names Cause Conflicts
**Symptom:** Runtime errors or duplicated class names.

**Cause:** GoogleTest forbids underscores in `TEST` or `TEST_F` suite and test names.

**Solution:** Use names without underscores or follow official guidance on naming.

### Problem: Shared Resource not Setup/Teardown Correctly

**Cause:** Improper use or absence of `SetUpTestSuite` / `TearDownTestSuite` for static/shared members.

**Solution:** Ensure static shared members are initialized and cleaned up in these static methods.

### Problem: Fatal assertions in constructor or destructor cause compile errors

**Cause:** GoogleTest assertion macros that produce fatal failures can only be used in `void` functions, not constructors or destructors.

**Solution:** Move setup to `SetUp()` and cleanup to `TearDown()` instead.
