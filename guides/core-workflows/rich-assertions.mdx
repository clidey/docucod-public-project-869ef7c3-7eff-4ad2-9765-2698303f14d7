# Writing Effective Assertions

GoogleTest empowers C++ developers to write tests that are clear, expressive, and robust by leveraging a wide variety of built-in assertions, the ability to create custom assertions, and using matchers for flexible and readable test conditions. This guide walks you through how to harness these capabilities to write effective assertions that precisely verify your code behavior and make your tests maintainable and meaningful.

---

## 1. What This Guide Helps You Accomplish

This guide focuses on:

- Using GoogleTest's built-in assertion macros effectively to check values, states, and conditions in tests.
- Creating custom assertions for complex validation scenarios with richer error messages.
- Employing gMock matchers within assertions to write expressive, composable, and type-safe checks.
- Understanding how to make your assertions readable and robust against internal code changes.

By following this guide, you'll enhance your ability to write tests that communicate intent clearly, uncover bugs efficiently, and assist in fast debugging.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- GoogleTest installed and integrated into your C++ project.
- Basic familiarity with writing test cases using GoogleTest.
- C++ development environment set up for compiling and running tests.

If you're new to GoogleTest, start with the [GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md) and [Writing Your First Test guide](../../guides/getting-started/first-test).

## 3. Using Built-in Assertions in GoogleTest

GoogleTest offers a rich suite of assertion macros for verifying test conditions. These assertions come with two variants:

- `EXPECT_*`: Reports failure but lets the test continue.
- `ASSERT_*`: Reports failure and aborts the current function.

### 3.1 Basic Assertions Examples

| Assertion                 | Description                                  | Example
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------
| `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2);`  | Checks `val1 == val2`                        | `EXPECT_EQ(foo.Size(), 10);`
| `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2);`  | Checks `val1 != val2`                        | `EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr);`
| `EXPECT_TRUE(cond);`       | Checks if `cond` is true                     | `EXPECT_TRUE(list.empty());`
| `EXPECT_FALSE(cond);`      | Checks if `cond` is false                    | `EXPECT_FALSE(has_error);`
| `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1,val2);` | Approximate floating-point equality        | `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(pi, 3.14159f);`

### 3.2 String Assertions

Special string assertions exist for C strings to compare by value rather than pointers:

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2);` // Checks C strings equal
- `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2);` // Checks C strings not equal
- Case-insensitive variants are available as `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ` and `EXPECT_STRCASENE`.

---

## 4. Predicate Assertions for More Complex Logic

Sometimes, an assertion needs to check complex boolean conditions where built-in assertions can become obscure or uninformative. GoogleTest provides several ways to address this:

### 4.1 Predicate Macros (`EXPECT_PRED*`)

Use `EXPECT_PRED1`, `EXPECT_PRED2`, ..., `EXPECT_PRED5` for predicates with up to 5 arguments.

Example:

```cpp
bool IsPrime(int n) { /* ... */ }
...
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPrime, value);
```

These print argument values on failure for easier debugging.

### 4.2 Using `::testing::AssertionResult`

Define predicates returning `AssertionResult` for richer success/failure messages.

Example:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(my_value));
```

Failure messages will include the reason (`"n is odd"`).

### 4.3 Predicate-format Assertions (`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`)

Provides full control on assertion messages for predicates, including reporting the exact expression strings. Useful when default messages are insufficient.

---

## 5. Using gMock Matchers in Assertions

gMock matchers are powerful tools for writing expressive assertions that describe properties your test values must satisfy.

### 5.1 Basic Usage via `EXPECT_THAT`

You can use matchers with `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` in place of bare boolean or equality assertions.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::MatchesRegex;

EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
EXPECT_THAT(email, MatchesRegex("[\w\._%+-]+@[\w\.-]+\.com"));
```

### 5.2 Common Matchers

- Wildcard matcher: `_` matches anything.
- Comparison matchers: `Eq()`, `Ne()`, `Gt()`, `Ge()`, `Lt()`, `Le()`.
- Container matchers: `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `Contains()`, etc.
- String matchers: `HasSubstr()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()`.
- Pointer matchers: `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`, `Pointee()`.

### 5.3 Composing Matchers

Use `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()` to combine matchers meaningfully.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Ge(5), Ne(10)));
```

### 5.4 Using Matchers as Predicates

Matchers can be adapted to be used as predicates in standard algorithms via `Matches()`:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int count = std::count_if(vec.begin(), vec.end(), testing::Matches(testing::Ge(3)));
```

---

## 6. Creating Custom Assertions

Built-in assertions and matchers cover many scenarios, but sometimes you need to create custom checks with descriptive failure messages.

### 6.1 Using Custom Predicate Functions

Write a boolean function or one returning `AssertionResult` to encapsulate your check:

```cpp
bool IsSorted(const std::vector<int>& v) {
  return std::is_sorted(v.begin(), v.end());
}
```

Then use `EXPECT_TRUE(IsSorted(data))` or for better messages, return `AssertionResult`.

### 6.2 Defining Custom Matchers

Use the `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, etc. macros to define reusable predicate matchers:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "is even") { return (arg % 2) == 0; }

EXPECT_THAT(value, IsEven());
```

This provides rich error output including descriptions and can be parameterized:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsMultipleOf, n, "is multiple of " + std::to_string(n)) {
  return arg % n == 0;
}

EXPECT_THAT(value, IsMultipleOf(5));
```

### 6.3 Writing Matcher Classes

For more control and better error messages, implement matcher classes with `MatchAndExplain()`, `DescribeTo()`, and `DescribeNegationTo()`. See the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#CustomMatcherClass) for details.

## 7. Best Practices & Tips for Assertions

- **Specify only necessary conditions:** Avoid over-specification to prevent brittle tests.
- **Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for readability:** Instead of writing convoluted `EXPECT_TRUE` expressions.
- **Write custom matchers for commonly repeated checks:** This increases maintainability.
- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to annotate context:** Helps debugging failures in loops or helper functions.
- **Avoid side effects in matchers and predicates:** Matchers must be pure functions.
- **Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` when custom failure messages are essential:** Improves clarity.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

### 8.1 Unexpected Assertion Failures

- Double-check that the matcher types correspond to the argument types.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls for diagnosis.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to clarify context.

### 8.2 Over-Specified Expectations Fail After Refactoring

- Avoid strict cardinalities unless truly needed.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for setting behavior without requiring call verification.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only for expected interactions.

### 8.3 Assertion Messages Too Cryptic or Verbose

- Define custom matchers or predicates with clear descriptions.
- Utilize `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` for full control over failure messages.
- Use `::testing::PrintToString()` to log complex object states.
