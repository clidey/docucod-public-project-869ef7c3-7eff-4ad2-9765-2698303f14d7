# Mastering Assertions

Harness the full power of GoogleTest's assertion mechanisms to write expressive, clear, and robust tests. This guide helps you choose and apply the right assertions to capture your test logic precisely, properly diagnose failures, and create maintainable, readable test suites.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

Assertions verify test conditions and signal pass or failure. They come as pairs:

- **EXPECT_***: Report nonfatal failures; test continues after failure.
- **ASSERT_***: Report fatal failures; test halts upon failure.

### When to Use Each

- Use `EXPECT_` macros when a failure should be recorded but subsequent code can still be meaningfully executed.
- Use `ASSERT_` macros when failure means the rest of the test cannot sensibly continue.

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(data)) << "Data is invalid";
ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual) << "Mismatch in result";
```

_Use streaming output (`<<`) for rich, contextual failure messages._

---

## 2. Core Assertion Types

### 2.1 Boolean Conditions

- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`: Passes if `condition` is `true`.
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)`: Passes if `condition` is `false`.

### 2.2 Equality and Comparison

GoogleTest provides straightforward macros for values comparable by C++ operators:

| Macro       | Description                | Example                         |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_EQ` | Checks `val1 == val2`       | `EXPECT_EQ(5, GetValue())`      |
| `EXPECT_NE` | Checks `val1 != val2`       | `EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr)`       |
| `EXPECT_LT` | Checks `val1 < val2`        | `EXPECT_LT(actual, threshold)` |
| `EXPECT_LE` | Checks `val1 <= val2`       |                                |
| `EXPECT_GT` | Checks `val1 > val2`        |                                |
| `EXPECT_GE` | Checks `val1 >= val2`       |                                |

#### String Nuances

- Use `EXPECT_STREQ`/`EXPECT_STRNE` for C string (char*) content equality/inequality.

### Examples
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result.size(), 10) << "Expected size 10";
ASSERT_STREQ(actual_str, "expected") << "Strings do not match";
```

---

### 2.3 Floating-Point Assertions

Due to rounding errors, floating-point comparisons require specialized macros:

| Macro           | Purpose                                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`| Compares `float` values within 4 ULPs    |
| `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`| Compares `double` values within 4 ULPs   |
| `EXPECT_NEAR`   | Compares within user-specified absolute error |

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated, expected, 0.001) << "Values differ too much";
```

---

### 2.4 Exception Assertions

Verify that a statement throws (or does not throw) exceptions:

| Macro               | Meaning                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_THROW(stmt, ExceptionType)` | Expects `stmt` to throw `ExceptionType`            |
| `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(stmt)`             | Expects `stmt` to throw any exception               |
| `EXPECT_NO_THROW(stmt)`              | Expects `stmt` not to throw any exception           |

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionThatFails(), std::runtime_error);
```

---

## 3. Advanced Assertions

### 3.1 Generalized Assertions with Matchers

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with GoogleMock matchers using `EXPECT_THAT`.

- Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` for expressive assertions, e.g., start with, contain regex, within range.

#### Example
```cpp
using ::testing::StartsWith;
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John")) << "Name does not start with John";
```

### 3.2 Predicate Assertions

`EXPECT_PREDn` macros let you verify complex conditions requiring multiple values or custom predicates.

#### Example
```cpp
bool IsPrime(int n);
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPrime, value) << "Value is not prime.";
```

### 3.3 Predicate Format Assertions

Use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMATn` for predicates that provide detailed failure messages.

---

## 4. Writing Custom Assertions

- Implement custom assertions as functions returning `::testing::AssertionResult`. This enables rich failure messages.

- Use `EXPECT_TRUE(MyAssertion(...))` or define macros wrapping your assertion function.

### Example
```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even.";
}

TEST(MyTest, EvenNumber) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(value));
}
```

_Tip: Write meaningful failure messages to aid debugging._

---

## 5. Handling Test Outcomes

- **Success:** All assertions passed.
- **Nonfatal Failure:** `EXPECT_` assertion failed; test continues.
- **Fatal Failure:** `ASSERT_` assertion failed; test aborts current function.

### Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_` for checks where continuing the test after failure remains meaningful.
- Use `ASSERT_` when subsequent test logic depends on the assertion passing.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Using Assertions

- Avoid over-specification: assert only what is necessary to validate behavior.
- Prefer clear, readable messages that express the intent.
- Use matchers and `EXPECT_THAT` for readable, fluent assertions.
- Customize assertion messages with streaming for clarity.
- Use `ASSERT_` sparingly to avoid too-early test abortion.
- Remember `EXPECT_` allows multiple assertion failures to be reported in one test run.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

<Tip>
If assertions fail unexpectedly, verify:
- You are asserting the correct expected conditions.
- Matchers correspond to argument types precisely.
- Use `--gtest_verbose` for detailed output.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Beware of subtle bugs caused by mixing `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` incorrectly, which can hide subsequent failures or cause premature test exits.
</Warning>

---

## 8. Examples

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::StartsWith;

TEST(SampleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  int val = 5;
  EXPECT_EQ(val, 5) << "Value should be 5";
  EXPECT_TRUE(val > 0);
}

TEST(SampleTest, FloatingPoint) {
  double result = CalculateSomething();
  EXPECT_NEAR(result, 3.14159, 0.0001);
}

TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsException) {
  EXPECT_THROW(FunctionThatThrows(), std::runtime_error);
}

TEST(MatcherTest, MatcherUsage) {
  std::string name = "John Doe";
  EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
}

// Custom assertion
::testing::AssertionResult IsPositive(int n) {
  if (n > 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not positive.";
}

TEST(CustomAssertTest, PositiveCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPositive(5));
  EXPECT_FALSE(IsPositive(-1));
}
```

- For comparison of pointers or strings, be explicit to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Leverage matchers via `EXPECT_THAT` for flexible and readable verifications.
- Compose custom assertions to encapsulate common verification logic.
- Utilize detailed failure messages via streaming to reduce debugging time.

# Troubleshooting Common Assertion Failures

<AccordionGroup title="Common Assertion Failure Issues">
<Accordion title="Mismatch Between Expected and Actual Result">
**Issue**: Assertion reports value mismatch unexpectedly.

**Solution**:
- Verify test code logic correctness.
- Add failure message to assertions to reveal test context.
- Use `--gtest_stack_trace_depth` for detailed call traces.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Comparing C Strings Incorrectly">
**Issue**: String pointer comparison instead of content.

**Solution**:
- Use `EXPECT_STREQ` or `EXPECT_STRNE` for comparing C-style strings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Floating-Point Precision Issues">
**Issue**: `EXPECT_EQ` fails for floating point close values.

**Solution**:
- Use `EXPECT_NEAR`, `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` or `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` with appropriate tolerance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Fails Prematurely Due to ASSERT_">
**Issue**: Test aborts before completing checks.

**Solution**:
- Use `EXPECT_` macros if test steps can continue.
- Reserve `ASSERT_` for prerequisite conditions.
