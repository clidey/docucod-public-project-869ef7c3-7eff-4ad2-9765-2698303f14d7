# Mastering Assertions and Matchers

Explore the rich set of assertion macros and matchers available in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Learn how to choose, combine, and customize assertions to increase the clarity and reliability of your tests—covering both built-in and user-defined options.

## 1. Understanding Assertions and Matchers

Assertions and matchers are fundamental tools in GoogleTest (gTest) and GoogleMock (gMock) that enable you to verify program correctness by checking conditions and validating function arguments. This page focuses entirely on these verification tools to help you express precise test intents clearly and effectively.

### 1.1 What Are Assertions?

Assertions are statements that check if a condition holds during test execution. They come as macros like `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` which differ mainly in their failure behavior:

- `EXPECT_` macros (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`) generate nonfatal failures, letting tests continue to run to discover multiple issues.
- `ASSERT_` macros (e.g., `ASSERT_EQ`) generate fatal failures, aborting the current test function immediately.

Assertions validate values, comparisons, or complex conditions.

### 1.2 What Are Matchers?

Matchers are composable predicates used to specify criteria for function arguments or values under test. They form the core language of argument validation in GoogleMock and extend assertion expressiveness in GoogleTest via `EXPECT_THAT`. They simplify writing flexible and readable checks without over-specifying test conditions.

For example, instead of asserting exact equality, you can write:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10))); // Value must be > 5 and < 10
```

### 1.3 Why Master Them?

Mastering assertions and matchers improves test readability, robustness, and failure diagnostics, enabling you to:

- Clearly state what behavior or input you expect.
- Avoid brittle tests that break on minor, irrelevant changes.
- Generate detailed failure messages pointing to the problem.

## 2. Getting Started: Practical Workflow

This workflow guides you sequentially through writing and using assertions and matchers to validate your code efficiently.

### Prerequisites

- A working GoogleTest and GoogleMock environment set up with your project. See [Setup & Installation guides](../getting-started/setup-requirements/) for instructions.
- Basic familiarity with writing C++ tests using GoogleTest.

### Workflow Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: Choose Appropriate Assertion Macros">
Use `EXPECT_` for nonfatal checks when you want tests to continue after failures, `ASSERT_` for fatal checks that should abort on failure.

Examples:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition);    // Nonfatal
ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2);     // Fatal
```

After each assertion, tests fail transparently with detailed messages.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2: Use Basic Comparison Assertions">
Use built-in comparison assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, etc., to verify values.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result.size(), expected_size);
```

They automatically print the expected and actual values on failure.

</Step>

<Step title="Step 3: Employ String-Specific Assertions for C Strings">
Use `EXPECT_STREQ` and `EXPECT_STRNE` for C-style string content comparisons to avoid pointer equality pitfalls.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(c_str1, c_str2);  // Compares the strings
``` 
</Step>

<Step title="Step 4: Use Floating-Point Assertions for Approximate Equality">
Floating-point comparisons require special care due to rounding errors. Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(value, expected, epsilon);
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 5: Use EXPECT_THAT for Advanced Checks with Matchers">
Harness `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` to utilize GoogleMock's matchers in assertions.

Matchers can be simple or complex predicates.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(result, AllOf(Gt(0), Lt(100)));
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 6: Combine Matchers for Complex Argument Validation">
Use combining matchers like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` to create flexible conditions.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(val, AnyOf(Eq(10), Eq(20), Eq(30)));
EXPECT_THAT(text, Not(ContainsRegex("foo")));
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 7: Define Custom Matchers When Needed">
When built-in matchers do not suffice, use the `MATCHER` or `MATCHER_P` macros to create custom, reusable matchers with informative failure messages.

Example:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy3, "is divisible by 3") { return (arg % 3) == 0; }
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(IsDivisibleBy3()));
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 8: Apply Matchers in Mock Expectations">
Use matchers to specify argument expectations in `EXPECT_CALL` or behavior in `ON_CALL`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething(Ge(5), _));
ON_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 9: Use Cardinalities to Specify Call Expectations">
Specify how many times a mock method is expected to be called using `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.WillRepeatedly()` modifiers.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_)).Times(Exactly(3));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(5)).WillOnce(Return(true));
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 10: Verify and Reset Expectations Appropriately">
Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` or `Mock::VerifyAndClear()` to verify whether expectations were met and optionally reset defaults at a suitable point.

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 11: Review Failure Messages for Diagnostics">
Inspect detailed failure output from assertions and mock expectations that include argument values, counts, and causal explanations.

Enable verbose output using `--gmock_verbose=info` when debugging.

</Step>

</Steps>

## 3. Examples of Assertions and Matchers

### 3.1 Simple Assertions

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 10;
  EXPECT_EQ(x + y, 15);
  ASSERT_TRUE(x < y);
}
```

### 3.2 Using Matchers in Assertions

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Lt;
using ::testing::HasSubstr;

TEST(MatcherTest, ComplexMatchers) {
  std::string s = "Hello, world!";

  EXPECT_THAT(s, HasSubstr("world"));
  EXPECT_THAT(10, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(20)));
}
```

### 3.3 Custom Matcher

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

MATCHER_P(IsMultipleOf, factor, "is a multiple of " #factor) {
  return (arg % factor) == 0;
}

TEST(CustomMatcherTest, UsesCustomMatcher) {
  int val = 12;
  EXPECT_THAT(val, IsMultipleOf(3));
}
```

### 3.4 Using Matchers in Mocks

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockCalculator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), ());
};

TEST(MockTest, CallWithMatchers) {
  MockCalculator calc;

  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Add(::testing::Ge(0), ::testing::_))
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(5));

  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(3, 2), 5);
}
```

### 3.5 Controlling Call Frequency and Behavior

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_))
    .Times(3)
    .WillOnce(Return(true))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(false));
```

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Prefer `EXPECT_` over `ASSERT_`** unless a failure prevents the continuation of the test.
- **Use matchers to avoid fragile tests:** match only what you need precisely.
- **Order your expectations carefully:** more specific expectations later override general ones.
- **Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or `InSequence` to express call order and lifecycle clearly.**
- **Avoid suppressing uncalled warnings by adding redundant expectations;** use `NiceMock` if warnings are noisy but unproblematic.
- **Write meaningful descriptions in custom matchers** for clear failure messages.
- **Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to debug matcher and expectation matching issues.**

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Tests Fail Because Expected Calls Are Missing or Arguments Don't Match

- **Verify argument matchers used in `EXPECT_CALL()`** match the actual calls.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace matching expectations and calls.
- Check the order of `EXPECT_CALL` statements; remember later statements override earlier ones.

### Problem: Unexpected Warnings About Uninteresting Calls

- This means a mock method was called without an `EXPECT_CALL` set.
- Intentionally suppress with `NiceMock<YourMock>`, or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for methods that may be called but not tested.

### Problem: Default Return Values Are Not What You Expect

- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior.
- Set type-wide default return values using `DefaultValue<T>::Set()` if needed.

### Problem: Mocked Method Called Too Many Times

- Use `.Times()` to restrict call counts.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after use.

### Problem: Ambiguous Overloaded Methods

- Use `Const()` for const method overloads.
- Use explicit matcher type casts or specify parameters to disambiguate.
