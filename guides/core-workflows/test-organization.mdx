# Organizing and Structuring Tests

Effective test organization is key to scalable and maintainable C++ test code. This guide offers practical best practices and examples for structuring your tests, grouping related suites, adopting naming conventions, and scaling your test codebase for long-term success.

---

## 1. Why Organize Tests? Overview

Structuring your tests properly is not just about neatness — it helps achieve:

- **Clarity:** Easier to find and understand tests related to specific functionality.
- **Isolation:** Running or filtering targeted subsets of tests improves development speed.
- **Scalability:** As your project grows, well-organized tests are easier to maintain and extend.
- **Reusability:** Shared test logic and fixtures minimize duplication.

Before we dive deep, ensure you are familiar with the core test building blocks in GoogleTest — test suites, test cases, fixtures, and parameterized tests.

---

## 2. Grouping Tests: Suites, Fixtures, and Naming

### 2.1 Test Suites and Test Cases

- **Test Suite:** Groups related tests logically, typically reflecting the class, module, or feature under test.
- **Test Case:** An individual test within the suite, focusing on a specific scenario or behavior.

Compose your tests under meaningful suites that represent a cohesive set of functionality. Name your test suites to match your code modules, classes, or functionality being tested.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

### 2.2 Test Fixtures for Shared Setup

When multiple tests require the same setup or teardown, use a **test fixture** (derive from `testing::Test`). GoogleTest creates one fixture instance per test, ensuring isolation.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Set up initial state
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  Queue<int> q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, EnqueueAddsElement) {
  q1_.Enqueue(2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 2);
}
```

With fixtures, you also get the lifecycle hooks `SetUp()`, `TearDown()` for preparing or cleaning resources per test.

### 2.3 Naming Conventions

- Avoid underscores `_` in test suite and test names to prevent name collisions and reserved identifier issues.
- Use descriptive, readable names that capture the behavior or scenario.
- Examples:
  - Test suite: `SortingAlgorithmTest`
  - Test case: `SortsAscendingOrder`

Avoid vague names like `Test1` or `FooTest` without context.

### 2.4 Test Naming Pattern

By default, a test's full name appears as `TestSuiteName.TestName`. When using parameterized or typed tests, suffixes include parameter information. Unique and readable test names aid filtering and debugging.

---

## 3. Parameterized and Typed Tests

For testing the same logic with various inputs or types, GoogleTest offers:

- **Value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P` + `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`)**
- **Typed tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE` + `TYPED_TEST`)**

Example using parameterized tests:

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(Factorial(n), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  PositiveNumbers, FactorialTest,
  testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 8));
```

Use parameterized tests to avoid duplicating similar tests and to clearly express the data-driven nature of tests.

---

## 4. Organizing Large Test Suites

### 4.1 Splitting Large Suites

Avoid huge test suites with dozens or hundreds of tests that make it hard to navigate. Split by:

- Subsystems or components.
- Common fixture groups.
- Test use-case or feature area.

Example:

```cpp
// Instead of one giant FixtureTest
class FileSystemCreateTest : public testing::Test { ... };
class FileSystemReadTest : public testing::Test { ... };
class FileSystemWriteTest : public testing::Test { ... };
```

This separates concerns, improves parallel test execution granularity, and clarifies intent.

### 4.2 Using Test Environments For Global Setup

For expensive or global setup/teardown needed once per entire test program, derive from `testing::Environment` and register with `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()`.

---

## 5. Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep tests small and focused:** Each test should verify one behavior.
- **Isolate tests:** Tests should not depend on side effects of others.
- **Use fixtures wisely:** Share setup but avoid hidden dependencies.
- **Name tests meaningfully:** Helps in quick diagnosis of issues.
- **Use parameterized tests for coverage:** Reduces duplicates and makes maintenance easier.
- **Leverage typed tests for type coverage:** Useful when testing multiple implementations or types on the same interface.
- **Avoid using `DISABLED_` prefix excessively:** Instead, fix or refactor failing tests.
- **Use sequences and expectations in mocks to verify order:** Makes complex mocking scenarios verifiable.

## 6. Example: Organizing Tests for a Calculator Module

```cpp
// Fixture for basic calculator tests
class CalculatorTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;
};

// Simple test cases
TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsTwoNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

// Parameterized tests for various input and expected output
class CalculatorMultiplyTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<int, int, int>> {};

TEST_P(CalculatorMultiplyTest, MultipliesCorrectly) {
  int a, b, expected;
  std::tie(a, b, expected) = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Multiply(a, b), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  MultiplyTests, CalculatorMultiplyTest,
  testing::Values(
    std::make_tuple(1, 1, 1),
    std::make_tuple(2, 3, 6),
    std::make_tuple(-1, 5, -5)));

// Typed tests for different numerical types
template <typename T>
class CalculatorTypedTest : public testing::Test {  
 protected:
  CalculatorTyped<T> calc;
};

using NumericTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, float>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(CalculatorTypedTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(CalculatorTypedTest, SupportsAddition) {
  TypeParam a = 1;
  TypeParam b = 2;
  EXPECT_EQ(this->calc.Add(a, b), a + b);
}
```

## 7. Summary

Good test organization reduces maintenance overhead and improves developer productivity. Group tests logically, use fixtures to share setup, name tests clearly, and embrace parameterized and typed tests for coverage. For large projects, split suites and leverage environment fixtures for global setup.

## 8. Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues in Test Organization">
<Accordion title="Tests in the Same Suite Should Use the Same Fixture Class">
GoogleTest requires that all tests within the same suite share the same fixture class. Mixing different fixtures under the same suite causes runtime errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Avoid Naming Tests or Suites with Leading or Trailing Underscores">
Names starting or ending with underscores may conflict with reserved identifiers or cause name collisions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flatten or Split Overly Large Test Suites">
If your suite has too many tests, the test output and management become cumbersome. Split suites thematically or by functionality.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Beware of Implicit Sharing in Fixtures">
Each test gets its own fixture instance. Avoid static data when you need fresh state per test.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information to failures when calling helpers or nested test subroutines, making failures easier to diagnose.
