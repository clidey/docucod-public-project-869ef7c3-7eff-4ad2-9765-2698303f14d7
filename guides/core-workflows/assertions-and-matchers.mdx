# Mastering Assertions and Matchers

Enhance your testing precision and readability by mastering GoogleTest assertions alongside GoogleMock matchers. This guide covers a comprehensive set of advanced assertion macros, powerful matchers for validating complex conditions, and practical tips to write expressive, maintainable test checks.

---

## 1. Comprehensive Assertion Framework

GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertion macros to verify your code behavior. They come in pairs: `EXPECT_*` produces nonfatal failures allowing tests to continue, while `ASSERT_*` produces fatal failures aborting the current function.

### Key Assertion Types

- **Boolean Assertions**: `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` and `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` verify whether a Boolean condition holds.
- **Equality and Relational Assertions**: `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`, `EXPECT_NE()`, `EXPECT_LT()`, `EXPECT_LE()`, `EXPECT_GT()`, `EXPECT_GE()` allow direct value comparisons with informative failure messages.
- **String Assertions**: `EXPECT_STREQ(s1, s2)` and variants compare C-strings or wide strings for equality or inequality.
- **Floating-Point Assertions**: Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ()`, and `EXPECT_NEAR()` for reliable comparison of floating-point values with error bounds considered.
- **Predicate Assertions**: `EXPECT_PRED*()` macros enable custom predicate functions for more complex logical checks.
- **Exception Assertions**: `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW()`, and `EXPECT_ANY_THROW()` verify exception throwing behavior.
- **Explicit Assertions**: `SUCCEED()`, `FAIL()`, and `ADD_FAILURE()` allow manual control over test success and failure.

### Writing Clear, Informative Assertions

GoogleTest supports streaming additional failure messages into assertions for richer diagnostic output:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(x > 0) << "Expected positive number, but got " << x;
```

This immediately improves test readability and debugging efficiency.

## 2. Using GoogleMock Matchers for Detailed Verification

Matchers in GoogleMock let you define match conditions on arguments with unparalleled expressiveness.

### Basic Matchers

- **Wildcard**: `_` matches any value.
- **Value Matchers**: `Eq(value)`, `Ne(value)`, `Lt(value)`, etc., specify exact or relational matching.
- **Pointer Matchers**: `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`, `Pointee(m)` match null pointers, non-null pointers, or pointer targets.
- **String Matchers**: `HasSubstr()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()`, and case-insensitive variants.

### Composite and Advanced Matchers

- **Combining matchers**: `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)` requires all match.
- **AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)** requires any match.
- **Not(m)** negates a matcher.
- **Container Matchers**: `ElementsAre(...)`, `UnorderedElementsAre(...)`, and variants support STL and native arrays.
- **Field and Property**: `Field(&Class::member, m)` and `Property(&Class::method, m)` match member variables or getter method results.
- **Multi-Argument Matchers**: `With()` and `Args<>` allow matching multiple arguments simultaneously.

### Using Parameterized Matchers

Write clean, reusable matchers using macros such as `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, which simplify defining custom predicates:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "checks if a number is even") { return (arg % 2) == 0; }
```

#### Example Usage:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsEven()));
```

This makes the assertion messages clearer and helps isolate the failed condition.

## 3. Writing Assertions with Custom Predicates and Matchers

Take control of assertion messages by defining predicate functions returning `AssertionResult`:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsPositive(int n) {
  if (n > 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not positive";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsPositive(value));
```

Or use predicate formatters to customize messages fully:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult MyPredicateFormatter(const char* expr1, int val) {
  if (val > 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr1 << " is " << val << ", which is not positive.";
}
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(MyPredicateFormatter, value);
```

This approach enables expressive, informative test failures.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- Use `ASSERT_*` macros only inside void-returning functions or test bodies. Avoid fatal assertions in constructors and destructors.
- Write precise matchers to avoid brittle tests but avoid over-specification that breaks on harmless changes.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` appropriately to set expectations and default actions, respectively.
- For tests sensitive to call order, utilize the `InSequence` object or the `.InSequence()` clause.
- Prefer `NiceMock` for mocks when you want to suppress uninteresting call warnings and `StrictMock` when you want such calls to cause failures.
- Always set expectations before exercising the code to avoid undefined behavior.
- Use raw string literals to write expressive regex matchers.
- Employ `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual traces when multiple assertions could fail inside helper functions.

## 5. Practical Code Examples

### Basic Boolean Assertion

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Validation failed for input";
```

### String Comparison with Matcher

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(message, HasSubstr("Error"));
```

### Composite Matcher

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(numbers, AllOf(Contains(5), Each(Ge(0))));
```

### Mock Expectation with Arguments Matcher

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, Forward(Ge(10))).Times(AtLeast(2));
```

### Parameterized Matcher Definition

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleBy, divisor, "Checks divisibility") {
  return (arg % divisor) == 0;
}

EXPECT_THAT(my_number, IsDivisibleBy(3));
```

### Expectation with Sequencing

```cpp
Sequence s;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init()).InSequence(s);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Start()).InSequence(s);
```

### Predicate Assertion

```cpp
bool IsEven(int n) { return n % 2 == 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, value);
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Assertion Problems

- **Failing without useful message?** Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with rich matchers for descriptive failures.
- **Multiple evaluations of arguments?** Assertions guarantee single evaluation, so ensure predicates have no side effects.
- **Unexpected call counts?** Check if `Times()` clauses correctly reflect tested call frequency.
- **Assertion in non-void functions?** Use `EXPECT_` variants or convert function to void with output parameters.
