# Using Assertions Effectively

GoogleTest provides a powerful and expressive assertion library to validate your C++ code behavior. This guide dives deeply into leveraging GoogleTest's rich assertions—including equality, exception, and custom predicate assertions—to write tests that are maintainable, readable, and give clear diagnostic messages when failures occur.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
This guide enables you to effectively utilize GoogleTest assertion macros and functions to verify conditions in your tests, including:
- Checking equality and inequality for various types
- Validating string content and comparisons
- Handling floating-point approximations with appropriate precision
- Asserting exception throwing and non-throwing behavior
- Creating custom predicates for complex checks
- Augmenting assertions with rich failure messages

### Prerequisites
- GoogleTest installed and configured in your project, as per [Installation Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-multiplatform.mdx)
- Familiarity with C++ test fixture classes and basic TEST/TEST_F usage ([GoogleTest Primer](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/primer.md))

### Expected Outcome
- You will be able to select and use the proper assertion macro for your code validations
- Learn how to write readable, expressive test checks that produce clear failure diagnostics
- Understand when and how to write custom predicate assertions that explain failure causes

### Time Estimate
~15-20 minutes to review and experiment with examples

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate – assumes basic knowledge of GoogleTest usage and C++

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Basic Assertions for Boolean Conditions
Use these to assert logical conditions:
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition);    // Non-fatal check
ASSERT_TRUE(condition);    // Fatal check, aborts current function on failure
EXPECT_FALSE(condition);
ASSERT_FALSE(condition);
```
They report the condition's values when failures occur to aid debugging.


### 2. Equality and Inequality Assertions
For common comparisons:
- Use `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` or `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` for equality
- Use `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE` for inequality tests

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(my_vector.size(), expected_size) << "Vector size mismatch";
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr);
```
**Important:** When comparing C strings (e.g. `const char*`), use `EXPECT_STREQ` or `EXPECT_STRNE` to compare content rather than pointer addresses.

### 3. String Comparisons
For C strings:
```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2);    // Equal contents
EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2);    // Not equal
EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2);  // Case-insensitive equal
EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2);  // Case-insensitive not equal
```
For `std::string` or `std::wstring`, use regular `EXPECT_EQ` which will compare content.

### 4. Floating-Point Comparisons
Floating-point comparisons require tolerance due to rounding:
- Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` and `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` for approximate equality checking using ULPs
- Use `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` to verify closeness within an absolute error

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated_value, expected_value, 0.001);
ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(3.14f, approximate_pi);
```

### 5. Exception Assertions
To verify exception behavior (requires exceptions enabled):
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(statement, ExpectedExceptionType);
ASSERT_THROW(statement, ExpectedExceptionType);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement);
ASSERT_NO_THROW(statement);
EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement);
ASSERT_ANY_THROW(statement);
```
Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionThatShouldThrow(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(FunctionThatShouldNotThrow());
```

### 6. Predicate Assertions for Complex Conditions
When no direct assertion macro fits your need, create functions or functors:
- If the function returns `bool`, use `EXPECT_PRED1`, `EXPECT_PRED2`,..., etc.
- For richer failure messages, use a function returning `AssertionResult` and use `EXPECT_PRED_FORMATn`.

Example using `AssertionResult`:
```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess() << n << " is even";
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4));  // Prints detailed message on failure
```

### 7. Adding Custom Failure Messages
Append informative messages to assertions using stream operator `<<` to clarify failure context:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value, expected) << "Value at index " << i << " is wrong";
ASSERT_THROW(Func(), std::exception) << "Func() failed unexpectedly";
```

### 8. Using SCOPED_TRACE to Trace Nested Calls
When assertions are in helper subroutines, use `SCOPED_TRACE` to annotate failures with context:
```cpp
void Helper(int n) {
  SCOPED_TRACE("n=" + std::to_string(n));
  EXPECT_EQ(Compute(n), expected_value);
}
```
Failure reports will include the trace message for easier diagnosis.

## Examples & Code Samples

### Equality and String Assertions
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, CheckValues) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120) << "Factorial of 5 failed";
  EXPECT_STREQ("hello", to_c_str("hello"));
}
```

### Floating-Point Comparison Example
```cpp
TEST(CalculationTest, FloatApproximation) {
  float result = ComputeValue();
  EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(result, 3.14159f) << "Result not close enough to PI";
}
```

### Exception Assertion Example
```cpp
TEST(ExceptionTest, ThrowsRuntimeError) {
  EXPECT_THROW(FunctionThrows(), std::runtime_error);
}
```

### Predicate Assertion Example
```cpp
// Predicate function returning AssertionResult
AssertionResult IsSorted(const std::vector<int>& v) {
  for (size_t i = 1; i < v.size(); ++i) {
    if (v[i] < v[i-1]) {
      return AssertionFailure() << "Element at index " << i
          << " is less than previous element";
    }
  }
  return AssertionSuccess();
}

TEST(VectorTest, CheckSorted) {
  std::vector<int> values = GetValues();
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsSorted, values);
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **ASSERT_* in Non-void Functions**: Fatal assertions abort the current function, so they cannot be used in functions returning non-void. Use non-fatal `EXPECT_*` instead or refactor to void-returning helpers.
- **Comparing C Strings Incorrectly**: Using `EXPECT_EQ` on `const char*` compares pointer addresses, not content. Use `EXPECT_STREQ` to compare string content.
- **Floating-point equality failures**: Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR` instead of `EXPECT_EQ` to avoid false failures due to precision.
- **Side Effects in Assertions**: Each argument is evaluated exactly once. Be mindful of side effects during argument evaluation.

### Best Practices
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` for checks where execution can continue, and `ASSERT_*` where failure should abort the test logic.
- When defining complex checks, write predicate functions returning `AssertionResult` for clearer failure messages.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to failures within helper functions or loops.
- Stream custom messages for clarity on failures.

### Performance Considerations
- Keep predicate functions efficient; complex success messages can slow tests but clarify failures.
- Avoid expensive evaluation in assertions that are expected to pass frequently.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use matchers with `EXPECT_THAT` for expressive matching including substrings, regex, and container contents.
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE` to assert that a statement does not generate fatal failures.

## Additional Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Tips for Using Assertions">
<Accordion title="Use Assertions Close to the Fault">
Place assertions immediately after the operation under test to localize failures and simplify debugging.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Prefer EXPECT_ Over ASSERT_ Unless Necessary">
`EXPECT_` allows multiple failures per test; use `ASSERT_` only if continuing makes no sense.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Avoid Side Effects in Assertion Arguments">
Because assertion arguments are evaluated only once, avoid complex expressions that modify state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom Messages Improve Debugging">
Append messages with `<<` to clarify failure context beyond automatic output.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use SCOPED_TRACE for Nested Checks">
Add tracing info within helper functions or loops to reveal call context on failures.

## Example Snippet
```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, BasicAssertions) {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 3) << "Unexpected vector size";
  EXPECT_TRUE(std::is_sorted(v.begin(), v.end())) << "Vector not sorted";
}

// Custom predicate-formatter
AssertionResult IsPositive(int n) {
  if (n > 0) return AssertionSuccess();
  else return AssertionFailure() << n << " is not positive";
}
TEST(NumberTest, PositiveCheck) {
  int x = -5;
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsPositive, x);
}
```
