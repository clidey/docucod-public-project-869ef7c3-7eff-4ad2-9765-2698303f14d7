# Mocking with GoogleMock: A Practical Introduction

## Overview

This guide equips you with practical knowledge to define mock classes, set expectations, and verify behavior using GoogleMock. It focuses on how to create mocks that simulate dependencies, helping you isolate and validate the code under test effectively.

You will learn core macros like `MOCK_METHOD`, essential patterns for setting expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`, and how to customize mock behavior for various testing scenarios.

---

## 1. Introduction to Mocking with GoogleMock

When writing tests, relying on real objects can be inefficient or impractical. Mock objects step in by mimicking real interfaces and letting you specify how they are expected to be used at runtime. This enables you to verify:

- Which methods are called
- How many times they are called
- With what arguments
- In what order
- What the mocked methods return or perform

GoogleMock is designed to simplify creating such mocks for C++ code.

---

## 2. Defining a Mock Class with `MOCK_METHOD`

The heart of mocking lies in defining mock classes. You derive a mock class from an interface or base class and use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to automatically generate mock implementations for virtual methods.

### Syntax

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(return_type, method_name, (args...), (specifiers));
```

- `return_type`: The methodâ€™s return type
- `method_name`: The name of the method being mocked
- `(args...)`: Argument list, inside parentheses
- `(specifiers)`: Optional qualifiers such as `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, etc.

### Key Details

- `MOCK_METHOD` **must** be used in the `public:` section of the class, regardless of the original method's access level.
- For methods with commas in argument types (e.g., `std::pair<int, int>`), wrap the type in extra parentheses or use type aliases to avoid parsing errors.

### Example

Suppose you have an interface `Turtle`:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};
```

Define a mock class:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};
```

This gives you a fully functional mock without manually implementing any methods.

<Tip>
If you encounter parsing errors with complex argument types involving commas, wrap those argument types in parentheses or create a type alias to simplify.
</Tip>

## 3. Using Mocks in Your Tests

Once you have a mock class, use the following workflow:

### Steps

1. **Import gMock Namespaces**

   ```cpp
   using ::testing::_;          // Wildcard matcher
   using ::testing::Return;     // Action to specify return values
   using ::testing::AtLeast;    // Cardinality matcher
   ```

2. **Create Mock Objects**
   ```cpp
   MockTurtle mock_turtle;
   ```

3. **Set Expectations Using `EXPECT_CALL`**

   Declare how your mock is expected to be used before it's exercised.

   ```cpp
   EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenDown())
       .Times(AtLeast(1));
   EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, GetX())
       .WillOnce(Return(10));
   ```

4. **Run Code Under Test**

   Pass the mock object to your code and let it execute.

   ```cpp
   Painter painter(&mock_turtle);
   painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10);
   ```

5. **Verification**

   GoogleMock automatically verifies the expectations on destruction of the mock object.

### Example Test

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::AtLeast;

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
      .WillOnce(Return(100));

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  bool success = painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10);

  EXPECT_TRUE(success);
}
```

### Best Practices

- Set expectations **before** exercising your code.
- Use wildcard matcher `_` to ignore arguments you don't care about.
- Minimize expectations to what truly matters; avoid over-specifying to reduce brittle tests.

<Note>
Expectations set after the mock methods have been called are ignored, leading to undefined behavior.
</Note>

---

## 4. Setting Default Behavior with `ON_CALL`

Sometimes you want to specify what your mock does by default without expecting that the method must be called. Use `ON_CALL`:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers...))
    .WillByDefault(action);
```

Unlike `EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL` does not impose expectations but tells what to do when the method is called.

Example:

```cpp
ON_CALL(turtle, GetX()).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

This means unless overridden by an expectation, `GetX()` returns 42.

<Tip>
`ON_CALL` should be placed in your test fixture `SetUp()` or mock constructor for shared default behaviors.
</Tip>

---

## 5. Managing Expectations

### Cardinalities (`Times`)

Control how many times a mock method is expected to be called by chaining the `.Times()` clause on `EXPECT_CALL`:

| Cardinality          | Meaning                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `AnyNumber()`        | Called any number of times               |
| `AtLeast(n)`         | Called at least n times                  |
| `AtMost(n)`          | Called at most n times                   |
| `Between(m, n)`      | Called between m and n times inclusive  |
| `Exactly(n)` or `n`  | Called exactly n times                   |

If omitted, GoogleMock infers cardinality based on actions specified.

### Ordering Calls

- By default, calls can happen in any order.
- To enforce ordering, use the `InSequence` object:
  
  ```cpp
  {
    InSequence s;
    EXPECT_CALL(foo, FirstMethod());
    EXPECT_CALL(foo, SecondMethod());
  }
  ```

This requires `FirstMethod()` to be called before `SecondMethod()`.

- Use `Sequence` objects with `.InSequence()` for partial orderings.

### Retiring Expectations

`.RetiresOnSaturation()` makes the expectation inactive when its call limit is reached. Useful when specifying multiple expectations for the same method that differ by argument matchers.

---

## 6. Handling Uninteresting Calls: The Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

- **NaggyMock** (default): warns about uninteresting calls (calls without expectations).
- **NiceMock**: suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Construct them by wrapping the mock class:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockTurtle> nice_turtle;
NaggyMock<MockTurtle> naggy_turtle;
StrictMock<MockTurtle> strict_turtle;
```

Use these variants to control the verbosity and strictness of your tests.

<Note>
`NiceMock` and `StrictMock` only affect mock methods defined with `MOCK_METHOD` directly in the base class.
</Note>

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Method Not Mocked (Real Method Called)

Ensure that the method you want to mock is `virtual` in the base class.

### Mocking Overloaded Methods

You must define mocks for each overloaded variant separately.

### Commas in Argument Types

Wrap argument types containing commas in parentheses or use `using` typedefs.

### Default Return Values

For methods returning non-default-constructible types, always specify an explicit action.

### Setting Expectations After Use

Never set expectations after your code has called the mock method; behavior is undefined.

### Mock Object Leak Warnings

GoogleMock verifies expectations on destruction of mock objects. If objects leak, see the warning and either delete the mock or use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to suppress.

---

## 8. Advanced Usage

### Delegating Calls

You can delegate calls of mocked methods to:

- A **fake** implementation
- A **real** object method
- A base class implementation

This is done via `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior by capturing the delegate.

### Custom Actions

Define custom behaviors in `WillOnce()` or `WillRepeatedly()` using lambdas or callable objects.

### Using Matchers

Use the wide range of built-in matchers (e.g., `_` for any, `Ge`, `Eq`) to specify argument constraints in expectations.

### Partial and Full Ordering

Control call sequencing using `InSequence`, `After`, and `Sequence` objects.

---

## 9. Summary

- Define mocks using `MOCK_METHOD` inside your mock classes derived from interfaces.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set expectations on mock method calls.
- Use matchers to specify argument conditions and cardinalities to control call count.
- Use `ON_CALL` to set default mock behavior without imposing expectations.
- Choose `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers to control uninteresting call handling.
- Verify expectations are set before mock methods are called.
- Use sequences and partial ordering to test call order dependencies.

## 11. Example Illustration of Typical Flow

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::AtLeast;

// 1. Define mock class
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x), ());
};

// 2. Use mock in test
TEST(FooTest, BarCalled) {
  MockFoo foo;

  // 3. Set expectation
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(5))
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(Return(42));

  // 4. Exercise
  int result = foo.Bar(5);

  // 5. Verification is automatic
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 42);
}
```

This test verifies that `Bar(5)` is called once and returns `42`. If the call count or arguments donâ€™t match, the test fails immediately.

---

## 12. Practical Tips

- Always mock the interface you own or control.
- Avoid mocking concrete classes directly unless necessary.
- Use `NiceMock` during early test development to reduce noise.
- Reserve `StrictMock` for tests that require strict verification.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations that must deactivate after saturation.
- When mocking methods with move-only parameters, use lambdas to create new objects on each invocation.
