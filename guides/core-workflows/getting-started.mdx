# Getting Started with GoogleTest

This guide provides a practical walkthrough to help you install GoogleTest, set up your C++ project, and write your first test case with GoogleTest. It is designed for developers new to GoogleTest or those establishing a baseline for incorporating it into existing projects.

---

## 1. What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will:

- Successfully install GoogleTest in a C++ project using CMake.
- Understand how to write and organize simple unit tests.
- Build and run your GoogleTest test binaries.
- Verify that your test setup works correctly.

Expected outcome: a working C++ test executable that runs at least one basic test and provides clear pass/fail output.

Estimated time: 20-30 minutes.

Skill level: Beginner to Intermediate.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A compatible platform (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
- A C++ compiler supporting at least C++17 (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- CMake version 3.14 or higher installed.
- A working terminal or command line environment.

For installation and platform-specific details, consult the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](getting-started/setup-and-installation/requirements) page.

## 3. Setting Up Your Project with CMake

### Step 1: Create Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and create a new folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
```

### Step 2: Create `CMakeLists.txt`

In your project folder, create a file named `CMakeLists.txt` with the following content:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(my_project)

# Require C++17 standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/03597a01ee50ed33e9dfd640b249b4be3799d395.zip
)
# On Windows: prevent overriding parent project compiler/linker settings
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

# Enable testing features
enable_testing()

# Add executable target for tests
add_executable(
  hello_test
  hello_test.cc
)

# Link with GoogleTest main library
target_link_libraries(
  hello_test
  GTest::gtest_main
)

include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(hello_test)
```

> **Tip:** The commit hash in the URL specifies the GoogleTest version. Update it regularly to stay current.

---

## 4. Writing Your First Test

Create a file named `hello_test.cc` in your project folder and add the following code:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test: verify basic assertions.
TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Expect two strings to be different.
  EXPECT_STRNE("hello", "world");

  // Expect numeric equality.
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
}
```

### What You Did Here:

- Included the main GoogleTest header.
- Defined a test case `HelloTest` with a test named `BasicAssertions`.
- Used `EXPECT` assertions to verify conditions.

---

## 5. Building and Running the Tests

### Step 1: Configure the Build

From your project root directory, run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
```

This generates build files in the `build` directory.

### Step 2: Build the Test Binary

Build the test executable with:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### Step 3: Run the Tests

Run all tests discovered in the executable:

```bash
cd build && ctest
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Test project /path/to/my_project/build
    Start 1: HelloTest.BasicAssertions
1/1 Test #1: HelloTest.BasicAssertions ........   Passed    0.00 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.01 sec
```

This confirms your first test is successfully running.

---

## 6. Understanding What Happened

- The `hello_test` binary contains your test code and GoogleTest framework.
- The `gtest_discover_tests` command enables CTest to detect and run tests.
- Running `ctest` executes the test binary and reports results.

You now have a working test automation setup.

---

## 7. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use EXPECT_ vs ASSERT_**: Use `EXPECT_*` assertions to continue test execution after failure. Use `ASSERT_*` to abort the current test if continuing makes no sense.
- **Name tests clearly**: Test suite names (first argument to `TEST`) should be descriptive and avoid underscores.
- **Follow C++ conventions**: Use valid C++ identifiers for test and suite names.
- **Keep tests independent**: Avoid state sharing without fixtures to keep tests isolated.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

- **Missing C++17 support**: Ensure your compiler version supports C++17 and that CMake is configured accordingly.
- **Build errors on Windows**: Use `set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)` in `CMakeLists.txt` to resolve runtime linkage mismatches.
- **Tests not discovered**: Confirm that `gtest_discover_tests()` is present and testing is enabled in CMake.
- **Link errors**: Verify that `target_link_libraries` links to `GTest::gtest_main`.

For detailed common issues, see the [Common Setup Issues](getting-started/troubleshooting-and-faq/common-setup-issues) guide.

## 9. Next Steps

- Explore the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) to learn how to write more expressive and structured tests.
- Review [GoogleTest Samples](samples.md) to see practical, annotated examples.
- Learn how to use [Test Fixtures](primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests) to share setup and teardown logic.
- If using Bazel instead of CMake, consult the [Quickstart for Bazel](quickstart-bazel.md).
