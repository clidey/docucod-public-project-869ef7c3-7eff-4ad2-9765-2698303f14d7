# Organizing and Running Tests

## Overview

This guide equips you with best practices for structuring your GoogleTest test suites and test cases. It explains how to leverage powerful test discovery, filtering, and parallel execution features to maximize the feedback you receive during development. You'll learn how to keep your tests clear, maintainable, and fast by taking full advantage of GoogleTestâ€™s advanced invocation options.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Organization

### What This Guide Helps You Do
- Structure tests in logical, maintainable test suites.
- Use test discovery to automatically find and run tests.
- Filter test execution to focus on relevant tests.
- Run tests in parallel to reduce feedback loops.

### Prerequisites
- GoogleTest installed and integrated in your build environment.
- Familiarity with basic test writing using `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros.

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you will have practical knowledge of organizing your tests into suites and cases that reflect project modules, controlling test execution efficiently via filters and options, and accelerating your test runs through parallelism.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 15-30 minutes, depending on your current familiarity with test invocation.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate

## 2. Key Concepts in Test Organization

### Test Suites and Tests
- **Test Suite**: Logical grouping of related tests, specified as the first argument to `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- **Test**: An individual test case, the second argument to those macros.

Use meaningful names for suites that mirror the code under test or module boundaries.

### Test Fixtures
Use test fixtures (`TEST_F()`) to share resource setup and teardown across related tests.

### Test Discovery
GoogleTest automatically registers all tests declared with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`. These tests are discovered at runtime without manual enumeration.

### Test Filtering
You can filter which tests to run using command line flags to focus on a subset, speeding up iteration.

### Parallel Execution
GoogleTest supports running tests in parallel processes or threads externally (e.g., using wrapper scripts or CI tooling), though GoogleTest does not internally parallelize tests. Structuring tests properly enables safe parallel execution.

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide to Organizing and Running Tests

### Step 1: Group Tests Logically Using Test Suites

- Group tests that verify the same functionality or class into the same suite.
- Keep test suite names concise but descriptive, reflecting the module or component.

```cpp
// Example: Test suite for the Queue class
TEST(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
    ...
}

TEST(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
    ...
}
```

- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) if tests share common setup.

### Step 2: Use Test Fixtures for Shared Setup

- Define a fixture class deriving from `testing::Test`.
- Initialize common objects in the constructor or `SetUp()`.
- Use `TEST_F(FixtureClass, TestName)` for tests that use this setup.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q_.Enqueue(42);
  }
  Queue<int> q_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, HasElement) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q_.size(), 1);
}
```

### Step 3: Run All Tests Using RUN_ALL_TESTS()

- Typically at the end of your `main()`, call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to execute all discovered tests.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- This triggers running every test suite and test case registered.

### Step 4: Run Selected Tests Using Filters

- Use the `--gtest_filter=` flag at runtime to specify which tests to run.
- The filter syntax allows wildcards `*` and negative matches.

Examples:

```bash
# Run only all tests in QueueTest suite
./my_tests --gtest_filter=QueueTest.*

# Run only a single test
./my_tests --gtest_filter=QueueTest.HasElement

# Run all except a test
./my_tests --gtest_filter=-QueueTest.FlakyTest
```

### Step 5: Parallelize Test Execution

- GoogleTest itself does not run tests in parallel internally.
- Use third-party tools or scripts that execute multiple test binaries or shards concurrently.
- Design your tests to be independent and stateless to avoid race conditions.

**Tip:** Divide large test suites into smaller suites or binaries to improve parallelism.

### Step 6: Use Other Useful Runtime Flags

- `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests multiple times (helpful for flaky test detection).
- `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order.
- `--gtest_output=xml:filename.xml` to generate reports.

See the [Test Runner & Invocation](../../api-reference/core-testing-apis/test-runner-and-invocation) doc for full options.

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Keep tests independent:** Avoid shared global state to enable better parallelism and isolation.
- **Name tests clearly:** Describe what the test verifies, using `TestSuite.TestName` nomenclature.
- **Use test fixtures for reuse:** Share expensive setup to reduce test duplication and improve maintainability.
- **Use filters during development:** Run only tests you are working on to get rapid feedback.
- **Regularly run all tests:** Ensure no regressions sneak in when focusing on subsets.
- **Separate slow tests:** Move longer-running tests to separate suites or binaries.
- **Keep tests small and focused:** This improves clarity and execution speed.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Discovered
- Ensure all tests use the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros.
- Confirm `InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Filters Not Matching
- Verify test suite and test names exactly match.
- Remember that filters are case-sensitive.

### Parallel Execution Issues
- Check for shared mutable global or static variables.
- Ensure tests do not depend on execution order or external state.

### Tests Crashing or Hanging
- Use `--gtest_break_on_failure` to break on failure.
- Check for race conditions in tests when running in parallel.

## Summary
Properly organizing your tests into suites and cases enhances maintainability and clarity. Leveraging powerful GoogleTest features like test discovery and filtering streams your testing workflow, while structuring tests to run independently enables parallelism and fast feedback. Armed with these best practices, you will achieve an efficient, scalable testing setup.
