# Structuring Test Cases and Test Suites

## Purpose and Scope

This guide helps you organize your tests effectively using GoogleTest by describing how to create test cases, group tests meaningfully into test suites, and leverage test suite features to support maintainable and scalable testing projects. It emphasizes best practices in structuring test organization, naming conventions, and real-world examples to facilitate clear, concise, and robust test code.

---

## Workflow Overview

### What This Guide Helps You Achieve

GoogleTest encourages grouping logically related tests to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability. This guide shows you how to:

- Create individual test cases with well-defined scopes
- Group tests into test suites reflecting code structure
- Apply naming conventions for clarity
- Use test fixture classes to share setup and teardown code

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with C++ and writing simple GoogleTest tests
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed and configured
- A test environment where you can write and run test programs

### Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Define test suites that group related tests sensibly
- Structure test cases to be focused and isolated
- Share common setup/teardown logic efficiently
- Achieve clear, maintainable, and well-organized test codebases

### Time Estimate

About 20 to 40 minutes, depending on your current familiarity with GoogleTest basics.

### Difficulty Level

Beginner to Intermediate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Understand Terminology

- **Test**: An individual unit of testing—usually a function verifying a specific behavior.
- **Test Suite**: A collection of related tests sharing common characteristics or fixtures.
- **Test Fixture**: A class that provides a shared environment (setup/teardown) for multiple tests.

### 2. Create Simple Tests Using TEST Macro

Start by writing individual tests in logically named test suites. Each test is declared using `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

- The first parameter groups tests in a suite.
- The second parameter identifies the test.

### 3. Group Tests Using Test Suites for Logical Cohesion

Group tests that check related functionality together into suites (by defining the same first argument to `TEST`). This promotes clarity and organized result reporting.

### 4. Use TEST_F for Tests Requiring Shared Setup or State

When tests require common setup or state, define a fixture class deriving from `testing::Test`:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    q1.Enqueue(1);
    q2.Enqueue(2);
    q2.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0;
  Queue<int> q1;
  Queue<int> q2;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

- Use `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)` syntax.
- Each test runs in a fresh fixture instance.

### 5. Name Tests and Test Suites Clearly

Follow conventions similar to your production code. Avoid underscores. Use descriptive names to clarify intent.

### 6. Maintain One Concern per Test

Ensure each test validates a single behavior or property for easier debugging and maintenance.

### 7. Organize Tests in Source Files by Feature or Module

Split suites logically across test files to reflect your project’s structure.

### 8. Enable Test Discovery and Execution

Tests registered with `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` are automatically discovered by GoogleTest runners without manual listing.

### 9. Run Tests and Interpret Results

- Tests within a suite are executed independently.
- GoogleTest reports failures with file and line references.
- Organizing tests into suites helps isolate failures and understand context.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Avoid Overly Large Test Suites:** Keep test suites focused on related functionality.
- **Use Fixtures to Share Setup:** Fixtures save duplication and centralize resource management.
- **Keep Tests Independent:** Do not rely on tests being run in order.
- **Use Assertions Appropriately:** Use `EXPECT_` when test can continue after failure; use `ASSERT_` when failure requires abort.
- **Isolate Tests for Reproducibility:** Each test should initialize all data it relies on.
- **Name Tests to Document Intent:** Clear names function as living documentation.
- **Use Scoped Setup for Fixture Resources:** Clean up resources in `TearDown()`.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Test Cases Not Detected

- Ensure tests use `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before running.

### Tests Fail Unexpectedly

- Verify that fixtures set up all needed state.
- Avoid side effects between tests.

### Confusing Test Failures Due to Overlapping Suites

- Use distinct suite names.
- Keep tests focused and don't shadow names.

### Fixtures Not Used Properly

- Confirm `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` spelled correctly (capital U). Use `override`.

---

## Examples

### Simple Test Suite

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

TEST(MathTest, Multiplication) {
  EXPECT_EQ(3 * 3, 9);
}
```

### Using a Test Fixture

```cpp
class StackTest : public testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    stack_.Push(1);
    stack_.Push(2);
  }
  Stack<int> stack_;
};

TEST_F(StackTest, PopsElement) {
  EXPECT_EQ(stack_.Pop(), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(stack_.size(), 1);
}

TEST_F(StackTest, IsEmptyAfterPoppingAll) {
  stack_.Pop();
  stack_.Pop();
  EXPECT_TRUE(stack_.empty());
}
```
