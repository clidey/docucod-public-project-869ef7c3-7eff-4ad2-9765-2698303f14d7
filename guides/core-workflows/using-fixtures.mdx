# Using Test Fixtures for Reusable Setups

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide helps you understand how to use Test Fixtures in GoogleTest to create reusable setup and teardown logic for your tests. Test fixtures allow you to write cleaner, more maintainable test suites by sharing common code across multiple test cases.

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with C++ and GoogleTest.
- GoogleTest installed and your project set up to compile and run tests.
- Understanding of how to write a simple test case in GoogleTest.

### Expected Outcome
After following this guide, you will be able to:
- Define test fixtures that encapsulate common test setup/teardown.
- Write multiple tests that reuse this common logic.
- Understand when and how setup and teardown happens during tests.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 10-20 minutes to read and implement example test fixtures.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## Using Test Fixtures: Step-by-Step Instructions

Test fixtures are C++ classes derived from `::testing::Test`. They provide a way to share data and functions among tests.

### Step 1: Define Your Test Fixture Class

Create a class that derives from `::testing::Test`. Add member variables and functions that will be available to all tests that use this fixture.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code here runs before each test
    shared_resource = 42;
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Code here runs after each test
  }

  // Shared data for the tests
  int shared_resource;
};
```

- `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods are optional but recommended for setting up and cleaning resources respectively.

### Step 2: Write Test Cases Using the Fixture

Use the `TEST_F` macro to write tests that use the fixture. Each test will automatically run `SetUp()` before and `TearDown()` after.

```cpp
TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestOne) {
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_resource, 42);
  // Additional test logic here
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestTwo) {
  shared_resource += 8;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_resource, 50);
}
```

- Each test shares access to `shared_resource` initialized in `SetUp()`.
- Fixture instance is recreated fresh for every test, ensuring test isolation.

### Step 3: Use Fixture Constructors or Other Helpers if Needed

If some initialization is needed before every test and it does not require the testing framework, consider using constructors or helper functions in the fixture class.

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  MyTestFixture() : shared_resource(-1) {}

  void SetUp() override {
    shared_resource = 42;  // Override constructor default
  }

  int shared_resource;
};
```

### Step 4: Organize Complex Test Setups

Fixtures can hold multiple objects and complex setup logic:

```cpp
class ComplexFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect("test-db");
    logger.Enable();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
  Logger logger;
};

TEST_F(ComplexFixture, TestDatabaseInsert) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Insert("record"));
}
```

This allows sharing connection setup and teardown across multiple tests.

### Step 5: Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` for Expensive Setup

If you want to perform setup/teardown once per test suite (all tests in the fixture), define static methods:

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // runs once before all tests
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // runs once after all tests
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // runs before each test
  }
};
```

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Always use `TEST_F` instead of `TEST` when the test uses a fixture.
- Keep `SetUp` and `TearDown` implementations minimal and focused on shared setup/cleanup.
- Avoid sharing mutable state between tests unless absolutely necessary; use `SetUp` to reset it.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite`/`TearDownTestSuite` for expensive shared resources (e.g., database connections).
- Fixtures should not contain test assertions; keep tests in `TEST_F` bodies.
- Name fixture classes clearly to indicate the scope of the shared setup.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Test Fixtures">
<Accordion title="SetUp or TearDown Not Being Called">
Make sure your test uses `TEST_F` macro, not `TEST`. Only `TEST_F` will invoke fixtures' setup/teardown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Shared State Persists Across Tests">
Remember, each test gets a fresh instance of the fixture class. If data seems shared unintentionally, check for static or global variables.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Expensive Setup Slowing Down Tests">
Consider moving setup logic to `SetUpTestSuite` and teardown to `TearDownTestSuite` to run once per test suite.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Compilation Errors Regarding MOCK_METHOD in Fixtures">
Ensure `MOCK_METHOD` macros are placed in `public:` section of your mock class, even if mocking private/protected virtual methods.

## Summary

This tutorial introduced GoogleTest Test Fixtures as a powerful way to reuse setup and teardown code across multiple tests. By following the practice of defining fixture classes and writing tests with `TEST_F`, you create clear, maintainable, and isolated test cases. Understanding when and how to use `SetUp`, `TearDown`, and suite-level initialization helps in optimizing test performance.

### Example: A Complete Test Fixture

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator.Reset();
  }

  // Shared object used in tests
  Calculator calculator;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, Addition) {
  calculator.Add(5);
  calculator.Add(3);
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator.GetTotal(), 8);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, Reset) {
  calculator.Add(10);
  calculator.Reset();
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator.GetTotal(), 0);
}
```

This fixture ensures every test starts with a freshly reset calculator.
