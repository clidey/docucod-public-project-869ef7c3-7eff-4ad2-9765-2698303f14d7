# Organizing Test Suites

Efficiently organizing test suites is essential for managing medium to large codebases with GoogleTest. This guide focuses on best practices for grouping, naming, and scaling test suites, while reducing boilerplate code and maintaining readability as your test coverage grows.

---

## 1. Why Organize Test Suites?

As your project expands, tests tend to multiply quickly. Proper organization:

- Keeps related tests logically grouped.
- Helps manage dependencies and shared resources.
- Simplifies identification, execution, and debugging.
- Enhances maintainability and scalability.

Without thoughtful structure, your test codebase can become brittle, redundant, and difficult to navigate.

## 2. Test Suites and Fixtures: The Core Building Blocks

GoogleTest uses the concept of **test suites** to group related tests and **fixtures** to share common setup and teardown logic.

- Each test suite corresponds to a set of tests logically related.
- Each test suite is implemented using a test fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Multiple tests (`TEST_F`) within a test suite use the fixture, ensuring clean setup per test.

**Important:** A test suite and its corresponding fixture share the exact same name.

## 3. Naming Conventions

**Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names.**

- Underscores cause internal class name collisions and reserved identifier conflicts.
- Follow the standard C++ naming conventions, e.g., `CamelCase` or `PascalCase`.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathUtilsTest, HandlesZeroInput) { ... }
TEST(MathUtilsTest, HandlesPositiveInput) { ... }
```

Use meaningful suite and test names that clearly indicate the purpose or scenario tested.

## 4. Grouping Tests by Feature or Component

Group tests by the logical feature or component under test. For example, if you have a `Database` component, group all tests for it into a `DatabaseTest` suite.

As your codebase grows, consider subdividing large suites into multiple smaller suites for different aspects or modules, e.g., `DatabaseConnectionTest`, `DatabaseQueryTest`.

## 5. Using Test Fixtures to Reduce Boilerplate

Test fixtures let you write common setup code once and reuse it across multiple tests. This avoids redundancy and keeps tests concise.

### Setting up a Fixture

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup code here
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Common teardown code here
  }

  Foo resource_;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, ExampleTest1) {
  // Access resource_ and assertions
}

TEST_F(FooTest, ExampleTest2) {
  // Another test using same setup
}
```

### Best Practices

- Put resource initialization in the fixture constructor or `SetUp()`.
- Clean resources in `TearDown()`.
- Avoid side effects across tests by ensuring fresh fixture objects per test (GoogleTest does this automatically).

## 6. Scaling Up: Sharing Resources Across Tests

Some resources are expensive to initialize. GoogleTest supports **shared resources** via **per-test-suite setup/teardown**.

- Use static members in your fixture class to hold shared resources.
- Define `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` to initialize and clean those resources once for the whole suite.

### Example

```cpp
class ExpensiveResourceTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static std::unique_ptr<ExpensiveResource> shared_resource_;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = std::make_unique<ExpensiveResource>();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_.reset();
  }
};

std::unique_ptr<ExpensiveResource> ExpensiveResourceTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(ExpensiveResourceTest, TestOne) {
  ASSERT_TRUE(shared_resource_ != nullptr);
  // Use shared_resource_
}
```

## 7. Derived Fixtures for Related Test Suites

You can derive test fixtures to add or override setup while reusing base fixture behaviors. This is useful if you have multiple test suites with common setup.

```cpp
class BaseTest : public testing::Test { ... };

class DerivedTest : public BaseTest {
 protected:
   void SetUp() override {
     BaseTest::SetUp();
     // Additional setup
   }
};

TEST_F(DerivedTest, SpecificTest) { ... }
```

## 8. Parameterized and Typed Tests for Reducing Duplication

GoogleTest provides advanced mechanisms to run the same test logic over various data and types:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests** (using `TEST_P`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) to run tests with different input values.
- **Typed Tests** (using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`) to run tests over different type implementations.

These techniques drastically reduce duplication when testing multiple scenarios or type variants.

## 9. Keeping Tests Readable

- Use clear and consistent naming for fixtures and test cases.
- Avoid overly large test suites; split logically.
- Limit complexity inside individual tests; keep them focused on one behavior.
- Use helper functions or matchers to encapsulate common assertions.

## 10. Useful Tips & Common Pitfalls

<Tip>
Always declare `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` as `public` if used with `TEST_P`. Otherwise, compilation errors may occur.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Do not rely on test execution order; GoogleTest does not guarantee it. Avoid tests with hidden dependencies.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid underscores in test and suite names to prevent subtle name clashes and compiler issues.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To temporarily disable a test, prefix its name with `DISABLED_`. It will not be run but still compiled.
</Tip>

## 11. Troubleshooting Test Suites

### Test Fixture Not Found or Default Constructor Missing

- Ensure fixture classes have accessible default constructors.
- If a non-default constructor is declared, explicitly add a default constructor.

### Conflicting Fixture Classes with Same Suite Name

- Do not define multiple fixtures with the same suite name in different namespaces; this breaks GoogleTest's uniqueness constraints.

### Failing Test Registration

- Check that `TEST_F` uses a previously defined fixture class.
- For dynamic test registration, ensure registration code is invoked before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

## 12. Advanced: Dynamic Test Registration

For cases where test cases must be created dynamically based on runtime data, use `testing::RegisterTest()`:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test { /* fixture code */ };

class MyTest : public MyFixture {
 public:
  explicit MyTest(int data) : data_(data) {}
  void TestBody() override { /* test logic */ }
 private:
  int data_;
};

void RegisterMyTests(const std::vector<int>& values) {
  for (int v : values) {
    testing::RegisterTest(
        "MyFixture", ("Test" + std::to_string(v)).c_str(), nullptr, std::to_string(v).c_str(),
        __FILE__, __LINE__,
        [=]() -> MyFixture* { return new MyTest(v); });
  }
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  RegisterMyTests({1, 2, 3});
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## 13. Summary

By adopting rigorous test suite organization practices, you ensure your testing environment remains scalable, manageable, and efficient. Harness test fixtures, shared resources, parameterization, and proper naming strategies to build a reliable C++ test codebase with GoogleTest.
