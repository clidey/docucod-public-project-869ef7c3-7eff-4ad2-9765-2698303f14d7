# Organizing Test Suites and Test Discovery

## Overview

This guide helps you understand how to group related tests systematically into test suites, structure your test code to improve maintainability, and leverage GoogleTest's automatic discovery mechanisms. As your codebase grows, maintaining a clean, scalable organization of tests becomes vital to keep testing efficient and manageable.

---

## 1. Understanding Test Suites

GoogleTest logically groups tests into collections called *test suites*. A test suite usually corresponds to a class or module you're testing and allows related tests to share common setup and teardown via test fixtures.

### Why organize tests into suites?
- **Clarity**: Categorize tests by their target class or feature.
- **Shared Context**: Use common resources efficiently through fixtures.
- **Selective Execution**: Run subsets of tests based on suite filters.

### Test Suite Terminology
- Test Suite Name: The logical grouping name for tests.
- Test: An individual test case.
- Fixture: A class that provides setup and teardown for tests in the suite.

## 2. Writing Test Suites with GoogleTest

### Defining a test suite with `TEST()`
For simple tests without shared state:

```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, TestName) {
  // Test statements here
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```

This creates a test named `TestName` in the suite `MyTestSuite`. Each test runs independently.

### Using Test Fixtures with `TEST_F()`
Use test fixtures to share setup and member variables:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Setup code here
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Teardown code here
  }

  int shared_resource_;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, HandlesInput) {
  shared_resource_ = 42;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_resource_, 42);
}
```

Each `TEST_F` test creates a fresh fixture instance, ensuring isolation.

### Sharing Expensive Resources with Per-Test-Suite Setup

You can reduce overhead by using shared resources initialized once per suite:

```cpp
class ExpensiveTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource();
  }
  
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }
  
 protected:
  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};

Resource* ExpensiveTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(ExpensiveTest, TestOne) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_resource_->IsReady());
}
```

`SetUpTestSuite()` is called once before any tests in the suite, and `TearDownTestSuite()` afterward.

## 3. Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests declared using its macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, etc.) without requiring manual registration. This enables seamless scaling as new tests are added.

### How discovery works
- The macros expand into code that registers test metadata into runtime registries.
- When `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called, GoogleTest runs all registered tests.
- Tests are sorted and can be filtered by suite name, test name, or wildcard patterns.

### Filtering Tests
Use the `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable to select specific suites or tests:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MySuite.*  # Runs all tests in MySuite
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MySuite.Test1  # Runs a single test
./my_tests --gtest_filter=-MySuite.TestToSkip  # Runs all tests except the one excluded
```

### Disabled Tests
Prefix a test or suite with `DISABLED_` to temporarily exclude it from runs.

## 4. Structuring Test Code for Maintainability

As your testing grows:

- **Group related tests** in named suites to reflect your project structure.
- **Use fixtures** to avoid duplicating setup and teardown logic.
- **Avoid test dependencies**: tests should remain independent and isolated.
- **Name tests consistently and clearly**, avoiding underscores in names.

## 5. Advanced Test Grouping: Parameterized and Typed Tests (Brief Overview)

GoogleTest also supports advanced grouping:

- Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) run tests multiple times with different parameter values without code duplication.

- Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE`, `TYPED_TEST`) run the same tests across multiple types.

- Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`, `TYPED_TEST_P`) allow defining abstract test templates instantiated with type lists later.

See the [Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) for detailed workflows.

## 6. Step-by-Step: Organizing a Test Suite

<Steps>
<Step title="Define the Test Fixture or use TEST macro">
Decide if your tests need shared setup. Use `TEST` for simple cases or define a fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
</Step>
<Step title="Implement shared setup/teardown (optional)">
Add `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for per-test setup. Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for per-suite resource management.
</Step>
<Step title="Write individual tests inside the suite">
Use `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` or `TEST(SuiteName, TestName)` to write test functions reflecting various scenarios.
</Step>
<Step title="Run all tests">
Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your test program’s `main` function to trigger automatic discovery and execution.
</Step>
<Step title="Filter or disable tests as needed">
Use command line flags to run or exclude tests. Prefix disabled tests or suites with `DISABLED_` for temporary exclusions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Practical Example: Defining a Typed Test Suite

Suppose you want to test multiple container types with the same logic:

```cpp
// Fixture templated on type T
template <typename T>
class ContainerTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  T container;
};

// Define the types you want to test
using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<std::vector<int>, std::list<int>>;

// Associate the fixture and types
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(ContainerTest, MyTypes);

// Typed test using TypeParam
TYPED_TEST(ContainerTest, InitiallyEmpty) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(this->container.empty());
}

TYPED_TEST(ContainerTest, CanAddElements) {
  this->container.push_back(10);
  EXPECT_FALSE(this->container.empty());
}
```

This single source exposes tests for both `std::vector<int>` and `std::list<int>`, maintaining concise and maintainable coverage.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests not discovered or run
- Ensure `InitGoogleTest` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS`.
- Confirm tests use GoogleTest macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`).

### Mixing TEST and TEST_F in same suite
- All tests in a suite must use the same fixture class. Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same suite.

### Disabled tests not running
- They are excluded by default. Use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag to include them.

### No tests linked or selected
- Use `--gtest_fail_if_no_test_linked` or `--gtest_fail_if_no_test_selected` to catch missing or filtered-out tests.

### Test order unexpectedly changed
- GoogleTest randomizes test order by default if `--gtest_shuffle` is specified. Use `--gtest_random_seed` to reproduce order.

## 9. Best Practices for Large Test Suites

- Use descriptive suite and test names following consistent naming conventions.
- Group related tests hierarchically using fixtures and parameterized tests.
- Leverage filtering and sharding for targeted execution and distributed testing.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` judiciously to reduce overhead.

## Callouts

<Note>
Always ensure that your test suite names and test case names do not contain underscores `_` to avoid conflicts and maintain clarity.
</Note>

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_list_tests` to list all discoverable tests without running them, useful for verifying your test organization.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros in the same test suite is illegal. Be sure to keep fixture usage consistent.
</Warning>
