## 2. Common Issues and Solutions

### 2.1 Unexpected Calls and Failing Expectations

**Symptom:** Your test fails because a mock method was called unexpectedly or more times than expected.

**Cause:** Usually, this means your expectations in `EXPECT_CALL` do not match the calls made by the code under test, or you may have missing or incorrect `EXPECT_CALL`s.

**How to Fix:**
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` when running your tests to get detailed tracing of all mock calls and which expectations they match. This will help you pinpoint which calls failed your expectations.
- Ensure you set `EXPECT_CALL` *before* exercising your code.
- If you want to allow calls with any arguments, use a catch-all expectation like `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());` placed before more specific expectations.
- For strict ordering, use `InSequence` or `After` clauses appropriately.

### 2.2 Uninteresting Calls Warning

**Symptom:** Warnings appear such as "Uninteresting mock function call" when a mock method is called without an expectation.

**Cause:** By default, calls to mock methods without any `EXPECT_CALL` produce warnings, as gMock flags them as "uninteresting calls".

**How to Fix:**
- If these calls are expected and you want to silence the warning, wrap your mock type with `NiceMock<YourMock>` to suppress uninteresting call warnings.
- Alternatively, explicitly add an expectation with `.Times(AnyNumber())` for methods that may be called without restrictions.
- Avoid indiscriminately adding `EXPECT_CALL`s without intent, as over-specification leads to brittle tests.

### 2.3 Mock Methods Not Being Called

**Symptom:** You expect a mock method call, but the test reports "expected call never happened".

**Cause:** Possible that the expectation is set incorrectly, or the tested code doesn't invoke the mock method.

**How to Fix:**
- Verify the arguments in your `EXPECT_CALL` match those used in the actual call.
- Check for argument matchers like `_` or `Eq()` to ensure flexibility if exact matches aren’t required.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace calls and confirm whether the mock function is invoked.
- Ensure the mock object remains alive and in scope for the duration of the test.

### 2.4 Compilation Errors with Mock Methods

**Symptom:** Errors related to defining mock methods, especially involving commas in template arguments or const parameters.

**Cause:** C++ macro parsing can fail if types have commas or certain qualifiers.

**How to Fix:**
- Wrap complex types containing commas with extra parentheses in `MOCK_METHOD`. For example, use `MOCK_METHOD((std::pair<bool, int>), GetPair, ());`
- Alternatively, use type aliases to simplify argument or return types.
- Remove redundant top-level `const` qualifiers in method parameters to prevent MSVC warnings (see FAQ section for details).

### 2.5 Unintended Test Failures From Overly Strict Expectations

**Symptom:** A test break after refactoring, despite no external behavior changes.

**Cause:** `Expectations` in gMock are "sticky" and remain active even after being saturated.

**How to Fix:**
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations as soon as they are satisfied.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) when call order matters, so expectations retire automatically after subsequent expectations fire.
- For multiple calls with different behaviors, use chained `.WillOnce()` followed by `.WillRepeatedly()`.

### 2.6 Issues with Mocking Move-Only Types

**Symptom:** Compilation errors or runtime problems when mocking methods with arguments or return types that are move-only (e.g. `std::unique_ptr`).

**Cause:** Older gMock versions or some actions may lack support for move-only types.

**How to Fix:**
- Use `MOCK_METHOD` macro normally; it supports move-only types if your gMock version is current.
- For return values, specify lambdas or functors inside `.WillOnce()` or `.WillRepeatedly()` that create and return new instances on each call.
- For arguments, ensure you handle move semantics correctly in your mock setup.
- If issues persist, consider defining helper methods forwarding calls, as a workaround.

## 3. Best Practices for Troubleshooting

- **Enable Verbose Logging:** Running tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` is your first diagnostic tool. It shows the matching between calls and expectations and stack traces.

- **Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` Appropriately:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress noisy warnings for uninteresting calls, `StrictMock` to fail fast on unexpected calls.

- **Explicit Expectations:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expectations rather than relying only on `ON_CALL` which sets behaviors but not expectations.

- **Check Ordering and Call Counts:** Use `InSequence`, `After`, and `Times()` to specify call order and repetition explicitly.

- **Verify and Clear Expectations:** When you suspect lingering state issues in mocks, use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` to check and reset expectations manually.

- **Heap Check for Leak Detection:** Be mindful that mocks allocated on the heap must be properly destroyed to verify expectations.

- **Watch for Overlapping Expectations:** Remember newer `EXPECT_CALL`s take precedence and may shadow earlier ones, so order matters.

- **Mock Method Qualifiers:** Ensure your mocks declare const, override, and other qualifiers correctly to avoid mismatches.

- **Use Type Aliases to Simplify Macros:** Complex types in `MOCK_METHOD` declarations should be simplified with using statements to avoid macro parsing errors.

## 4. Troubleshooting Checklist

### Diagnosing Failing Mock Expectations
- Are all `EXPECT_CALL`s specified before the mock is used?
- Did you specify argument matchers correctly to align with how the code calls the mock?
- Run with `--gmock_verbose=info` and inspect output to see which expectations match (or fail to match).

### Addressing Unexpected or Uninteresting Calls
- If irrelevant calls cause warning noise, consider using `NiceMock`.
- For genuine unexpected calls, add expectations or fix the call sites.
- Use `StrictMock` to enforce stricter checking for test correctness.

### Resolving Compilation Issues
- Wrap types with commas in `MOCK_METHOD` using parentheses or type aliases.
- Remove top-level `const` in parameters for MSVC compiler compatibility.

### Debugging Test Failures Due to Call Ordering
- Use `InSequence` to ensure strict call order.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid sticky expectations causing overflow errors.

### Verifying Mock State Explicitly
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(mock)` to check if all expectations are met before test completion, especially for heap-allocated mocks.

### Handling Move-Only or Complex Types
- Return new instances from `.WillRepeatedly()` via lambdas.
- Define forwarding helpers if mocking does not compile directly.

## 5. Additional FAQ Highlights

### Q: Can I mock non-virtual or static functions?
A: No, gMock requires virtual methods for mocking. To mock static or free functions, wrap them in an interface and mock the interface.

### Q: How do I mock overloaded methods?
A: Define separate mocks for each overload using `MOCK_METHOD` with complete signatures. Use `Const()` wrapper for const overload visibility.

### Q: When should I use `ON_CALL` vs `EXPECT_CALL`?
A: Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors without expectation of call frequency. Use `EXPECT_CALL` when you care about the call count or order.

### Q: Why do I get too many warnings about uninteresting calls?
A: By default, uninteresting calls generate warnings. Use `NiceMock` to suppress these warnings during normal test runs.

### Q: How to delete mock objects safely in actions?
A: Use predefined actions like `Delete` or call deletion inside custom actions carefully to avoid dangling pointers or deadlocks.
