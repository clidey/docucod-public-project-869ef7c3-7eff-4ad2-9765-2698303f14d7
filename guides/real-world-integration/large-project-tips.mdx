# Scaling and Optimizing Large Test Suites

## Overview

This guide covers effective strategies for managing and optimizing large test suites in GoogleTest. It focuses on techniques such as test sharding, parallel execution, and best practices to ensure fast feedback cycles. Additionally, it explains advanced configuration options using environment variables and flags to tailor test execution for speed and scalability.

---

## 1. Managing Large Test Suites

### What You Will Achieve
By applying the recommendations in this guide, you will be able to:

- Run very large collections of tests more quickly and reliably.
- Minimize test execution time by distributing tests efficiently.
- Configure GoogleTest to shard tests across multiple machines or processors.
- Use flags and environment variables to customize test runs for optimal performance.

### Prerequisites
- A test suite using GoogleTest macros (`TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, etc.).
- Familiarity with writing and running tests as covered in the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md).
- GoogleTest compiled with support for multi-threading, if parallelism is desired.

## 2. Strategies for Scaling Test Execution

### 2.1 Test Sharding
GoogleTest supports test sharding to distribute your tests over multiple shards, such as machines or processes, enabling parallel execution and faster overall completion.

#### How Sharding Works:
- Set the environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` before starting your test program.
- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` indicates the total number of shards.
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` specifies the index of the current shard, ranging from 0 to `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS - 1`.

GoogleTest automatically partitions the tests among shards so that each test is run exactly once across all shards.

##### Example Sharding Setup:

```bash
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2
./your_test_binary
```
This runs shard 2 of 4.

##### Expected Behavior:
- Each shard runs a subset of tests.
- Aggregating results from all shards gives the complete test coverage.

<Check>
Ensure that all shards use the same total shard count and have unique indices.
</Check>

### 2.2 Running Tests in Parallel

Running tests concurrently within one machine can drastically reduce test time.

#### How to Enable Parallel Tests:
- This depends on your build infrastructure or test invocation tool since GoogleTest itself does not provide built-in parallel execution within a single process.
- Use external test runners like `bazel`, `ctest` (through CMake), or custom scripts to launch multiple instances of your test binary with different shard indexes.

<Tip>
Utilize the `--gtest_filter` flag to manually select subsets of tests if needed for custom parallel runs.
</Tip>

### 2.3 Fast Feedback Best Practices

- Group fast-running tests separately from integration or long-running tests.
- Regularly run critical test shards on commit or pull-request triggers.
- Disable or isolate flaky or slow tests to prevent blocking the entire suite.
- Monitor test execution durations to identify candidates for optimization or parallelization.

## 3. Advanced Configuration: Environment Variables and Flags

GoogleTest offers environment variables and command-line flags that can be combined with sharding and parallelization for granular control.

### Key Environment Variables and Flags

| Variable / Flag                | Purpose                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`          | Total number of shards for test sharding.                     |
| `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`           | Index of the current shard (0-based).                         |
| `GTEST_FILTER`                | Runs a subset of tests by name pattern filter.                 |
| `GTEST_REPEAT`                | Repeats tests multiple times (can help detect flaky tests).   |
| `GTEST_SHUFFLE`               | Randomizes test order to find order dependencies.             |
| `GTEST_RANDOM_SEED`           | Sets reproducible seed for shuffling.                         |
| `GTEST_FAIL_FAST`             | Stops test execution upon first failure.                       |

### Usage Examples
- Running only tests matching a pattern:

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_filter=FooTest.*
```

- Running tests multiple times (e.g., 100 iterations to catch flakes):

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_repeat=100
```

- Running tests with shuffling (random order):

```bash
./test_binary --gtest_shuffle --gtest_random_seed=42
```

<Note>
When specifying both environment variables and flags, command-line options override environment variables.
</Note>

## 4. Verifying Proper Shard Execution

It is critical to confirm that your sharded test runs cover all tests exactly once.

### How to Verify:

- After a sharded run, collect logs from all shards.
- Ensure that the union of all test runs matches the full suite, with no overlaps.
- Use the XML or JSON report outputs (`--gtest_output=xml:<file>` or `--gtest_output=json:<file>`) to audit test coverage.

### Tips:

- Employ automated scripts or CI integrations to merge and validate reports.
- Use consistent `GTEST_RANDOM_SEED` when combining sharding with shuffling for reproducibility.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Test Not Running in Sharded Environment">
Verify that both the `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` variables are set and valid integers within appropriate ranges. Missing or invalid values result in all tests running without sharding.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Coverage Overlap or Missing Tests">
Check that each shard has a unique index and that the total shards count matches across all shards. Running inconsistent values causes tests to run multiple times or be skipped unintentionally.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow Test Execution Despite Sharding">
- Confirm tests are evenly balanced across shards.
- Identify tests with large runtime that may bottleneck individual shards.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize execution order and identify dependencies causing slowdowns.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flaky Tests in Parallel Runs">
- Use the `--gtest_repeat` flag on individual shards to reproduce flakes.
- Isolate flaky tests into separate shards or disable them temporarily.
- Investigate shared state or race conditions that occur during parallel execution.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Summary

Effectively scaling your GoogleTest test suites is vital to reducing feedback loops and improving development velocity. Using sharding, parallel execution orchestrated by your CI/build system, and fine-tuning with flags and environment variables ensures your large suite runs efficiently and reliably.

For best results:
- Distribute tests evenly across shards.
- Use filters and repetition to catch flaky tests.
- Continuously monitor and optimize test durations.
