# Test Automation in CI/CD Pipelines

## Overview

This guide provides best practices for running GoogleTest-based test suites automatically within continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) environments. It focuses on configuring test discovery, managing result reporting, and minimizing flaky tests in automated pipelines to maintain a reliable and effective testing workflow.

Automating your tests in CI/CD helps catch issues early, maintain code quality, and deliver stable software more confidently.

---

## Prerequisites

Before automating your GoogleTest suites in CI/CD, ensure you have:

- A GoogleTest-based test binary that runs correctly on your local machine.
- Your build system properly configured to build the test binaries.
- Access to your CI/CD platform where tests will be integrated.
- Basic familiarity with running tests manually and interpreting GoogleTest results.

For setup and build instructions, see the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and [Integrating with Build Systems](guides/real-world-integration/integrating-into-builds).

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will:

- Configure automated test discovery in your CI environment.
- Set up structured test result reporting for clear pass/fail feedback.
- Apply strategies to reduce test flakiness and improve reliability.

This setup will enable automated verification of your C++ codebase with GoogleTest as part of your development pipeline.

## Time Estimate

Setting up GoogleTest automation in a CI/CD pipeline ranges from **30 minutes to a few hours**, depending on your existing build and CI infrastructure.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your Test Binary for CI

1. **Ensure tests build and run standalone:**
   - Your test executable should build without manual steps.
   - Running the binary directly should execute all tests, returning an exit code of `0` on success and non-zero on failure.
   - Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` as the main test entry point to maintain consistency.

2. **Enable XML test output:**
   - GoogleTest supports outputting results in JUnit-compatible XML format.
   - In your CI runs, invoke the test binary with the flag:

   ```bash
   ./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:<output_file.xml>
   ```

   - This XML can be consumed by most CI servers for reporting.

3. **Handle test filtering:**
   - You can run a subset of tests using `--gtest_filter=`. For example:

   ```bash
   ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*
   ```

   - This is useful for focused runs, but CI should default to running all tests.


### 2. Configure the CI Build System

1. **Build your tests as part of CI:**
   - Your CI script/build step should build the test executable using your usual build tool (e.g., CMake, Bazel).

2. **Run the test executable:**
   - After building, execute your test binary with XML output enabled.
   - Capture the output XML to a known location for the CI server.

3. **Integrate test result reporting:**
   - Most CI systems (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.) support importing JUnit XML reports.
   - Configure your CI system to consume `<output_file.xml>` produced by GoogleTest.

### 3. Minimize Test Flakiness in CI

Flaky tests undermine trust in CI results. Follow these tips:

- **Isolate tests:** Ensure tests do not depend on shared state or external factors. GoogleTest runs each test with a fresh fixture instance.

- **Avoid ordering dependencies:** Do not rely on test order. GoogleTest runs tests in an unspecified order by default.

- **Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` carefully:** Clean up all resources to avoid side effects between tests.

- **Handle timing and concurrency:** When testing asynchronous code, use appropriate synchronization to avoid race conditions.

- **Use stable test data:** Avoid depending on non-deterministic input or environmental data.

- **Rerun flaky tests cautiously:** If your CI permits, consider rerunning failed tests a limited number of times, but fix flakes promptly.

### 4. Advanced: Parallel and Sharded Test Runs

To speed up test execution:

- Use external tools like [gtest-parallel](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) to run tests concurrently.
- Split tests into shards by filtering subsets and running them on different agents.
- Ensure each shard produces independent XML reports that your CI system can aggregate.

### 5. Troubleshooting Common CI Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting CI Test Automation">
<Accordion title="Tests do not run or no tests found">
- Verify that your tests are registered with GoogleTest (using `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros).
- Confirm `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in your `main()`.
- Check if test binaries execute correctly outside CI.
- Ensure the test discovery step (like `gtest_discover_tests` in CMake) is working.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test output XML not generating or malformed">
- Confirm `--gtest_output=xml:<path>` flag is correct.
- Validate file system permissions in CI workspace.
- Check for test binary crash before XML output.
- Ensure exit codes propagate properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flaky or inconsistent test failures">
- Review test code for shared state or timing dependencies.
- Add logging or `SCOPED_TRACE` for debugging.
- Run tests multiple times locally with random seeds (`--gtest_random_seed=<value>`).
- Consider isolating or skipping flaky tests temporarily.
</Accordion>

## Sample CI Integration Snippet (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
name: C++ GoogleTest CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up CMake
      uses: lukka/get-cmake@v3
    - name: Configure Build
      run: |
        cmake -S . -B build
    - name: Build Tests
      run: |
        cmake --build build --target all
    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        ./build/your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml:test_results.xml
    - name: Upload Test Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: test_results.xml
```

This workflow builds your project using CMake, runs tests with XML output, and uploads the results as an artifact.

## Best Practices Summary

- Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from `main()` to ensure the correct exit code.
- Use XML output for structured CI reporting.
- Group related tests into test suites and fixtures for better organization.
- Avoid dependencies and side effects between tests.
- Use CI flags to rerun failing tests only if necessary, but aim to fix flakiness.
- Document your CI configuration alongside your code base.
