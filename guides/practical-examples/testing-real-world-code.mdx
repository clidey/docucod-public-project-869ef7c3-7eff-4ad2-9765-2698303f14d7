# Testing Real-World Code: End-to-End Walkthrough

## Workflow Overview

### Purpose
This guide leads you through a realistic, end-to-end testing workflow for a C++ component using GoogleTest. You will start by writing basic tests to validate simple behavior and progressively move on to introduce test fixtures for shared setups, culminating with applying mock objects to effectively isolate dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- A working GoogleTest setup integrated into your C++ project.
- Familiarity with C++ and basic GoogleTest concepts such as `TEST()`.
- Access to GoogleTest headers and libraries.

### Outcome
By the end of this walkthrough, you will have written well-structured, maintainable tests for a non-trivial component. You will understand how to organize tests logically, reuse setup code across tests, and mock dependencies to keep tests focused and fast.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30-45 minutes, including reading and hands-on coding.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate â€” assumes you know C++ and basic testing, but new to advanced test organization and mocking patterns.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Write Basic Tests Using `TEST()`

Start by writing simple, independent tests that check fundamental behaviors of the component.

1. Define test functions using the `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro.
2. Use GoogleTest assertions like `EXPECT_EQ()` to verify expected outputs.
3. Make your test names descriptive and clear.

**Example:** For a function `int Factorial(int n)`: 
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

**Expected Result:** Each test executes independently, verifying specific inputs.

---

### Step 2: Use Test Fixtures (`TEST_F`) for Shared Setup

When multiple tests need to work with the same initial data or object setup:

1. Create a fixture class by deriving from `testing::Test`.
2. Define shared setup in the fixture constructor or the `SetUp()` method.
3. Use `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` to access this prepared environment.

**Example:** For testing a queue class:
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
     q1_.Enqueue(1);
     q2_.Enqueue(2);
     q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_, q1_, q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

**Expected Result:** Fresh fixture instance for each test ensures isolation and safe reuse of resources.

---

### Step 3: Introduce Mock Objects to Isolate Dependencies

For components that interact with other modules or external resources:

1. Define mock classes inheriting from the dependencies using GoogleMock.
2. Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to mock methods.
3. In your tests, set expectations on mock methods with `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising the component.
4. This allows you to verify interactions and control mock behavior.

**Note:** Detailed mock class definition and usage are covered in the mocking guides.

---

### Step 4: Organize and Run Your Tests

1. Group related tests into test suites with meaningful names.
2. Build your test binary, ensuring linkage to the GoogleTest libraries.
3. Run your tests using the test runner executable.
4. Review test output for passes, failures, and failure details.

**Tip:** Use `--gtest_filter` to run specific test suites or tests during development.

---

### Step 5: Iterate and Refine

Review failing tests, add assertions, introduce additional fixtures or mocks, and refine your test logic to improve coverage and robustness.

## Practical Example Walkthrough

Consider testing a `Queue` class that enqueues and dequeues integer elements.

1. **Simple `TEST`:** Check that a newly created `Queue` is empty.

```cpp
TEST(QueueBasicTest, EmptyInitially) {
  Queue<int> q;
  EXPECT_EQ(q.size(), 0);
}
```

2. **Using Fixture:** Set up three queues with varying states.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }
  Queue<int> q0_, q1_, q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

3. **Mocking Dependencies:**

Suppose `Queue` depends on an external `Notifier` interface to signal queue state changes:

```cpp
class MockNotifier : public Notifier {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Notify, (), (override));
};
```

Inject `MockNotifier` into `Queue` and set expectations:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, NotifiesOnEnqueue) {
  MockNotifier mock_notifier;
  Queue<int> queue_with_notifier(&mock_notifier);

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_notifier, Notify()).Times(1);

  queue_with_notifier.Enqueue(42);
}
```

This test verifies the interaction without requiring a real notifier.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Tests not running:** Ensure tests are linked correctly and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()`.
- **Fixture errors:** Check the fixture class has a default constructor.
- **Mock failures:** Verify `EXPECT_CALL`s match actual calls; unmatched expectations cause failures.
- **Test order dependencies:** Avoid tests that rely on order or shared mutable state.

### Best Practices

- Use descriptive test and fixture names.
- Keep tests independent and atomic.
- Use fixtures to minimize duplicate setup code.
- Mock external dependencies to speed up tests and isolate issues.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*` unless further execution is meaningless after failure.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context when testing complex scenarios.

### Performance Considerations

- Avoid expensive or flaky setup in `SetUp()`. Use `SetUpTestSuite()` for shared costly setup.
- Mock heavy external dependencies to keep tests fast.

### Alternative Approaches

- Use parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) for repeated tests over multiple inputs.
- Use typed or type-parameterized tests for common behavior verification across types.
