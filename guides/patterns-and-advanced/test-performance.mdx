# Optimizing Test Performance and Scalability

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide powerful tools not only for correctness, but also for maintaining *fast*, *reliable*, and *scalable* test suites as projects grow. This guide focuses specifically on proven techniques and practical tips to optimize the speed, maintainability, and robustness of your test codebase through targeted execution, resilience to flaky tests, and smooth integration with popular build tools like CMake and Bazel.

---

## 1. Why Optimize Test Performance?

As your test suite grows, unchecked runtime and maintenance costs can slow down development. Each test should run quickly and reliably so you can get fast feedback. Optimized tests unlock the full productivity benefits of test-driven development and continuous integration.

*Better test performance leads to:*
- **Faster development cycles** with immediate feedback on code changes
- **Improved test reliability**, reducing flaky test noise
- **Smoother integration** in automated build and CI pipelines
- **Maintainable test code** that scales with project complexity

---

## 2. Efficient Test Execution Practices

### 2.1 Targeted Test Runs

Avoid running your entire test suite unnecessarily. Instead, focus tests where they matter:

- **Run only affected tests:** Use tools or build system support (such as Bazel or CMake) to run tests relevant to modified source files.
- **Filter tests:** Use command-line options to `--gtest_filter` tests by name patterns, class, or test suite.
- **Parallelize:** Leverage GoogleTest's `--gtest_parallel` or your build system's parallel execution to utilize multiple CPU cores.

**Example:**
```bash
# Run all tests in the foo_test suite
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=FooTest.*

# Run tests matching a substring
./my_test_executable --gtest_filter=*Critical*
```

### 2.2 Selective Mocking

- Mock only dependencies relevant to the test scenario to keep tests lightweight.
- Avoid over-mocking which leads to brittle tests.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls when full coverage isn't needed.

<Tip>
Use `EXPECT_CALL` selectively to specify strict behavior and use `ON_CALL` for default answers where precise call counts don’t matter.
</Tip>

### 2.3 Mock Scope and Lifetime

- Keep mocks tightly scoped to test lifetimes to avoid leaks and dangling expectations.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to forcibly verify mocks before destruction when ownership is complex.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` cautiously when intentional.

---

## 3. Writing Maintainable and Flake-Resistant Tests

### 3.1 Avoid Overly Strict Expectations

- Overly constrained calls or call counts make tests fragile.
- Prefer cardinalities like `Times(AtLeast(n))`, `Times(AnyNumber())` where exact counts are irrelevant.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire saturated expectations automatically, preventing conflicts.

### 3.2 Order Expectations Intelligently

- Only enforce strict call order when necessary via `InSequence` or `After` clauses.
- For independent calls, avoid ordering to reduce brittleness.

### 3.3 Avoid Side Effects in Matchers and Actions

- Matchers must be purely functional with no side effects.
- Actions should not modify mutable external state accidentally across calls unless explicitly intended.

### 3.4 Control Default Actions

- Use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior for mocks to prevent unexpected call failures.
- Use GoogleMock's verbosity flags (e.g., `--gmock_verbose=warning`) to monitor unexpected or uninteresting calls.

### 3.5 Managing Flaky Tests

- Isolate flaky tests and fix root causes (e.g. time dependencies, randomization).
- Use retry or timeout mechanisms provided by external tools if necessary.

---

## 4. Integration with Build Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support seamless integration with popular build tools, enabling optimized test runs and scalable workflows.

### 4.1 CMake

- Use the bundled `FindGTest` or modern GoogleTest targets.
- Define test executables with proper include directories and link against `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` for auto main().
- Enable test parallelization via `ctest` options.

**Example CMake snippet:**
```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cc mock_foo.cc foo_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gmock_main)
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

### 4.2 Bazel

- Use `cc_test` rules with `googletest` and `gmock` dependencies.
- Take advantage of Bazel’s test caching and selective execution to run incremental tests only.
- Use Bazel's parallel test execution support for fast large-scale test runs.

**Example BUILD snippet:**
```starlark
cc_test(
    name = "foo_test",
    srcs = ["foo_test.cc", "mock_foo.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main"],
)
```

## 5. Best Practices Summary

- **Plan test scope:** write focused, fast tests with minimal dependencies
- **Set expectations wisely:** prefer default actions with `ON_CALL` and minimal no. of `EXPECT_CALL`
- **Use sequences and ordering sparingly:** only enforce call order when behavior requires it
- **Use mock wrappers:** `NiceMock` for relaxed warnings, `StrictMock` for catching unexpected calls
- **Control test run:** filter, parallelize, and target tests through build tools or command line
- **Clean mocks properly:** verify and clear expectations, avoid leaks
- **Monitor test output:** use verbosity flags such as `--gmock_verbose` for diagnostics

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Performance and Scalability Issues

### 6.1 Slow Test Runs

- Check for expensive setups or teardowns.
- Ensure tests avoid unnecessary I/O or network calls.
- Use mock objects instead of real dependencies where possible.
- Run tests in parallel.

### 6.2 Flaky Tests

- Investigate external dependencies causing intermittent failures.
- Fix or isolate timing issues.
- Avoid globals and shared states.

### 6.3 Leaked Mocks and Incomplete Verification

- Always ensure mocks are deleted or call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations`.
- Use heap checking tools.

---

## 7. Additional Tips

- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` during debugging to see detailed call matching and expectation traces.
- Group related expectations with `InSequence` or `After` to clarify ordering constraints.
- Prefer lambdas and existing callables for custom actions over writing complex action classes.
- Leverage GoogleMock's extensive rich matchers to keep argument matching expressive and simple.
