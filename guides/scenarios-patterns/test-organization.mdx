# Organizing and Structuring Tests

Efficient test organization is fundamental to maintaining a scalable and maintainable C++ test suite. GoogleTest provides powerful features to help structure your tests with clarity, reusability, and precisionâ€”covering simple tests, fixtures, parameterized testing, and typed tests.

---

## 1. Why Organize Tests?

Tests should reflect the design and logic of the codebase they verify. Proper organization helps:

- Isolate failures for quick diagnosis.
- Group related tests logically.
- Share setup and teardown code efficiently.
- Support a scalable test suite that grows with your project.

## 2. Test Suites and Test Names

Each group of related tests belongs to a *Test Suite* (previously called Test Case). Test names within each suite should be descriptive and follow these guidelines:

- Use valid C++ identifiers without underscores (`_`). GoogleTest reserves underscores for internal purposes, and avoiding them prevents naming collisions and future compatibility issues.
- Keep test suite names consistent with the class or module under test for easy identification.
- Avoid mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros in the same test suite. Mixing fixtures and non-fixture tests in the same suite is illegal and triggers runtime errors.


## 3. Using Fixtures for Shared Setup

When multiple tests require the same setup or common data, use a *test fixture* class:

- Derive a fixture class from `testing::Test`.
- Define shared data members and setup/cleanup methods.
- Use `TEST_F()` macro instead of `TEST()` to associate tests with the fixture.

### Benefits of Fixtures:

- Each test runs on a fresh fixture instance, isolating state.
- Setup and cleanup logic is centralized.
- Encapsulates common code and data reuse without globals.

### Example:
```cpp
class MyClassTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource;
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    delete shared_resource_;
  }

  Resource* shared_resource_;
};

TEST_F(MyClassTest, TestFeatureA) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_resource_->DoA());
}

TEST_F(MyClassTest, TestFeatureB) {
  EXPECT_EQ(42, shared_resource_->GetValue());
}
```

## 4. Per-Test Suite Setup and Tear Down

Sometimes setup/teardown is expensive and shared across tests. GoogleTest supports *per-test-suite* initialization:

- Define static methods: `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` in your fixture.
- Use static or static pointer variables to hold shared resources.
- GoogleTest calls these methods once per test suite execution, before the first and after the last test.

### Example:
```cpp
class SharedStateTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource;
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }
  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};

Resource* SharedStateTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(SharedStateTest, Test1) {
  ASSERT_NE(shared_resource_, nullptr);
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_resource_->IsReady());
}
```

## 5. Parameterized Tests

When you want to test the same logic with different inputs or configurations, *value-parameterized tests* are ideal. They avoid duplicated code and improve coverage.

### How to Use Parameterized Tests:

1. Define a fixture derived from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is your parameter type.
2. Write tests using `TEST_P()` macro inside this fixture.
3. Instantiate the tests with sets of parameters using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### Example:
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesVariousInputs) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GE(Factorial(n), 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ValidValues, FactorialTest, testing::Values(0, 1, 5, 10));
```

### Parameter Generators:
GoogleTest provides several convenient generators:
- `Values(v1, v2, ..., vN)`: enumerates explicit values.
- `ValuesIn(container)`: from arrays or containers.
- `Range(begin, end [, step])`: incremental sequences.
- `Bool()`: generates false and true.
- `Combine(g1, g2, ..., gN)`: Cartesian product of generators.

### Naming Parameterized Tests

You can specify custom names for each test instance, making output easier to interpret:
```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    ParamSet, FactorialTest, testing::Values(0, 1, 5),
    [](const testing::TestParamInfo<int>& info) {
      return "Value" + std::to_string(info.param);
    });
```

### Common Tips:
- Always declare `SetUpTestSuite()` as `public` if your fixture uses `TEST_P()`.
- Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(FixtureName);` to suppress errors if parameterized tests lack instantiations.

## 6. Typed Tests

Typed tests let you run the same test logic against several types:

- Define a fixture class template parameterized by a type `T`.
- Provide a list of types to test using `testing::Types`.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` to attach types to the fixture.
- Define tests with `TYPED_TEST()` macro.

### Example:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class NumberTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_ = T();  // Default constructed value
};

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, double, float>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumberTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumberTest, IsDefaultZero) {
  TypeParam zero = static_cast<TypeParam>(0);
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, zero);
}
```

## 7. Type-Parameterized Tests (Advanced)

Type-parameterized tests are similar to typed tests but allow defining test templates without assigning specific types upfront. They require explicit registration and instantiation.

- Define fixture template.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P` macros.
- Register test names with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Instantiate using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

This pattern is ideal for test libraries that want others to instantiate tests with their own types.

## 8. Test Naming Best Practices

- Use descriptive, unique names for both suites and tests.
- Avoid underscores `_` in names to prevent macro conflicts.
- For parameterized tests, provide meaningful test name suffixes.
- Keep the naming consistent with code semantics.

## 9. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` within the same test suite.
- Having multiple fixture classes with the same test suite name across namespaces or translation units.
- Ignoring the naming restrictions on underscores.
- Forgetting to instantiate parameterized tests.

## 10. Advanced Structure Example

```cpp
// Define a fixture
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Setup queues
  }
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

// Basic tests
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, EnqueueWorks) {
  q1_.Enqueue(1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 1);
}

// Parameterized test for different container types
class ContainerTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};
TEST_P(ContainerTest, PerformsWork) {
  std::string container_type = GetParam();
  // ... test logic based on container_type
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ContainerTests, ContainerTest,
                         testing::Values("Vector", "List", "Deque"));

// Typed tests for different numeric types
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {};
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, testing::Types<int, double>);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, IsZeroOnInit) {
  TypeParam val{};
  EXPECT_EQ(val, 0);
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Issue**: Mixing `TEST_F` and `TEST` in the same suite causes runtime failures.
  **Solution**: Separate tests into different test suites or unify their fixture usage.

- **Issue**: Parameterized tests produce no tests.
  **Solution**: Ensure instantiation is performed; add `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` if needed.

- **Tip**: Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add helpful context inside helper functions used in multiple tests.

- **Tip**: For expensive shared resources, leverage `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` to minimize overhead.

- **Tip**: Avoid underscores in test and suite names to prevent macro and linking issues.

- **Tip**: Use test name filters `--gtest_filter` with parameterized test suffixes to run targeted tests.
