# Mastering Core Assertions & Matchers

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide provides a comprehensive deep dive into the powerful assertion macros of GoogleTest and the expressive matchers of GoogleMock. It empowers you to write intent-driven, readable, and robust tests by mastering how to assert values, match arguments, and handle test validations effectively.

### Prerequisites
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed and configured in your C++ project.
- Basic understanding of writing tests with GoogleTest.
- Familiarity with mock objects and setting expectations (recommended to have read the Getting Started guides).

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will be able to:
- Use a wide range of assertion macros for verifying different conditions.
- Employ matchers effectively to match function arguments in mocks.
- Understand how to combine matchers for complex validations.
- Create more descriptive and maintainable test cases.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 30 to 45 minutes depending on familiarity.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to Advanced

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Using GoogleTest Assertion Macros

Start by selecting the right assertion macro based on what you want to verify:

- **Boolean Conditions:**
  - `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` — Assert *condition* is true.
  - `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` — Assert *condition* is false.

- **Binary Comparisons:**
  Use these for comparing values with operators:
  - `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Expect equality (`==`).
  - `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)` — Expect inequality (`!=`).
  - Relational Comparisons: `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE` for `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` respectively.

- **String Comparisons:**
  Use `EXPECT_STREQ` and variants for comparing C-style strings by content.

- **Floating Point Comparisons:**
  For approximate comparisons, use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` with customizable tolerance.

- **Exception Assertions:**
  Check your code throws or does not throw exceptions:
  - `EXPECT_THROW(stmt, exception_type)`
  - `EXPECT_NO_THROW(stmt)`

- **Predicate Assertions:**
  Use `EXPECT_PREDn` and `EXPECT_PRED_FORMATn` to assert custom predicate functions with up to 5 arguments.

- **Explicit Success and Failure:**
  For custom control flow:
  - `SUCCEED()` marks a success explicitly.
  - `FAIL()` marks a fatal failure.
  - `ADD_FAILURE()` adds a non-fatal failure.

#### How to use
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(calculated_value, expected_value) << "Custom failure message";
ASSERT_TRUE(IsValid(input));
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionThatThrows(), std::runtime_error);
```

### 2. Employing GoogleMock Matchers

Matchers enhance assertions by allowing flexible, readable argument verifications within mock objects.

- **Basic Matchers:**
  - `_` wildcard matches anything.
  - `Eq(value)` matches exact equality.
  - `Ne(value)` matches inequality.
  - Relational: `Lt()`, `Le()`, `Gt()`, `Ge()`.

- **Composite Matchers:**
  Combine matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`.

- **Advanced Matchers:**
  - `Field(&Class::member, matcher)`: Match an object's member.
  - `Property(&Class::method, matcher)`: Match a getter method's return.
  - `Pointee(matcher)`: Matches value pointed to by pointer/smart pointer with `matcher`.

- **Using Matchers with EXPECT_CALL:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(Lt(5), Eq("test")));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(_)).WillOnce(Return(true));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(Field(&Bar::x, Gt(0))));
```

- **Matching Multiple Arguments as a Whole:**
  Use `.With()` to specify multi-argument conditions:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Func(_, _)).With(Lt());  // First argument less than second
```

- **Writing Custom Matchers:**
  Use `MATCHER` macros for new matchers when existing ones don’t meet your needs.

### 3. Managing Expectation Behavior

- **Ordering:**
  Use `InSequence` to enforce call order or `After` for partial ordering.

- **Times Clause:**
  Specify how many times a call is expected:
  - `Times(n)`, `Times(AnyNumber())`, `Times(AtLeast(1))`, etc.

- **Actions:**
  Specify behavior:
  - `.WillOnce(action)` for single calls
  - `.WillRepeatedly(action)` for repeated calls

- **Retiring Expectations:**
  Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after hitting limits.

### 4. Writing Readable, Intent-Driven Tests

- Use expressive matchers instead of raw values for clarity.
- Combine matchers logically to capture intent rather than exact details.
- Add custom failure messages to assertions for faster diagnosis.
- Use `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` for flexible assertions.

### 5. Verification and Troubleshooting

- Mock objects automatically verify expectations at destruction.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` to explicitly verify early.
- Increase verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed call trace.
- Common pitfalls:
  - Missing an `EXPECT_CALL` leading to uninteresting call warnings.
  - Overlapping expectations shadowing each other.
  - Mismatched argument types—use `SafeMatcherCast` if needed.

## Examples & Code Samples

### Basic Assertions
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(sum, 42) << "Sum should be 42";
ASSERT_TRUE(IsValid(user)) << "User is invalid";
EXPECT_THROW(DangerousOp(), std::exception);
```

### Using Matchers in EXPECT_CALL
```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockCalculator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), (override));
};

MockCalculator mock_calc;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_calc, Add(Gt(0), _))  // First arg > 0, second arg anything
    .WillOnce(Return(100));
```

### Combining Matchers
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(AllOf(Field(&Obj::val, Eq(10)), Pointee(Gt(0)))))
    .Times(2);
```
This expects calls where the object's `val` member equals 10, and pointer argument points to a value greater than 0.

### Complex Action Example
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(_))
    .WillOnce([](int x) { return x * 2; })
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));
```
This returns double the input once, then 42 for all subsequent calls.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Failure to match expectations:** Run with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see which expectation matched.
- **Uninteresting call warnings:** You forgot to specify `EXPECT_CALL` for a method that got called. Consider if you want to suppress warnings with `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.
- **Ambiguous overloads:** Use `Const(mock)` or explicit argument matchers to resolve.
- **Return values missing:** Provide default actions with `ON_CALL` or specify actions in expectations.

### Best Practices
- Prefer `ON_CALL` to set behavior without strict expectations; use `EXPECT_CALL` to enforce.
- Minimize `EXPECT_CALL`s to only what you want to verify to avoid brittle tests.
- Combine matchers logically with `AllOf`/`AnyOf` to express intent clearly.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make sequences or repeated calls more flexible.
- Overload mocks thoughtfully to prevent compiler ambiguities.

### Performance
- Keep mock classes focused to limit compile time.
- Define heavy mock class constructors/destructors out-of-line for faster compilation.

### Alternative Approaches
- Use `MockFunction` to mock `std::function` callbacks.
- Create custom matchers and actions for domain-specific validations.
