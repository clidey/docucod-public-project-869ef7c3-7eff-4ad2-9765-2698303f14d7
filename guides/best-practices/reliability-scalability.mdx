# Reliable and Scalable Testing

GoogleMock empowers you to create robust, maintainable test suites that stand the test of complexity, scale, and evolving codebases. This guide focuses on strategies to craft tests that are clear, modular, and resistant to brittleness, enabling you to confidently verify behavior even as your code grows.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Objective
Help you design and organize test suites in ways that promote reliability and scalability. You'll learn best practices around modular tests, test organization, avoiding flaky tests, and handling large codebases efficiently.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with basic GoogleMock usage (mock classes, `EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL`)
- Basic understanding of test suite structures

### Outcome
By following this guidance, you will be able to:
- Structure test code to minimize duplication and improve clarity
- Design tests that are less flaky and easier to maintain
- Utilize GoogleMock features effectively to specify call expectations with appropriate constraints
- Scale your mocking strategy to large projects without compromising test stability

### Time Commitment
Reading and applying guidelines may take 30 minutes to an hour depending on your current test coverage and code size.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate (users should be comfortable with basic mocking and test writing)

---

## 2. Designing Reliable and Scalable Test Suites

### 2.1 Emphasize Test Modularity

Separate concerns by clearly scoping each test to one behavior or contract. Avoid large, monolithic test functions that mix many behaviors.

- **Use Mock Classes Strategically:** Define mock classes with clear purpose. Keep `MOCK_METHOD` declarations public, regardless of base class access, to allow flexible expectations.
- **Delegate Complex Setup:** Use test fixtures or helper methods to reduce repeated setup code.

Example:
```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Query, (const std::string& query), (override));
};
```

Keep actions simple and understandable for each test.

---

### 2.2 Structured Organization of Tests

Organize your tests hierarchically using:

- **Test Suites and Fixtures:** Group related tests.
- **Sequences:** Use `::testing::Sequence` or `InSequence` scopes to enforce call order when needed.
- **Expectations with Cardinality:** Set `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()` accurately to specify allowed call counts and behaviors.

Example sequence to ensure order:
```cpp
Sequence s;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Initialize()).InSequence(s);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process()).InSequence(s);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Finalize()).InSequence(s);
```

---

### 2.3 Preventing Flaky Tests

Tests fail intermittently due to timing, state bleed, or overconstrained expectations.

**To avoid this:**

- Prefer `ON_CALL()` for general default behaviors, using `EXPECT_CALL()` only for calls you need to verify.
- Use `NiceMock<>` for mocks where uninteresting calls should not cause warnings.
- For mocks where unexpected calls are errors, use `StrictMock<>` carefully.
- Avoid fragile order dependencies unless explicitly needed.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations that should become inactive once satisfied.

---

### 2.4 Strategies for Large Codebases

Scaling tests requires careful management:

- **Group Related Expectations:** Use `ExpectationSet` to bundle prerequisites for `.After()` clauses.
- **Delegate Default Behaviors Appropriately:** Use `ON_CALL()` to configure mock defaults in test fixtures or constructors.
- **Use Diagnostic Flags:** Utilize `--gmock_verbose` to debug uninteresting versus unexpected calls, reducing noisy warnings.
- **Manage Mock Lifespan:** Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if necessary to handle mock lifespan in complex async or death tests.
- **Clear and Verify Expectations:** Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to explicitly check mocks before reusing or destroying.

## 3. Step-by-Step Best Practices

<Steps>
<Step title="Define Clear Mock Interfaces">
Create mock classes with precise method signatures using `MOCK_METHOD` in the public section, even if mocking private or protected base methods. Use wrappers or typedefs to simplify complex argument types.

```cpp
// Example:
class MockLogger {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Log, (int severity, const std::string& message), (override));
};
```
</Step>

<Step title="Establish Default Behavior with ON_CALL">
Set up the default behavior of mock methods using `ON_CALL()` with `WillByDefault()` to handle calls your tests are not specifically verifying.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_logger, Log(_, _)).WillByDefault(Return());
```

This reduces noise from uninteresting calls and centralizes default responses.
</Step>

<Step title="Express Explicit Expectations with EXPECT_CALL">
Use `EXPECT_CALL()` only for calls whose invocation count or arguments you want to verify. Specify cardinality accurately using `.Times()`, relying on implicit inference when sensible.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_logger, Log(Warning, _)).Times(AtLeast(1));
```

Avoid overusing `EXPECT_CALL` since it adds test brittleness.
</Step>

<Step title="Control Call Order When Needed">
Use `Sequence` and `InSequence` to define expected call ordering only if your code depends on it.

```cpp
{
 InSequence seq;
 EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1());
 EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2());
}
```

Use `.After()` or multiple sequences to define partial orders in complex scenarios.
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Complex Argument Matching">
Leverage GoogleMock's rich matcher ecosystem to validate complex or composite argument conditions. Use `With()` clause to apply a multi-argument matcher for contextual validations.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_, _)).With(Lt()); // first arg less than second
```
</Step>

<Step title="Prevent Flakiness by Relaxing Expectations">
Suppress flaky failures by:

- Using `NiceMock<>` on mocks where uninteresting calls are expected but unverified.
- Applying `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to expectations which should deactivate after being satisfied.
- Adding fallback `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to catch unverified calls without failures.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Mock Verification to Detect Missed Expectations">
Explicitly verify and clear mock expectations using `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to enforce proper test order and avoid leftover unsatisfied expectations, especially in destructors or between test phases.

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock));
```
</Step>

<Step title="Leverage Diagnostic Verbosity">
Use `--gmock_verbose=info` or `warning` to tune how much diagnostic information GoogleMock emits, making debugging easier while keeping production test logs clean.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Setting up a Mock with Default and Expected Calls

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Query, (const std::string& query), ());
};

void SetupMock(MockDatabase& mock) {
  // Default behavior
  ON_CALL(mock, Connect(_)).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  ON_CALL(mock, Query(_)).WillByDefault(Return("default result"));

  // Expect specific calls
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Connect("db://localhost")).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Query("SELECT * FROM users")).WillOnce(Return("user1,user2"));
}
```

### Example: Sequencing Calls with Partial Order

```cpp
Sequence seq1, seq2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, StepA()).InSequence(seq1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, StepB()).InSequence(seq1, seq2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, StepC()).InSequence(seq2);
```

Here `StepA` must occur before `StepB`, and `StepB` before `StepC`. `StepA` and `StepC` do not have enforced ordering against each other.

## 5. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Uninteresting call warnings:** Use `NiceMock<>` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for noisy but expected calls.

- **Unexpected calls causing failures:** Check your matchers and argument expectations carefully; add catch-all expectations if necessary.

- **Overly strict order causing brittle tests:** Prefer partial ordering using multiple sequences or `After()` clauses.

- **Flaky test failures from unsatisfied expectations:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after use.

- **Mock leak detection failures:** Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional or investigate object lifecycle.

### Best Practices

- Use `ON_CALL` to set default mock behaviors and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for key verifications.
- Favor `NiceMock` during development to reduce noise, switch to `StrictMock` for final or critical tests.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag to adjust diagnostic output based on your troubleshooting stage.
- Split large test suites into smaller, focused test fixtures for maintainability.
