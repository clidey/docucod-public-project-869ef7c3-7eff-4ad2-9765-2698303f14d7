# Optimizing Test Performance in Large Codebases

## Overview
When working in large C++ codebases, test suite runtime can quickly become a bottleneck impacting developer feedback cycles and CI throughput. This guide focuses on practical techniques tailored to GoogleTest users aimed at reducing test execution time, efficiently managing inter-test dependencies, and leveraging parallelization to keep tests fast and maintainable as your codebase grows.

---

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

### Why Optimize Test Performance?
- **Fast feedback**: Developers get immediate validation of changes.
- **CI efficiency**: Minimizes resource use and wait times.
- **Scalability**: Ensures testing remains feasible as code grows.

### Common Causes of Slow Tests
- Large numbers of tests executing sequentially.
- Tests with heavy setup/teardown that could be shared.
- Tests with hidden dependencies causing serialization.
- Tests that consume excessive resources or block unnecessarily.

---

## 2. Key Techniques for Performance Improvement

### a. Parallelizing Test Execution
GoogleTest supports sharding and environments where tests can be split across multiple processors or hosts.

**How to Enable Parallel Test Sharding:**
1. Set `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` environment variable to the total number of shards (machines/processors).
2. Set `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to the zero-based index of the current shard.

Example: Running tests on 3 shards:

```bash
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3
# On first machine
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./my_test

# On second
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./my_test

# On third
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2
./my_test
```

Each shard will run a unique subset of the tests, speeding overall test execution proportionally.

<Check>
Parallel execution only works effectively if tests are independent and do not share state that causes conflicts.
</Check>

### b. Reusing Resources with Test Suite SetUp/TearDown
Use per-test-suite (formerly "per-test-case") setup and teardown to share expensive resources rather than recreating them per test.

GoogleTest calls `SetUpTestSuite()` before the **first** test in your fixture runs, and `TearDownTestSuite()` after the **last**.

```cpp
class MyTestSuite : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* MyTestSuite::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

This significantly reduces repeated initialization costs.

<Tip>
Avoid relying on cross-test order; tests must remain independent even when sharing static resources.
</Tip>

### c. Selective Test Execution and Filtering
Use GoogleTest's filtering flag `--gtest_filter` to run only a subset of tests relevant to the changes.

```bash
./my_test --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*  # Runs all tests in MyTestSuite
./my_test --gtest_filter=*Fast*         # Runs tests with 'Fast' in their name
./my_test --gtest_filter=-*Slow*        # Runs all tests except those with 'Slow'
```

Selective execution reduces runtime during iterative development.

### d. Avoid Excessive Assertions in Loops
Per the `googletest/test/gtest_stress_test.cc` example, running large numbers of assertions in concurrent threads can impact performance.

Balance the need for thorough checks with the cost of frequent failure detection.

### e. Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to Isolate Slow Debugging Failures
`SCOPED_TRACE` helps identify failing subroutine calls while avoiding redundant detailed diagnostics when parallelizing or retrying.

```cpp
SCOPED_TRACE("Loop iteration " << i);
EXPECT_EQ(ComputeValue(i), expected[i]);
```

---

## 3. Managing Test Dependencies

### Avoid Implicit Dependencies
Tests that depend on external state or previous tests slow parallelization and increase flakiness.

Always aim for tests that:
- Initialize their own state.
- Tear down all state they modify.
- Use mock objects or scoped resources to isolate changes.

### Using `GTEST_SKIP()` to Reduce Unnecessary Test Runs
`GTEST_SKIP()` allows skipping tests dynamically based on runtime conditions (e.g., environment variable settings, missing dependencies).

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, SkipIfNotSupported) {
  if (!IsFeatureAvailable()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "Skipping as feature is unavailable.";
  }
  ...
}
```

This reduces wasted time on irrelevant tests.

## 4. Practical Workflow to Optimize Large Test Suites

<Steps>
<Step title="Analyze Test Suite Runtime">
Use tools (profilers, test logs) to identify longest running and most frequently failing tests.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Sharding and Parallel Runs">
Configure your CI or local environment to run tests in shards or in parallel on multiple CPU cores using environment variables.
</Step>
<Step title="Refactor Shared Resource Initialization">
Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to move expensive setup out of individual tests.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Subsets During Development">
Leverage test filtering (`--gtest_filter`) to avoid running irrelevant tests on every build.
</Step>
<Step title="Audit Test Independence">
Check for implicit dependencies and side effects that block parallel execution or cause flakes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Performance Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running in Parallel">
Check that no two tests share mutable global/static state or files that cause serialization.
Verify usage of `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` and `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` env variables is correct.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Resource Contention in Parallel Tests">
When tests access shared resources (e.g. databases, files, sockets), limit concurrency or mock out such resources.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Long Setup/Teardown Times">
Verify that expensive initialization is moved to per-suite setup (`SetUpTestSuite`).
Profile constructors and teardown methods to find bottlenecks.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flaky Tests Due to Dependencies">
Add explicit setup/reset for any shared state.
Consider using `SCOPED_TRACE` to pinpoint failure contexts.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Keep tests isolated and side-effect free to maximize parallel scalability.
- Utilize GoogleTest environment variables for fine control over test execution.
- Use `RecordProperty()` (see [Assertions Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/assertions.html#RecordProperty)) to log metrics about test duration or resource usage.
- Regularly profile large test suites to detect regressions in runtime.
- Combine GoogleTest features (like parameterized tests) with sharding to maintain test coverage with minimal runtime.
- Document and mark expensive or slow tests as `DISABLED_` to exclude from default runs.

### Code Snippet: Minimal Parallel Shard Setup
```bash
# Bash example
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./my_test_binary &

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./my_test_binary &

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2
./my_test_binary &

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=3
./my_test_binary &

wait  # Wait for all shards
```

### Practical Example: Sharing Setup in Test Suite
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_connection_ = InitDatabaseConnection();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    CloseDatabaseConnection(db_connection_);
    db_connection_ = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    BeginTransaction(db_connection_);
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    RollbackTransaction(db_connection_);
  }

  static DatabaseConnection* db_connection_;
};

DatabaseConnection* DatabaseTest::db_connection_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryReturnsExpectedResult) {
  EXPECT_EQ(QueryUserCount(db_connection_), 0);
}
```

This configuration runs the costly connection setup once per suite, but resets state between tests.
