# Optimizing Test Performance and Scalability

## Overview

This guide explains proven techniques and best practices to write fast, maintainable, and scalable tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It focuses exclusively on minimizing overhead in test discovery and execution, avoiding typical sources of fragility, and leveraging advanced features designed to streamline large test suites.

By adopting these approaches, you achieve efficient validation cycles in your software development, enabling quick feedback and reducing the testing bottleneck common in sizable C++ codebases.

---

## 1. Preparing for Optimization

### Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with writing tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
- Your project set up with mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Tests that are currently stable and correctly exercising code behavior.

### Expected Outcome
Following this guide, your tests will:
- Run significantly faster by reducing unnecessary setup and overhead.
- Produce more reliable results by avoiding flaky behaviors.
- Scale well when the test suite grows in size and complexity.

### Time Estimate
Implementation time varies by project size; smaller projects may integrate many practices in under a day, larger codebases may spread changes over multiple sprints.

### Difficulty Level
Intermediate to advanced - requires understanding of test internals and mocking behavior.

---

## 2. Minimize Test Discovery and Setup Overhead

### Use Focused Test Filters
Limit which tests run using `--gtest_filter` to avoid executing costly or unrelated tests during development cycles.

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.MyTest
```

Use this actively while iterating to zoom in on a relevant subset.

### Avoid Excessive Test Fixture Setup
If your fixture setup (`SetUp()`, `TearDown()`) is heavy, consider:
- Moving heavy setup to once-per-test-suite fixtures or shared resources.
- Lazily initializing components only when needed.

### Isolate Slow Tests and Mark Accordingly
Annotate known slow tests with labels or disabled prefixes (e.g., `DISABLED_`) to avoid routine execution.

### Reuse Mock Objects Across Tests When Safe
Avoid re-constructing mocks repeatedly if the setup cost is significant.

---

## 3. Reduce Mocking Overhead

GoogleMock provides mechanisms to manage uninteresting calls and strictness to optimize test runtime and output clarity.

### Choose Appropriate Mock Strictness
GoogleMock supports three mock strictness levels:

- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings for any uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock** (default): Prints warnings for uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Using `NiceMock<T>` for mocks where you don't care about all calls reduces overhead from warnings and logging.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
```

### Implement Default Actions with ON_CALL
Instead of setting expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) for all mocked methods, use `ON_CALL` to set default behavior, letting mocks respond quickly without verbose checks when behavior is not under test.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_foo, DoSomething()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
```

### Retire Expectations to Avoid Sticky Calls
An expectation remains active even after its `Times()` limit is reached, consuming runtime and checking calls redundantly. Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to automatically retire expectations after their upper bound is reached:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Foo())
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
```

This disengages expectations as soon as possible, reducing overhead.

---

## 4. Avoid Flaky and Unreliable Tests

### Do Not Overconstrain Expectations
Avoid overly strict expectations and ordering unless necessary. Excessively brittle tests can cause flaky failures, which slow feedback.

### Use `InSequence` and `Sequence` Objects Judiciously
Sequence constraints ensure order but increase test fragility and runtime. Apply only when order matters explicitly.

Example of in-sequence expectation:

```cpp
{
  ::testing::InSequence seq;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall());
}
```

### Control Uninteresting Calls with Mock Types
Use `NiceMock` for components that do not require strict interaction verification. Use `StrictMock` sparingly.

### Isolate Tests That Involve Global State or External Dependencies
Tests that rely on mutable global state or external resources can be flaky or slow. Mock or stub these interactions or isolate these tests.

---

## 5. Leveraging Advanced Features

### Parameterized and Typed Tests
Use parameterized tests to reduce code duplication and improve execution by grouping similar test cases.

See [Parameterized and Type-based Tests](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/advanced.html#typed-tests) for implementation.

### Parallel Test Execution
Structure your tests so they can run concurrently, for example by:
- Using thread-safe fixtures or no shared mutable state.
- Avoid sharing resources without proper locking.

Use build systems or CI tools with test parallelization capabilities (e.g., Bazel, CTest).

### Test Sharding
Divide tests into shards to run subsets across multiple machines or processes. This reduces wall-clock time.

### Cache or Mock Expensive Setup
Use mocks or fakes to avoid doing heavy computations or network I/O during tests.

---

## 6. Debugging and Fine-Tuning Performance

### Enable Verbose Mock Logging Temporarily
Use the flag `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock call traces for diagnosing slow or unexpected test behavior.

```bash
./my_tests --gmock_verbose=info
```

### Detect Leaked Mocks
Leaked mocks can cause unexpected results and increased test runtime. Enable `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks=true` to catch them.

### Profiling Test Runs
Instrument test runs to find hotspots or slow tests using standard profilers or timing hooks.

### Mock Heap Checking
Use heap checkers integrated with GoogleTest to detect improper mock object lifetimes, which can degrade performance.

---

## 7. Practical Code Examples

### Using NiceMock to Reduce Noise

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::NiceMock;

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetRecordCount, (), (const));
};

TEST(DatabaseTest, TestUsingNiceMock) {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1);

  // Other calls to mock_db.GetRecordCount() produce no warnings.
  mock_db.Connect();
  mock_db.GetRecordCount();
}
```

### Retiring on Saturation

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(2).RetiresOnSaturation();

mock_db.Connect(); // First call
mock_db.Connect(); // Second call
mock_db.Connect(); // This will match other expectations or be uninteresting
```

---

## 8. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Pitfall: Excessive Logging from Uninteresting Calls
If you see lots of warnings about uninteresting mock function calls:
- Switch to `NiceMock<T>` to suppress them.
- Or add default actions with `ON_CALL()`.

### Pitfall: Failing Tests due to Sticky Expectations
Avoid unexpected call failures from previously saturated expectations without `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.

### Pitfall: Slower Test Starts due to Heavy Fixture Setup
Minimize per-test setup in test fixtures; consider `SetUpTestSuite()` or shared mocks.

### Pitfall: Tests Broken by Ordering Constraints
Only specify sequences or `InSequence` when call ordering is critical.

### Pitfall: Leaked Mocks
Enable `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks` and use `Mock::AllowLeak` to explicitly control mock object lifetimes.
