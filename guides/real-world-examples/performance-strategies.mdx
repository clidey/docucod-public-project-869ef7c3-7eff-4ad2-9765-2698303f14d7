# Performance and Scalability Strategies

Optimize your GoogleTest test suites for large codebases by learning how to write scalable tests, reduce runtime, and leverage GoogleTest’s advanced execution options. This guide equips you with actionable strategies to handle sizeable test sets efficiently, so your tests run faster, scale smoothly, and remain maintainable.

---

## Overview

### What You'll Achieve

This guide teaches you how to design and run GoogleTest suites that perform efficiently at scale. You'll understand how to minimize test runtime, distribute test execution, and reduce overhead in large projects.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with writing basic tests using GoogleTest.
- A working GoogleTest setup integrated with your build system.

### Expected Outcome

By following these strategies, your large test suites will run faster, use resources efficiently, and scale across machines or cores.

### Time Estimate

Depending on your current project size and complexity, expect to spend between 30 minutes to a few hours implementing these optimizations.

### Difficulty Level

Intermediate: Requires practical knowledge of GoogleTest features and build/test workflows.

---

## Key Strategies for Performance and Scalability

### 1. Parallel Test Execution

Running tests in parallel utilizes multiple CPU cores to speed up test runs.

- **Use `--gtest_parallel`**: GoogleTest can natively run tests in parallel if your environment supports it.
- **Leverage Bazel or CMake parallel builds**: Integrate GoogleTest with build systems supporting parallel test execution.

**Best practices:**
- Ensure tests are independent; avoid shared state that causes race conditions.
- Use thread-safe test fixtures and mocks.

---

### 2. Test Sharding

Distribute subsets of your test suite across machines or processes (shards) to run tests concurrently.

- Set environment variables:
  ```bash
  GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=<total_shards>
  GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=<shard_index>
  ```

- GoogleTest automatically runs only tests assigned to the current shard.

**Use case:**
- Useful in CI environments with multiple agents.
- Accelerates total test suite completion.

**Note:**
- Shards run mutually exclusive test sets.

---

### 3. Test Filtering and Selection

Run only a subset of tests to save time during development iterations.

- Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to specify test suites or test names to run, wildcard supported.

Example:
```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MySuite1.*:MySuite2.SomeTest
```

**Tips:**
- Combine filters to isolate failing tests.
- Use negative patterns to exclude slow tests.

---

### 4. Test Shuffling

Shuffling tests help detect dependencies and ensure reliability.

- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order.
- Reproduce failures by using the displayed random seed with `--gtest_random_seed`.

---

### 5. Minimizing Test Overhead

Large test suites can suffer from overhead caused by test setup and teardown.

- Use test fixtures wisely: share resources when safe by using `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`.
- Avoid expensive initialization in every test.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip known slow tests temporarily.

---

### 6. Efficient Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests can explode test counts but write them efficiently:

- Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` sparingly with carefully selected parameter sets.
- Consider filtering or sharding parameterized instances.

---

### 7. Optimize Mock Usage for Performance

Although mocking itself is mostly about test design, consider:

- Avoid overly complex mocks that slow down tests.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` selectively to reduce unnecessary warnings.
- Reuse mock instances if possible, avoiding repetitive construction.

## Step-by-Step: Implementing Parallel Execution and Sharding

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Parallel Test Execution">
    Add the `--gtest_parallel` flag when running your test binary:

    ```bash
    ./my_tests --gtest_parallel
    ```

    Verify that tests run across multiple CPU cores concurrently by monitoring CPU usage.

    <Check>
    Ensure all tests are thread-safe and do not rely on shared mutable state.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Test Sharding in Your Environment">
    1. Determine the total number of shards (e.g., number of machines or processes).

    2. Assign each test runner a shard index from `0` to `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS - 1`.

    3. Set environment variables before test execution:

       ```bash
       export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
       export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 # Change this per test runner
       ./my_tests
       ```

    4. Run tests simultaneously on all shards.

    5. Collect results from all runners.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter Tests for Development Iterations">
    Use selective filtering to run relevant tests only:

    ```bash
    ./my_tests --gtest_filter=MySuite.Fast*:-*SlowTests
    ```

    This runs tests starting with "Fast" but excludes tests with "SlowTests" in their name.

    <Tip>
    Use filtering combined with sharding to distribute focused test subsets across shards.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

- **Isolate Tests**: Design tests to be independent to enable parallelization and sharding without risks.
- **Use Test Suites to Group Related Tests**: Organize tests into suites allowing selective execution.
- **Leverage Test Fixtures for Shared Setup**: Avoid per-test expensive operations by using shared fixture setup.
- **Avoid Global State or Singleton Dependencies**: This reduces flakiness and improves parallel test reliability.
- **Use Filtering Wisely**: Narrow down the running tests early in development to save time.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Race Conditions in Parallel Runs**: Shared state without synchronization causes flaky tests.
- **Overly Broad Shards**: Assign shards that are too large or too small causing skew and underutilized resources.
- **Ignoring Test Overhead**: Initialization costs lead to significantly longer test durations.
- **Missing `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` or `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` Environment Variables**: Tests will not shard correctly.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

### Troubleshooting

- Tests fail or behave unexpectedly in parallel runs:
  - Check for shared mutable state.
  - Use thread sanitizers to detect race conditions.

- Sharding results in tests not running or some tests running multiple times:
  - Verify environment variables and their values.
  - Confirm build artifacts are the same across shards.

- Test filtering doesn’t apply as expected:
  - Confirm test names do not contain underscores (`_`).
  - Use `--gtest_list_tests` to verify test names.

### Tips

- Periodically shuffle tests during integration to catch hidden dependencies.
- For large parameterized tests, consider selective instantiation or splitting.
- Use the GoogleTest verbosity flags (`--gtest_verbose`) to debug test execution order and matching.
