# Performance and Scaling Test Suites

## Overview

As your GoogleTest codebase grows, maintaining fast and reliable test execution becomes crucial. This guide helps you optimize test suite performance and scale testing effectively by sharing practical techniques to reduce runtime, enable parallel test execution, and design large test suites for maintainability and speed.

By applying these strategies, you will achieve faster feedback cycles and more efficient use of computing resources, which is vital in large projects or continuous integration environments.

## 1. Reducing Test Runtime

### Why Test Performance Matters

Slow tests disrupt developer productivity, increase build pipeline times, and can cause flaky test behaviors in resource-constrained environments. Optimizing tests ensures tests run quickly and consistently, encouraging frequent execution.

### Key Techniques to Minimize Runtime

#### a. Minimize Expensive Setup and Teardown

- Use test fixtures effectively to share expensive resources across tests in a suite via `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`. This avoids duplicating costly initialization for each test.
- Prefer lightweight initializations in `SetUp()` that only prepare fresh state and reserve heavy-lifting only to the test suite level.

#### b. Avoid Unnecessary Data Copies

- Use references or pointers within tests instead of making expensive deep copies.
- For fixtures, store shared objects using smart pointers to control lifetimes without redundant copies.

#### c. Write Targeted Tests

- Isolate unit tests by mocking or faking dependencies to avoid slow external interactions.
- Avoid unnecessary complex operations or large data inputs when smaller, representative data suffice.

#### d. Use Efficient Assertions

- Prefer lightweight assertions (`EXPECT_`) over fatal ones (`ASSERT_`) when possible, to allow test continuation and better fault isolation.

#### e. Parallelize Slow Test Segments

- Decompose heavy tests into smaller units that can be run concurrently.

### Measuring Test Performance

- Use test timers and GoogleTest’s output to identify the slowest tests.
- Profile tests under the full suite to discover bottlenecks.


## 2. Running Tests in Parallel

Parallel execution drastically improves wall-clock testing times by leveraging multi-core systems or distributed environments.

### Enable Test Parallelism

- **Test Sharding:** Use the built-in GoogleTest sharding to split tests based on `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` environment variables.

  ```shell
  export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
  export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 # Run on first shard
  ./my_test
  # Repeat with GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1..3 on other nodes
  ```

- **Test Shuffling:** Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test execution order, uncovering ordering dependencies.

- **Parallel Test Runners:** Run multiple instances of the test executable concurrently with filtered test sets (e.g., `--gtest_filter`), or use external tools like `gtest-parallel` to automate.

### Considerations

- Ensure tests are isolated without global shared state that can cause race conditions.
- Use fixtures for shared resources carefully; prefer read-only or thread-safe resources.
- Test output management must handle merged logs from parallel runs.

### Example: Running a Subset of Tests on Each Machine

```shell
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0
./foo_test

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1
./foo_test

export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2
./foo_test
```

Each instance runs a unique subset of tests without overlap.

## 3. Structuring Large Test Suites

A large number of tests can cause slow startup, memory bloat, and debugging difficulties.

### Best Practices for Organizing Tests

#### a. Logical Grouping

- Divide related tests into test suites reflecting code structure or features.
- Use meaningful and consistent test suite and test names to ease filtering and identification.

#### b. Sharing Expensive Resources

- Employ `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` static methods for common expensive fixtures.
- Avoid global variables; prefer scoped static members within fixtures.

#### c. Parameterized and Typed Tests

- Use value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) and typed tests (`TYPED_TEST`) to reduce test code duplication.
- This reduces binary size and compilation time.

#### d. Use Disabled Tests for Temporarily Broken or Long-Running Tests

- Prefix test or test suite names with `DISABLED_` to exclude them from runs but keep code compiled.
- Reactivate only when ready.

#### e. Avoid Fragile Tests

- Write tests with minimal dependencies on execution order.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` often during development to catch unintended test dependencies.

## 4. Tooling and Flags for Performance

### Useful GoogleTest Flags

- `--gtest_repeat=N` to repeat tests N times (helps identify flaky tests).
- `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop on first failure saves time during development.
- `--gtest_filter` to run targeted subsets quickly.
- `--gtest_output=xml:<file>` to collect results for later analysis.

### Environment Variables

- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` for splitting tests across machines.
- `GTEST_COLOR=yes/no/auto` for colored output (improves readability).

## 5. Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Test Dependencies:** Avoid tests sharing mutable global or static state.
- **Side Effects:** Tests should clean up after themselves.
- **Flaky Tests:** Use repeated runs (`--gtest_repeat`) and isolates to identify flakiness.
- **Long-running Tests:** Mark long tests as such and consider running them in separate shards or schedules.
- **Thread Safety:** Make tests thread-safe if you plan to run them in parallel.


## 6. Example Workflow: Parallelizing a Large Test Suite with Shared Resources

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify slow tests and expensive setup">
  Use timing tools or GoogleTest's output to identify slow-running tests or expensive setup procedures.
</Step>
<Step title="Refactor resource setup to SetUpTestSuite()">
  Modify test fixtures to allocate shared resources once per test suite using static `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable test sharding">
  Configure environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to split test execution across build agents or cores.
</Step>
<Step title="Run tests with parallel test runner or script">
  Use tools like `gtest-parallel` or custom scripts that launch multiple test instances, using `--gtest_filter` to control which tests each instance runs.
</Step>
<Step title="Review and optimize flaky or order-dependent tests">
  If failures occur intermittently, investigate test dependencies and state sharing using `--gtest_shuffle`.
</Step>
</Steps>
