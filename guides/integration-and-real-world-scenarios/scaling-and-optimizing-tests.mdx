# Scaling and Optimizing Test Execution

Efficiently running large test suites is critical to maintaining rapid development cycles and ensuring timely feedback in Continuous Integration (CI) environments. This guide presents practical strategies to scale and optimize your GoogleTest and GoogleMock test executions.

---

## Why Optimize Test Execution?

As your test suite grows, the time required to run all tests can increase significantly, slowing down development and integration. Optimizing test execution helps you:

- Reduce overall test runtime
- Accelerate CI feedback loops
- Improve resource utilization
- Maintain test stability and reliability

This page focuses **specifically** on strategies for scaling and optimizing how tests run, including leveraging parallelism, test selection, and recommended practices.

---

## Prerequisites

Before applying these techniques, ensure:

- Your project is using [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) with the GoogleMock extension for mocking needs.
- You can build and run tests reliably in your environment.
- Basic familiarity with writing and running tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

---

## Expected Outcome

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Run large suites of tests more efficiently.
- Use parallel testing tools to utilize multiple CPU cores.
- Select and run relevant subsets of tests to focus on changed code.
- Adopt practices that prevent slow tests from degrading feedback speed.

---

## Time Estimate

Setting up parallel builds and test selection can take from a few hours to a couple of days depending on your environment complexity.

---

## Difficulty Level

Intermediate to Advanced, especially if integrating with custom CI workflows.

# Strategies for Scaling and Optimizing Test Execution

### 1. Leveraging Parallel Test Execution

GoogleTest itself runs tests sequentially by default. To fully utilize modern multi-core machines and speed up test runs, run tests in parallel using external tools:

- **Parallel Test Runners:** Use tools or build system features that run tests concurrently, such as `bazel test --jobs=N`, CTest with parallel options, or GNU Make parallel execution.

- **Splitting Test Suites:** Partition large test binaries into smaller, more focused test executables. This enables parallel runs with fine-grained resource assignment.

- **Test Sharding:** Some CI infrastructures support test sharding, where tests are split into chunks executed simultaneously on different machines or containers.

#### Best Practices with Parallelism

- Ensure tests are isolated and do not share mutable global state to prevent flaky results.
- Avoid dependencies on external shared resources unless properly mocked or serialized.
- Use GoogleMock and GoogleTest's thread-safe features carefully when mocking in multi-threaded test scenarios (see [docs on concurrency](docs/primer.md#known-limitations)).

---

### 2. Test Selection Techniques

Not all tests need to be run all the time. Select tests intelligently:

- **Change-Based Test Selection:** Run only tests related to recently modified code. Integrate your testing with source control metadata.

- **Tagging Tests:** Use labels or custom attributes to categorize tests, so you can run subsets quickly (e.g., `--gtest_filter` on GoogleTest).

- **Fail-Fast Configuration:** Configure tests or test runners to stop after first failure to reduce turnaround time when debugging.

Example: Run specific tests using GoogleTest filter flags:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.Name1:MyTestSuite.Name2
```

---

### 3. Use Efficient Test Fixtures and Mocks

Writing fast tests often comes down to better mock usage and test design.

- Use **GoogleMock** to replace expensive dependencies (databases, networks).
- Leverage **ON_CALL()** for defining default behaviors without strict expectations to reduce test brittleness.
- Prefer **NiceMock** to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls and keep test logs clean.
- Use **StrictMock** for tests where unexpected calls should fail to catch regressions early.

For advanced mocking strategies and examples, see:

- [Creating and Using Mocks](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/mocking-and-advanced-techniques/creating-and-using-mocks.md)
- [gMock Cookbook](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_cook_book.md)

---

### 4. Continuous Integration (CI) Feedback Best Practices

- Run **critical and fast tests first** to get early feedback.
- Run **longer, more comprehensive tests in nightly builds** to avoid blocking developers.
- Use **test result caching** and parallelism in CI pipelines.
- Monitor **test flakiness** and isolate flaky tests to stabilize overall runs.

# Related Open Source Test Runners

GoogleTest can be integrated with several external test runners and tools to enhance parallel execution:

| Runner Name  | Description                          | Notes                                                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [GoogleTestX](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) | A script supporting parallel execution of GoogleTest binaries. | Simple to use, good for multi-core machines.                  |
| [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html) | The CMake test driver supporting parallel test running. | Well integrated if using CMake-based projects.                |
| Bazel Test Runner | Provides advanced parallel testing and sharding support. | Ideal for large-scale monorepos and cloud CI environments. |

Integrate these tools into your workflow to fully leverage your build and test infrastructure.

# Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Tests Run Slowly Despite Parallel Execution">
- **Cause:** Test binaries contain many slow individual tests or heavyweight setup.
- **Solution:** Split test binaries into smaller units; optimize the slowest tests individually; use mocks to replace expensive dependencies.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flaky Tests in Parallel Runs">
- **Cause:** Shared state, non-thread-safe mocks, or race conditions.
- **Solution:** Identify and isolate shared resources; use thread-safe test patterns; run flaky tests sequentially or in isolated environments.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Excessive Output and Noise in Logs">
- **Cause:** Uninteresting or unexpected calls producing warnings.
- **Solution:** Use `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for expected calls; tune verbosity using the `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning`, `error`).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
For considerably faster test feedback, prioritize writing fine-grained, isolated tests that run quickly and can be parallelized widely.
</Tip>

<Note>
GoogleMock and GoogleTest support multi-threaded tests but require care to avoid synchronization issues. Read [GoogleTest Primer](docs/primer.md) on known limitations regarding thread-safety.

# Summary

Scaling your GoogleTest and GoogleMock test execution allows you to run large suites efficiently, improving developer productivity and CI throughput. By running tests in parallel, selecting focused test subsets, using mocks effectively, and integrating with external runners, you can achieve rapid feedback without sacrificing test quality.

# Example: Parallel Test Execution with gtest-parallel

```bash
# Run all GoogleTest binaries in parallel using all available CPU cores.
gtest-parallel ./path/to/test_binary1 ./path/to/test_binary2
```

This command splits test cases from multiple binaries across cores for faster execution.

# Example: Running Specific Tests with Filtering

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.TestCaseA:MyTestSuite.TestCaseB
```

Filters and runs only `TestCaseA` and `TestCaseB` from `MyTestSuite`.

# Example: Using --gmock_verbose to Control Log Verbosity

```bash
./my_test_binary --gmock_verbose=warning
```

Outputs warnings and errors about mock calls but suppresses info-level details.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does GoogleTest support parallel test runs internally?**

A: GoogleTest executes tests sequentially within a binary. Parallelism is achieved by running multiple test binaries in parallel with external tools.

**Q: How do I speed up tests that rely on slow external resources?**

A: Use GoogleMock to substitute slow or unreliable dependencies with mocks that run quickly and deterministically.

**Q: What if some tests are flaky when running in parallel?**

A: Isolate side effects and shared state in tests or mark flaky tests to run serially while fixing their thread-safety.
