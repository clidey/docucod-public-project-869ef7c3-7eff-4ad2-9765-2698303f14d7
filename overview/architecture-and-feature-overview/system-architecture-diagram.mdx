# System Architecture Diagram

Discover the high-level system architecture of GoogleTest and GoogleMock presented through a clear, structured Mermaid diagram. This visual overview helps new users and seasoned developers alike grasp how core modules like test definitions, assertion mechanisms, mocks, and the test runner interconnect to form a cohesive testing ecosystem.

---

## High-Level Architecture Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are tightly integrated frameworks that provide a robust infrastructure for defining, running, and verifying tests in C++. This diagram outlines their primary components and their relationships:

- **Test Definitions:** These include test cases and fixtures authored by users.
- **Assertions and Matchers:** Mechanisms to validate test outcomes and specify matching logic on values.
- **Mocks and Expectations:** Facilities provided by GoogleMock to simulate interfaces and verify interactions.
- **Test Runner:** The execution engine responsible for orchestrating test runs and reporting results.

The modular breakdown enables flexible extension points and clear separation of concerns, making GoogleTest and GoogleMock powerful and extensible.

## Module Descriptions and User Flow

### Test Definitions
This is where developers write unit tests and test fixtures. These definitions are processed by the framework to setup the test environment.

### Assertions and Matchers
Assertions verify conditions within tests, immediately flagging failures. Matchers enable detailed validation of argument values, supporting both simple and complex conditions.

### Mocks and Expectations
GoogleMock empowers developers to create mocked interfaces, set expectations on method calls, and control mocked behavior. It integrates seamlessly with assertions to validate interaction correctness.

### Test Runner
Coordinates test initialization, executes tests, manages test lifecycles, and ensures cleanup. It aggregates assertion results and integrates with reporting.

### Test Event Reporting
Handles all outputs related to test successes, failures, and statuses. This includes console output and XML report generation.

### User Code Under Test
The target code that tests drive, interact with mocks, and validate.

## Why This Matters

Understanding this architectural layout equips you to leverage GoogleTest and GoogleMock more effectively by appreciating:

- Where to plug in mocking and expectations
- How assertions and matchers fit into validation
- How test execution and reporting are orchestrated

This system's modularity ensures extensibility and adaptation for various advanced testing scenarios.

## Getting Started

To dive deeper and start writing your tests:

- Define tests and fixtures in your source files.
- Use GoogleMock macros to create mock classes and specify expectations.
- Write assertions using GoogleTest's expressive syntax.
- Run tests via the test runner.

For full guidance, visit the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and the [gMock Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md).
