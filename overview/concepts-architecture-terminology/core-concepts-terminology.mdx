# Core Concepts and Terminology

GoogleTest introduces a set of fundamental concepts and terms that are essential to understanding how to write, organize, and interpret tests effectively. This page walks you through these critical terms — assertions, test cases, test suites, fixtures, mocks, matchers, and parameterized tests — connecting each to practical user actions and everyday testing workflows.

## Understanding the Building Blocks of GoogleTest

### Assertions
Assertions are the basic checks you write that confirm whether your code behaves as expected. Each assertion verifies a condition and can result in either success, a nonfatal failure, or a fatal failure: 

- **Success** means the condition holds true.
- **Nonfatal failure** lets the test continue but marks it as failed.
- **Fatal failure** aborts the current test immediately.

GoogleTest provides a rich variety of assertion macros such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, or `EXPECT_THAT` (with matchers), allowing you to verify values, check conditions, or validate complex expressions. For instance:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Result does not match expected value.";
EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(input)) << "Input should be valid.";
```

Understanding assertion outcomes is key to diagnosing test results and error messages meaningfully.

### Test Cases and Test Suites
Originally known as *test cases*, groups of related tests are now called *test suites* in GoogleTest, emphasizing modern terminology alignment.

- A **test suite** is a collection of tests that logically belong together, often representing a class or module.
- Each **test** within a suite exercises a particular behavior or code path.

Example:

```cpp
// Test suite named MathTest
TEST(MathTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(MathTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Both tests belong to the `MathTest` suite, enabling organized reporting and setup/teardown sharing.

### Test Fixtures
When multiple tests require the same setup or shared resources, test fixtures provide a reusable foundation:

- A **test fixture** is a class derived from `testing::Test` that defines setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) logic, plus shared member variables.
- Tests using a fixture are declared with `TEST_F`, gaining access to fixture members.

Example:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  Queue<int> queue_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(queue_.size(), 1);
}
```

Fixtures help reduce duplicate code and foster consistent test environments.

### Mocks and Mock Objects
Mocks allow you to simulate and verify interactions with dependencies that your code under test interacts with but does not own:

- A **mock object** implements an interface like a real object but allows you to specify expected calls, call counts, argument matching, return behaviors, and call order.
- GoogleMock (gMock) is the related library for creating and working with mocks in GoogleTest.

Typical workflow with mocks:

1. Define or generate a mock class using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
2. Create mock instances in tests.
3. Specify expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) describing expected method calls.
4. Exercise the code under test.
5. GoogleMock verifies interactions automatically.

Example:

```cpp
class MockDatabase : public Database {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Disconnect, (), (override));
};

TEST(DatabaseClientTest, ConnectsAndDisconnects) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Disconnect()).Times(1);

  DatabaseClient client(&mock_db);
  client.Connect();
  client.Disconnect();
}
```

Mocks empower testing in isolation, improving speed, reliability, and clarity.

### Matchers
Matchers define how function arguments are verified in expectations and assertions:

- A **matcher** is a predicate describing expected properties of a method argument.
- Basic matchers include exact values (`Eq(value)`), wildcards (`_`), and range comparisons (`Ge(5)`, `Lt(10)`).
- You can compose matchers for complex argument matching.

Example usage:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(10), _));  // First argument >= 10, second is anything
EXPECT_THAT(value, HasSubstr("needle"));  // value contains substring "needle"
```

Matchers provide flexibility and expressiveness in checking method parameters.

### Parameterized Tests
You can run the same test logic over multiple input values without duplicating code:

- Parameterized tests are defined using `TEST_P` or `TYPED_TEST` (typed), with test classes inheriting from `TestWithParam<T>`.
- The test logic accesses the current parameter via `GetParam()`.
- Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to provide the set of parameters.

Example:

```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, CheckEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

This helps achieve thorough coverage with concise test code.

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding these core concepts unlocks the power of GoogleTest. It enables you to:

- Interpret test suites and failures accurately.
- Write test code that is maintainable, scalable, and expressive.
- Use test fixtures and mocks effectively to manage dependencies and improve test quality.
- Harness parameterized tests to explore wide input spaces with less effort.

This vocabulary is foundational for exploring GoogleTest’s advanced guides, API references, and integration topics.

## Practical Tips

- Start by writing simple `TEST()` cases, then add fixtures (`TEST_F`) where setup sharing is needed.
- Use assertions to check expected behavior; default to nonfatal (`EXPECT_`) for thorough testing, except when continuing is unsafe.
- Employ mocks to replace complex dependencies, controlling behavior and verifying interactions via expectations.
- Use matchers for flexible argument specification, avoiding brittle exact matches.
- Harness parameterized tests to efficiently apply a test across diverse inputs.

By grounding your test suite in these core concepts, you'll build robust, maintainable, and insightful testing code.
