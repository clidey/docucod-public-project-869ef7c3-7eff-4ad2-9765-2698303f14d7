# Supported Platforms & Integrations

GoogleTest supports a diverse and extensive range of compilers and platforms, adhering closely to Google's foundational C++ support policy. This ensures you can confidently use GoogleTest in practically any development environment where modern C++ is supported.

---

## Why This Matters

Successful automated testing hinges on your tools seamlessly fitting into your workflow, regardless of your platform or build environment. GoogleTest achieves this by offering broad compatibility and smooth integration with popular build systems and compilers, empowering you to focus on writing quality tests rather than wrestling with setup.

Whether you're working on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, or embedded platforms, GoogleTest aligns with your development ecosystem to provide reliable test execution.

---

## Platforms Supported

GoogleTest embraces the following operating systems and platforms, backed by rigorous support and ongoing maintenance:

- **Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants)**
- **Linux (including Android)**
- **Mac OS and iOS**
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD**
- **Solaris, AIX, HP-UX**
- **Fuchsia** (not officially supported, but buildable)
- **Embedded & Specialized Platforms** such as ESP8266, ESP32, QNX, and others

This extensive support is realized through platform-indicating macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX_ANDROID`) that GoogleTest uses internally to adapt functionality and ensure compatibility.

### C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports at least the **C++17 standard**. This ensures you can leverage modern C++ features while writing your tests. You should verify that your compiler and build system are configured accordingly (for example, by setting `-std=c++17` or equivalent).

---

## Compiler and Build System Integration

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with popular build systems and compilers, allowing you to build and use the framework as part of your project effortlessly.

### CMake

GoogleTest ships with a comprehensive CMake build script ([CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)) that supports a wide array of platforms.

- You can build GoogleTest as a standalone project or integrate it as a subdirectory in your project.
- The CMake `FetchContent` module allows you to automatically download and build GoogleTest during your project's configuration phase.
- CMake handles compiler and linker flags such as pthread inclusion automatically where needed.

#### Example: Adding GoogleTest as FetchContent
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/5376968f6948923e2411081fd9372e71a59d8e77.zip
)
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE) # For Windows dynamic CRT compatibility
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests my_tests.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

> This approach requires CMake 3.14 or later.

### Bazel

GoogleTest also supports building with **Bazel**. The repository includes a `BUILD.bazel` file that defines all targets and configurations needed for Bazel-based builds.

- Extensive platform configuration settings detect target OS automatically.
- Dependencies on Abseil libraries and RE2 may be automatically included if Abseil support is enabled.
- You can use Bazel to build both standalone GoogleTest binaries and libraries to include in your projects.

### Other Build Systems

While official support centers around CMake and Bazel, GoogleTest can be manually incorporated into other build setups by appropriately referencing source files and headers.

---

## Thread Safety and Platform Features

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms where the pthread library is available and recognized (Linux, Mac OS, etc.). You can verify this in your environment via the `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro after including GoogleTest headers.
- Support for death tests, stream redirection, and other advanced features is enabled selectively based on platform capabilities.

### Helpful Macros to Know

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` — Indicates if pthread support is available.
- `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` — Whether death tests are supported.
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` — Indicates if C++ exceptions are enabled.
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` — Runtime Type Information support status.

These macros help you understand the environment in which your tests run and adjust behavior if necessary.

---

## Dependency Management & Future Dependencies

GoogleTest optionally integrates with the **Abseil** library to leverage features such as the RE2 regex engine and improved flag handling. This support is controlled by build-system flags:

- When enabled (`GTEST_HAS_ABSL=1`), dependencies on Abseil containers, debugging utilities, flags, and RE2 are brought in.
- This optional integration reinforces GoogleTest's extensibility and aligns it with modern C++ infrastructure.

---

## Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- Always ensure your compiler supports C++17 or higher.
- On Windows with Visual Studio, consider the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option to avoid runtime library mismatches.
- Use CMake's `FetchContent` or git submodules for dependency management to keep GoogleTest up to date in your project.
- When integrating with build systems other than CMake or Bazel, double-check inclusion paths and link order.

---

## Real-World Integration Scenario

Imagine you're developing a cross-platform C++ desktop application that must support Windows and Linux. By using GoogleTest:
- You download the repository and integrate it via CMake's `FetchContent`.
- Your CI system builds GoogleTest alongside your app code on both Windows and Linux agents without modification.
- Tests run reliably, with thread safety guarantees and consistent behavior.

This smooth integration eliminates platform-specific testing headaches, giving you confidence to ship robust software faster.
