# Who Should Use These Frameworks?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are tailored for C++ developers and teams who seek automated, reliable unit testing that scales from small projects to large, complex applications. Whether you're working individually or as part of a development team, these frameworks empower you with robust tools to validate your code's correctness, behavior, and interactions in a maintainable and extensible way.

## Target Audiences

- **C++ Developers:** Individuals needing efficient solutions for test automation, validation, and mocking in their C++ projects.
- **Development Teams:** Groups aiming to establish consistent testing standards and practices, enabling collaborative test creation and maintenance.
- **Teams Seeking Automation:** Projects that demand automated verification of code behavior to catch regressions early, improve quality, and shorten development cycles.
- **Projects Requiring Platform Portability:** Those working across multiple platforms, where a testing framework must support diverse environments seamlessly.
- **Users Needing Extensible Mocking:** Developers who want fine-grained control over mocking behaviors and expectations with complex or evolving interfaces.

## Ideal Use Cases

GoogleTest and GoogleMock excel in a range of scenarios, including but not limited to:

- **Small to Medium Codebases:** Rapidly create and maintain unit tests that guarantee code correctness without excessive setup overhead.
- **Complex, Multi-Platform Applications:** Manage sophisticated testing needs where interfaces must be mocked across different operating systems or compilers.
- **Legacy Code Bases with Tight Coupling:** Enable incremental testing and refactoring by mocking dependencies that are challenging to isolate.
- **Highly Interactive Systems:** Test systems with extensive inter-object communications by specifying precise interaction expectations and verification.
- **Extensible Frameworks and Libraries:** Projects with interfaces that evolve or require user-extendable mocking or behavior specification.

The combination of GoogleTest for assertions and test execution, with GoogleMock for behavior specification and dependency isolation, forms a powerful toolkit to tackle these use cases efficiently.

## Why You Should Choose GoogleTest and GoogleMock

- **Declarative Mocking in C++:** Define mocks easily without boilerplate code.
- **Rich Matchers and Actions:** Validate function input and output with expressive matchers.
- **Flexible Expectations:** Specify call order, cardinality, and conditional matching.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Use the same test code on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems.
- **Automatic Verification:** Tests verify that all expectations are met without manual steps.
- **Extensibility:** Customize behaviors, matchers, and actions for your project’s unique needs.

These frameworks provide unmatched productivity and test reliability benefits for C++ projects of all sizes.

## Getting Started with These Frameworks

To embark on your testing journey:

1. Review the basic setup and installation instructions in the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms](../getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) and [Installing with CMake](../getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake) or [Installing with Bazel](../getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/installation-bazel) pages.

2. Learn how to write and run your first test in [Writing and Running Your First Test](../getting-started/configuration-first-run-validation/first-test).

3. Explore mocking concepts with detailed examples in [Mocking for Dummies](../googletest-guides/core-workflows/mocking-basics).

4. Dive deeper into sophisticated mocking scenarios in the [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md) and reference materials such as [gMock Cheat Sheet](../docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md) and [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md).

5. Consult the [Legacy gMock FAQ](../docs/gmock_faq.md) for common pitfalls and advanced tips.


<Tip>
