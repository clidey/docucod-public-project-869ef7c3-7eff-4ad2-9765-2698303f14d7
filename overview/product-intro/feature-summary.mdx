# Quick Feature Overview

GoogleTest is a powerful and flexible C++ testing framework designed to simplify and accelerate your testing process. This page provides a concise summary of GoogleTest’s most important features, helping you quickly grasp how it fits into your testing workflow.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers all the tests in your compiled test binary without additional registration. This feature saves you time and ensures that every defined test is executed without manual intervention.

- Tests are registered via macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()`.
- No need to manually list or enumerate tests.


## Rich Set of Assertions

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive collection of assertion macros and utilities that verify your code's correctness with meaningful failure messages.

- Over 30 distinct assertion macros like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_THROW`, and more.
- Support for predicate assertions that produce clear diagnostic messages.
- Seamlessly integrates with gMock matcher expressions via `EXPECT_THAT`.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);  // Verifies function returns expected result
}
```

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest provides advanced testing patterns that run the same test logic with different input parameters or types, reducing boilerplate and increasing coverage.

- *Value-Parameterized Tests*: Use `TEST_P()` with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` to test multiple parameter values.
- *Typed Tests*: Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` and `TYPED_TEST()` to repeat tests across different types.
- *Type-Parameterized Tests*: Define tests separately and instantiate types later for flexible reuse.

This enables data-driven and type-generic testing scenarios easily.

## Death Tests

Test that your code correctly terminates or exits under fatal error conditions with death tests.

- Use macros like `ASSERT_DEATH()` and `EXPECT_EXIT()` to verify program behavior during failure states.
- Supports matching exit codes and error output.
- Helps validate your program’s robustness and defensive checks.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, DiesOnInvalidInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(Foo(-1), "Invalid input");
}
```

## Controlling Test Order and Execution

GoogleTest offers extensive flags and environment variables to control how your test suite runs.

- **Filtering**: Run subsets of tests using `--gtest_filter` or environment variables.
- **Shuffling**: Randomize test order to detect dependencies with `--gtest_shuffle`.
- **Repeating**: Repeat tests to catch flaky behavior with `--gtest_repeat`.
- **Fail Fast**: Stop on first failure using `--gtest_fail_fast`.
- **Disabling**: Temporarily disable tests with the `DISABLED_` prefix.

## Seamless Integration and Extensibility

GoogleTest integrates well with build systems and continuous integration pipelines.

- Supports XML and JSON output formats for test results.
- Offers an event listener API to customize test output.
- Easily extend value printing by defining custom `AbslStringify()` or `PrintTo()`.
- Supports global and per-test setup/teardown mechanisms to share resources efficiently.

## Practical Scenarios

Here are some real-world ways GoogleTest’s key features can help you:

- **Automate Test Suites**: Automatically detect and run thousands of tests with minimal setup.
- **Write Robust Tests**: Use expressive assertions that explain failures clearly.
- **Test Multiple Inputs**: Ensure your functions behave correctly across ranges of values and types.
- **Validate Failure Handling**: Confirm your program safely aborts or handles error conditions.
- **Optimize Test Runs**: Run only what you need when debugging, or discover flaky tests.

## Common Pitfalls and Tips

- Use value and typed parameterization thoughtfully to reduce duplication, but avoid over-complicating tests.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` in gMock (GoogleMock) carefully to minimize brittle test failures.
- Always check failure messages for context—GoogleTest’s rich diagnostics help locate and understand issues.
- Consider integrating GoogleTest output with CI to gain visibility on build health and test coverage.
