# Integration with Other Systems

GoogleTest offers powerful ways to integrate seamlessly with various build systems, continuous integration pipelines, and popular IDE/test runner extensions. This integration capability accelerates the adoption of GoogleTest into your existing projects, ensuring that testing is an integral and frictionless part of your development workflow.

---

## Integrating with Build Systems

Effortless incorporation into your build system is critical for any testing framework. GoogleTest supports integration with widely used build systems such as CMake and Bazel, among others. Here’s how you can embed GoogleTest into your build process.

### Using GoogleTest with CMake

CMake users can leverage GoogleTest’s built-in support to automatically download, build, and link GoogleTest test binaries within their projects.

- **Configuring CMake:** Add GoogleTest as an external project or use the bundled CMake scripts.
- **Example Snippet:**

  ```cmake
  # Add GoogleTest as a subdirectory
  add_subdirectory(googletest)

  # Create your test executable
  add_executable(my_tests test_file.cc)

  # Link to GoogleTest libraries
  target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest gtest_main)

  # Enable testing
  enable_testing()
  add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
  ```

- This setup ensures that your tests are built and registered automatically.

### Using GoogleTest with Bazel

Bazel integration is natively supported through rules provided in the GoogleTest repository.

- **Simple Setup:** Use the `cc_test` rule, which supports GoogleTest out of the box.
- **Example BUILD file:**

  ```python
  cc_test(
      name = "my_test",
      srcs = ["my_test.cc"],
      deps = ["//third_party/googletest:gtest_main"],
  )
  ```

- Bazel handles fetching, building, and running tests efficiently, suited for projects invested in Bazel.

### Other Build Systems

For other build tools, such as Make, Ninja, or custom setups, GoogleTest distributes pkg-config files and example build configurations to assist your manual integration. Please refer to the [Platform & Toolchain Support](/overview/integration-and-ecosystem/platform-support) for more details.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Integration

Automating test execution as part of your CI builds is paramount. GoogleTest is designed to fit naturally into CI environments with features enabling easy test discovery and detailed test reporting.

- **Test Discovery:** Simply running the test binary executes all registered tests automatically.
- **Filtering Tests:** Use `--gtest_filter` command line flag to select specific tests or patterns.
- **Disabling Flaky Tests:** Mark tests as disabled via the `DISABLED_` prefix and selectively run them with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.
- **Output Formats:** GoogleTest supports XML and JSON test report outputs via `--gtest_output=xml:<file>` or `--gtest_output=json:<file>`, compatible with many CI tools.

Integrate these options in your CI job definitions to monitor test health and integrate with dashboards.

---

## IDEs and Test Runner Extensions

GoogleTest is widely supported by IDEs and test runners, streamlining test execution and debugging.

- **Popular IDE Support:**
  - JetBrains CLion, Visual Studio, and Eclipse offer native or plugin-based GoogleTest support.
  - They allow test discovery, run configurations, and breakpoint integration aligned with GoogleTest’s structure.

- **Test Runner Extensions:**
  - Various CI dashboards and local IDE plugins parse GoogleTest output formats, improving visibility of test results.

- **User Experience:**
  - Write tests once, run anywhere—using IDE GUI or command line.
  - Get direct links from test results to source code for immediate error inspection.

## Practical Example: Integrating GoogleTest in a Sample Project

Suppose you are adding GoogleTest to an existing CMake-based project.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add GoogleTest as a Subdirectory">
Clone the GoogleTest repository into your project’s `third_party` directory and add it as a subdirectory in your `CMakeLists.txt`.
</Step>
<Step title="Create Test Executable">
Add an executable target for your tests and link it against `gtest` and `gtest_main`.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable and Register Tests">
Invoke `enable_testing()` and use `add_test()` to register your test executable with CTest.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Tests">
Use `ctest` or run the test executable directly. Use command-line flags like `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests, or `--gtest_output` to generate reports.
</Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup>
```cmake
add_subdirectory(third_party/googletest)
add_executable(my_tests my_tests.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest gtest_main)
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

```bash
# Run all tests
./my_tests

# Run a subset
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*

# Generate XML report
./my_tests --gtest_output=xml:results.xml
```
</CodeGroup>

## References to Sample Code and Configurations

To help users get started quickly, the documentation includes:

- Sample code snippets demonstrating GoogleTest’s usage with multiple build systems.
- Example configuration files showcasing typical build and CI setups.

Concretely, the GoogleTest repo includes sample test cases and CMake/Bazel files illustrating real-world integration.

---

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always configure GoogleTest integration before writing tests to avoid build and runtime issues.
- Use the recommended test naming conventions to avoid conflicts.
- Leverage test filters and disabled tests to manage test suites effectively during development.
- Utilize generated test reports for thorough CI analysis.

---

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

- Ensure your build system links GoogleTest libraries correctly.
- Verify environment variables and flags in your CI to accurately capture test results.
- If using IDEs, check plugin version compatibility with your GoogleTest version.
- Consult the [Platform & Toolchain Support](/overview/integration-and-ecosystem/platform-support) page to confirm environment prerequisites.
