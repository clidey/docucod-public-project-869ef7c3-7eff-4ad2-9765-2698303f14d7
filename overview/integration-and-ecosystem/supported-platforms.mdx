# Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to provide a robust, portable C++ testing framework that works consistently across a wide range of platforms, compilers, and build systems. This page summarizes the officially supported platforms and compilers, outlines compatibility policies, and points users to the most up-to-date matrices and resources for detailed support information.

## Why Platform Support Matters

Ensuring your tests run reliably across different operating systems and compiler toolchains is critical for maintaining cross-platform codebases. GoogleTest's broad platform support helps developers:  

- Focus on writing effective tests without worrying about portability issues.
- Integrate testing seamlessly into existing build and CI systems.
- Avoid platform-specific pitfalls when writing or running tests.

As a user, understanding which environments are officially supported ensures you get maximum compatibility and access to community-tested configurations.

## Officially Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to determine the platforms and compilers it supports. These supported environments are continuously updated to reflect modern industry standards and community needs.

### Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest works on:

- **Linux** (including various distributions)
- **Windows** (especially Windows Desktop and MinGW)
- **macOS** (including iOS for testing on Apple platforms)
- **FreeBSD**
- **OpenBSD**
- **QNX**
- Other BSD variants where applicable

Notably, some platforms like Fuchsia are either experimental or not officially supported.

### Compiler Support

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17 capable compiler. Supported compilers generally include:

- GCC (version aligned with C++17 support)
- Clang
- MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 and later with C++17 support)

Compiler support is closely tied to platform support to ensure stable builds and runtime behavior.

### Build Systems

GoogleTest officially supports integration with popular build environments:

- **CMake:** The primary community-supported build method, works across all major platforms.
- **Bazel:** GoogleTest provides native Bazel build configurations matching supported platforms.
- **Makefiles and other systems:** Via CMake or manual configuration, GoogleTest can be included in diverse build setups.

## Compatibility Policies

### C++ Standard

GoogleTest requires at least C++17. This ensures access to modern language features and guarantees compatibility with the standard library behaviors assumed throughout GoogleTest's codebase.

### Threading Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms where `pthreads` are available and enabled.
- On Windows, thread safety is supported using native threading APIs.
- For environments lacking thread support, GoogleTest falls back to a single-threaded mode with limited capabilities.

### Runtime Libraries and Options

- On Windows, GoogleTest provides options to choose between static and dynamic runtime libraries to prevent linking conflicts.
- Users can tweak threading and linking behavior via compiler flags, adapting GoogleTest to their environment.

## Checking Up-to-Date Platform Support

Due to frequent changes in compilers, OS versions, and IDEs, the authoritative up-to-date source for detailed platform and compiler compatibility is the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

This matrix provides:
- Verified versions of compilers supported per OS
- Supported build tools and versions
- Notes on deprecations, exceptions, or partial support

We highly recommend consulting this matrix before setting up your testing environment to ensure full compatibility.

---

## Practical Integration Tips

- **Use CMake for Cross-Platform Builds:** GoogleTest ships with a comprehensive CMakeLists.txt that handles platform-specific concerns, compiler flags, and installation.

- **Leverage Package Managers:** Some platforms provide GoogleTest packages that adhere to these compatibility notes.

- **Manual Adjustments for Special Environments:** When building on less common configurations (e.g., embedded systems), be prepared to define or override threading or feature macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`.

- **Stay Updated:** Follow the GoogleTest GitHub repository and changelogs for any updates to platform support or major policy changes.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform Support Questions">
<Accordion title="Does GoogleTest support macOS/iOS?">
Yes, GoogleTest fully supports macOS desktop platforms with C++17-enabled compilers. iOS is also supported, enabling testing within Apple mobile development environments.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if my platform is not officially supported?">
GoogleTest might still compile and run, but without official guarantees. For critical projects, consider using supported platforms or contributing patches if you require official support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use GoogleTest with older C++ standards?">
No, GoogleTest requires C++17 due to language features it depends on. Using older standards may lead to build errors or unstable behavior.

## Next Steps

To proceed with integrating GoogleTest in your environment, consider:

- Reviewing the detailed [Getting Started with GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs) guides.
- Examining the [Installation & Setup](../../../getting-started/installation-setup/installation-methods) documentation for build instructions targeting your platform.
- Consulting the [pkg-config](../../docs/pkgconfig.md) guide for advanced build system integration tricks.

With a clear understanding of your supported platform and compiler, you are well positioned to reliably incorporate GoogleTest and reap the benefits of systematic, portable C++ testing.
