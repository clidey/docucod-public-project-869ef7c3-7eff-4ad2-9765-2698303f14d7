# Key Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational page of GoogleTest's documentation — the gateway to mastering the core vocabulary crucial for writing, reading, and extending tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you are new to the framework or looking to solidify your understanding, this page demystifies essential terms and concepts that underpin effective test creation and maintenance.

## Understanding the Building Blocks of GoogleTest

Before diving into writing tests, it's vital to grasp the key concepts used throughout GoogleTest. These terms form the language you'll speak when defining tests, crafting mocks, and setting expectations.

### Test Case and Test

- **Test Case:** A grouping container representing a suite or collection of related tests. It organizes tests logically, usually by functionality or class.
- **Test:** The individual unit of testing, encapsulated as a function that verifies a particular behavior or feature of your code.

By structuring tests within test cases, GoogleTest enables efficient organization and targeted execution.

### Assertions

Assertions are statements within tests that express expected outcomes. GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertion macros to validate conditions. For example, `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` checks if two values are equal and reports failures without aborting the test, whereas `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` aborts the current test if the condition is false.

#### Usage tip:
Use assertions to verify invariants and program correctness precisely; choosing the right assertion type is key to controlling test flow and clarity.

### Test Fixtures

A **Test Fixture** sets up a common environment shared by multiple tests within a test case. It allows:

- Initialization of shared objects or state before each test.
- Clean-up after each test execution.

By inheriting from `testing::Test` and overriding `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`, fixtures help reduce repetition and increase clarity when tests operate on similar contexts.

### Matchers

Matchers define flexible criteria to validate function or method arguments in mock expectations or assertions. Instead of expecting exact values, matchers allow you to specify patterns or conditions, such as "any value", "greater than 5", or "a string starting with 'foo'".

Common matchers include:

- `_` (wildcard matcher - matches any argument)
- `Eq(expected)` (equals expected value)
- `Gt(value)` (greater than value)
- `Not(matcher)` (negation of a matcher)

You use matchers primarily with mock functions to specify which calls you expect.

### Mock Objects

Mock objects stand at the center of interaction-based testing. They simulate and mimic real objects' behavior, capturing calls made to their methods for verification.

GoogleMock provides powerful tools to:

- Define mock classes using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Set expectations on method calls with `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Specify default behaviors with `ON_CALL`.

Mock objects empower tests to assert not only outcomes but interactions, sequences, and arguments in fine detail.

### Death Tests

Death tests verify that your code terminates or "dies" in a controlled manner when certain error conditions occur (for example, assertions or fatal checks failing). GoogleTest provides macros like `ASSERT_DEATH` to run code that should cause the process to abort, capturing and matching output as needed.

Death tests help ensure robustness and safety in failure scenarios.

## How These Concepts Fit Together

Here’s a streamlined flow to help you see these concepts in action:

1. **Create Test Cases and Write Tests:** Define logical groups (`Test Cases`) and individual verification logic (`Tests`).
2. **Use Fixtures:** Apply common setup/cleanup routines for related tests to minimize duplication.
3. **Assert with Assertions and Matchers:** Validate expected states and inputs precisely.
4. **Mock Collaborators:** Replace dependencies with mocks to verify interactions.
5. **Set Expectations:** Control and verify mock behaviors with `EXPECT_CALL` and other clauses.
6. **Validate Edge Cases:** Use death tests to safely check how your code handles critical failures.

Working this way leads to well-structured, maintainable tests that improve code quality and confidence.

## Practical Examples

### Defining a Simple Test

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MathTest, AddsTwoNumbers) {
  int sum = 2 + 3;
  EXPECT_EQ(sum, 5);
}
```

### Using a Test Fixture

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryReturnsResults) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Query("SELECT * FROM users"));
}
```

### Creating a Mock and Setting Expectations

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockNetworkClient {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, SendData, (const std::string& data), ());
};

TEST(NetworkTest, SendsData) {
  MockNetworkClient mock_client;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_client, SendData(::testing::_))
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(true));

  bool result = mock_client.SendData("payload");
  EXPECT_TRUE(result);
}
```

## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Placing `MOCK_METHOD` in `public` scope:** Always define mock methods in the public section for accessibility by `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`.
- **Avoid overusing `EXPECT_CALL`:** Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behavior and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` to verify important interactions.
- **Matchers must be pure:** Ensure your matchers do not have side effects, as gMock may invoke them multiple times unexpectedly.
- **Use fixtures to avoid duplication:** When tests share setup code, encapsulate in fixtures to keep tests concise.
- **Sequence control:** Use `InSequence` or `After` to specify call order when order matters, avoiding brittle tests.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compilation errors with MOCK_METHOD macro">
-Make sure types with commas (e.g., `std::pair<int, int>`) are either wrapped in parentheses or use type aliases to avoid macro parsing errors.
-Example:
```cpp
using PairInt = std::pair<int, int>;
MOCK_METHOD(PairInt, GetPair, ());
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="'Uninteresting mock function call' warnings">
- This warning indicates a mock method was called without an `EXPECT_CALL`.
- To suppress it, either add an `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` or use a `NiceMock` to silence unnecessary warnings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected call failures">
- Occur when a mock call does not match any `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Verify the arguments and matchers; ensure the expected calls are correctly set.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
