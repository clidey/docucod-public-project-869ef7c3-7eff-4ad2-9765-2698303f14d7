# Quick Feature Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock together provide a powerful, user-friendly framework for C++ unit testing and mock object creation. This page offers a concise summary of major features that simplify your testing workflow, from automatic test discovery and flexible assertions to advanced mocking capabilities.

## Seamless Automatic Test Discovery

Forget about tedious manual test registration. GoogleTest automatically identifies and runs all tests in your codebase, letting you focus entirely on writing tests rather than maintaining test harnesses.

## xUnit-Compatible Structure

GoogleTest embraces the well-known xUnit architecture familiar to developers from many languages. It supports test cases, test fixtures, and test suites, providing a solid, intuitive foundation for organizing your tests.

## Rich and Custom Assertions

Express precise test conditions using GoogleTest’s comprehensive set of assertion macros for equality, relational checks, string comparisons, exceptions, and more. Additionally, you can define your own custom assertions tailored to your domain-specific needs.

## Advanced Death Tests

Test how your code handles fatal failures securely and reliably by writing death tests. GoogleTest isolates these checks such that crashes caused by your tested code do not destabilize your test runner.

## Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

Write more generalized tests with parameterized test fixtures that run the same test logic across different inputs or types. This reduces code duplication and increases coverage with minimal effort.

## Powerful Mocking Support with GoogleMock

Integrate GoogleMock seamlessly for creating mock classes with declarative syntax. Control mock behavior, set expectations on method calls, validate call order and counts, and mock overloaded or templated methods with ease.

- Define mocks quickly with `MOCK_METHOD` macros, supporting qualifiers like `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, calling conventions, and reference qualifications.
- Use expressive matchers to specify expected argument values or conditions.
- Specify cardinalities with `Times()` to dictate the expected number of calls.
- Control call sequences with `InSequence` and `After` clauses.
- Set default or explicit actions with `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` macros.
- Choose mock object behaviors using `NiceMock` (silences uninteresting call warnings), `NaggyMock` (default, warns), or `StrictMock` (treats uninteresting calls as failures).

## Summary of Benefits

- **Test Discovery & Structure:** Save time with automated discovery and familiar test patterns.
- **Expressiveness:** Craft precise assertions and expectations.
- **Reuse & Maintainability:** Use parameterized testing to reduce repetition.
- **Isolation:** Test failure-handling robustly with death tests.
- **Mock Integration:** Simplify complex dependency testing with flexible mocks.

### Practical Example: Expectation on a Mock Method

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::Return;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const));
};

TEST(ExampleTest, ReturnsCorrectSize) {
  MockFoo mock;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetSize())
      .WillOnce(Return(10));

  EXPECT_EQ(10, mock.GetSize());
}
```

In this example, the mock object is expected to receive exactly one call to `GetSize()` and will return `10` on that call.

#### Tip

Use the `--gmock_verbose=[info|warning|error]` flag to adjust the verbosity of GoogleMock informational messages, warnings, and errors to streamline your debugging experience.
