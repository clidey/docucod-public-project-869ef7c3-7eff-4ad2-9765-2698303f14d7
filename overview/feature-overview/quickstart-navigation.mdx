## Navigating Your Onboarding Journey

Choose a path that fits your background and needs:

### First-Time Test Writers
Your focus is learning what a test looks like and how to write one:
- Head to [GoogleTest Primer](/getting-started/first-test-execution-validation/writing-your-first-test).
- Once comfortable, practice by writing simple tests and running them.
- Use [Quick Validation & Troubleshooting](/getting-started/first-test-execution-validation/quick-validation-and-troubleshooting) if you encounter issues.

### Intermediate Users Exploring Mocks
You want to introduce mocks for dependency isolation and advanced verification:
- Review the [Using Mocks in C++ Tests](/guides/core-workflows/using-mocks-in-tests) guide.
- Complement with the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) for recipes and code examples.

### Advanced Users & Integration
