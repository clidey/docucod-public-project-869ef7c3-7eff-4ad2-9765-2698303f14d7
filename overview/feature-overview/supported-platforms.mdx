# Supported Platforms and Requirements

Ensure your development environment aligns with GoogleTest's supported platforms, compilers, and C++ language standards before integrating it. This page helps you verify compatibility, avoiding costly misconfigurations and streamlining your testing setup.

---

## Why Verify Supported Platforms?
Starting your integration with GoogleTest requires confidence that your operating system, compiler, and build environment meet the framework's requirements. This page guides you through these prerequisites so you can save time, reduce errors, and optimize your testing workflow.

## Supported Operating Systems and Environments

GoogleTest supports a broad range of operating systems, closely following [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). Supported platforms include:

- **Linux Variants:** Including but not limited to mainstream distributions.
- **Windows:** Desktop editions with MSVC or MinGW compilers.
- **macOS and iOS:** Both desktop and mobile Apple platforms.
- **BSD variants:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD.
- **Embedded and Specialized:** ESP8266, ESP32, nRF52 (Arduino-like), QNX, Fuchsia, and others.

<Note>
For a full, detailed, and up-to-date list, refer to the official compatibility matrix maintained by Google:

</Note>

## Compiler and Toolchain Compatibility

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ compiler supporting the C++17 standard. Compatible compilers include:

- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC):** Version 2017 Update 3 or later is recommended.
- **GCC:** Version 7 or newer.
- **Clang:** Recent releases supporting C++17 features.
- **Intel LLVM:** Supported when configured properly.

Additionally, GoogleTest build scripts and rules for both **CMake** and **Bazel** recognize platform-specific compiler flags and linker options to facilitate builds across supported targets.

<Info>
GoogleTest leverages compiler and platform detection macros internally (e.g., `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`) to adapt features, warnings, and threading models accordingly.
</Info>

## Minimum C++ Standard Requirement

GoogleTest requires C++17 as the minimum language standard. This ensures availability of modern language features that GoogleTest depends on for robust template metaprogramming, type traits, and finer control over compiler diagnostics.

### Ensuring C++17 Compliance

- When using **CMake**, set the following in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If adding compiler flags manually, append:

```bash
-std=c++17
```

- Note that some platforms require additional flag tweaks for exception handling or runtime library linkage to ensure compatibility.

<Tip>
If your project or toolchain defaults to an older C++ standard, explicitly enforcing C++17 is critical to avoid build failures.
</Tip>

## Build System and Configuration Notes

### CMake

- GoogleTest provides a [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) script that supports cross-platform builds.
- By default, GoogleMock is built alongside GoogleTest; disable with `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` if only GoogleTest is needed.
- For seamless integration, your project can add the GoogleTest source as a subdirectory or use CMake's `FetchContent` to retrieve and build GoogleTest on demand.

### Bazel

- Bazel build targets define platform-specific config settings such as `windows`, `qnx`, and settings for compilers like MSVC.
- Library targets like `gtest` and `gtest_main` provide appropriate linkage and compile-time flags based on platform detection.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Runtime Library Mismatches on Windows:** 
  Visual Studio projects often default to dynamic runtimes, but GoogleTest defaults to static linkage. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` option in CMake if needed to align runtimes and avoid linker errors.

- **Pthread Support:** 
  GoogleTest relies on pthreads where available for thread safety. On MinGW or some embedded platforms, pthread support might be missing or partial. Check the `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro in your environment.

- **Shared vs Static Libraries:** 
  Building GoogleTest as a shared library requires defining the `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` macro. Linking tests against shared GoogleTest binaries requires `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`.

- **Environment Variables and Macros:**
  GoogleTest can be configured to enable or disable particular features via compile-time macros prefixed with `GTEST_`. For platform-specific quirks or advanced configuration, defining these macros in your build system can ensure proper behavior.

## Summary

Before investing effort into GoogleTest integration, verify your environment against the supported platforms, compilers, and C++ standards listed here. Use the authoritative external compatibility matrix and build instructions as your primary references. This preparatory step guarantees smoother integration and a more efficient testing workflow.

<Tip>
If you encounter environment-specific build issues, check for macro overrides such as `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` or `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to tailor GoogleTest to your platform.

### Example: Enforcing C++17 in CMake for GoogleTest

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(your_project_name)

# Enforce C++17 standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add GoogleTest as a subdirectory or FetchContent accordingly
add_subdirectory(third_party/googletest)

add_executable(your_test_exe test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(your_test_exe gtest_main)
```

This ensures your tests compile with the correct language standard and link against GoogleTest properly.
