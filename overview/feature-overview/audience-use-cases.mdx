# Target Audience & Common Use Cases

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are essential tools for C++ developers looking to build reliable, maintainable, and well-tested software. This page is dedicated to helping you identify whether this testing framework fits your needs by clearly outlining who benefits most from these tools and illustrating common scenarios where they shine.

## Who Should Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

### 1. Library and Framework Authors
If you develop reusable C++ libraries or frameworks, thorough testing is crucial to ensure API stability and correctness. GoogleTest simplifies writing unit tests, while GoogleMock empowers you to simulate and verify interactions with dependencies, helping you create robust, loosely coupled modules.

*Example:* Testing a networking library that depends on socket interfaces — you can mock socket calls to validate behavior without requiring a real network.

### 2. Application Developers
Enterprise and embedded application teams benefit hugely from GoogleTest and GoogleMock by isolating components under test and simulating complex collaboration patterns.

*Example:* Mock your database access layer to test business logic without needing an actual database.

### 3. Maintainers of Legacy Codebases
When introducing testing to legacy systems, GoogleMock helps you create dependency harnesses for hard-to-isolate components by mocking collaborators that are complex or unavailable.

*Example:* Wrap hard-coded dependencies in interfaces and mock them to incrementally add tests without rewriting the entire system.

### 4. Open Source Project Maintainers
Robust testing attracts contributions by enforcing consistent behavior and detecting regressions early. GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a widely recognized and trusted system for C++ test creation.

*Example:* Provide a suite of mocks for your project’s interfaces to help contributors write tests for new features.

### 5. Continuous Integration (CI) and DevOps Teams
GoogleTest's automatic test discovery and detailed reporting integrate seamlessly into CI workflows, making continuous validation of C++ codebases efficient and scalable.

*Example:* Automated runs of GoogleTest-based tests with mock behaviors verifying interaction sequences as part of your CI pipeline.

## Common Use Cases & Scenarios

### Interface-Driven Testing
Design your code to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Use GoogleMock to mock interfaces, enabling fine-grained control over the behavior of dependencies during unit tests.

```cpp
class Database {
 public:
  virtual ~Database() {}
  virtual bool Connect(const std::string& url) = 0;
  virtual int Query(const std::string& query) = 0;
};

class MockDatabase : public Database {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string& query), (override));
};

// Example test
TEST(UserServiceTest, ConnectsToDb) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("my://db")).WillOnce(Return(true));

  UserService service(&mock_db);
  EXPECT_TRUE(service.Initialize());
}
```

This approach promotes highly modular, testable code.

### Creating Test Harnesses for Legacy or Third-Party Code

Legacy systems or third-party libraries often lack interfaces or have tightly coupled implementations. GoogleMock's ability to mock non-virtual methods or design adaptor layers helps you isolate and test your code effectively.

*Strategy:* Design thin adaptor interfaces on top of legacy classes and mock those adaptors to perform tests without altering legacy code.

### Cross-Platform Application Testing

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support all major platforms and compilers, allowing consistent testing of platform-specific behaviors using mocks:

- Mock system APIs that differ per platform.
- Simulate network or hardware responses.

This ensures your application behaves correctly under various environments.

### Continuous Integration and Automation

Automate test execution with GoogleTest’s test discovery and detailed output formatting:

- Integrate with popular CI tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
- Capture detailed failure reports including mocked expectations.

Ensure fast feedback to developers by limiting tests to relevant components via selective test execution and mocking.

## Why Should You Care?

- **Increased Confidence:** Catch bugs early by thoroughly testing your code and its dependencies.
- **Better Design:** Encourages you to define clear interfaces, improving code maintainability.
- **Reduced Test Complexity:** Powerful mocking capabilities allow testing components in isolation without complex setup.
- **Faster Development Cycle:** Automated, fast, and reliable tests speed up refactoring and feature additions.

## Practical Tips for Getting the Most Out of GoogleTest and GoogleMock

- **Start by replacing critical dependencies with mocks** to speed up tests.
- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set precise expectations** and verify interactions.
- **Leverage `ON_CALL` to set default mock behavior** when interaction checks aren’t necessary.
- **Employ sequences and ordering constructs** when the order of calls matters.
- **Gradually introduce mocks in legacy code** to improve test coverage incrementally.
- **Run your tests with `--gmock_verbose=info`** to debug complex expectation failures.
