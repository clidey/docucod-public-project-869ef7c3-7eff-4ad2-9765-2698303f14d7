# Feature Overview at a Glance

Welcome to a rapid summary that introduces you to the core capabilities of GoogleTest and GoogleMock, focusing on five essential areas: assertion types, mocking with GoogleMock, test filtering, custom test runners, and flexible test initialization. This page is designed to orient new users quickly and help teams decide when and how to effectively deploy these powerful testing tools.

## Assertion Types: Verifying Code Behavior

At the heart of GoogleTest lie versatile assertion macros that validate program correctness by checking conditions during test execution. These assertions cover everything from fundamental boolean checks to complex value matching, enabling precise and expressive verification.

- **Boolean Assertions:** Simple checks like `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` and `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` confirm boolean logic.
- **Binary Comparisons:** Match values with `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, and related operators for equality and ordering.
- **String Comparisons:** Designed specifically for C-style strings, with `EXPECT_STREQ` and `EXPECT_STRNE` to compare content.
- **Floating-Point Comparisons:** Specialized assertions such as `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` and `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` handle the nuances of floating-point precision.
- **Predicate Assertions:** Enable custom predicates for detailed checks with `EXPECT_PRED` and `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT` families.

These assertions include both `EXPECT_` variants (nonfatal, continuing test execution) and `ASSERT_` variants (fatal, halting on failure), empowering you to manage test flow with granularity.


## GoogleMock: Powerful Mocking Framework

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest with a rich and fluent mocking DSL for C++, dramatically simplifying the creation and use of mock objects.

- **Declarative Mock Classes:** Using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro, mock classes are easy to define and maintain.
- **Setting Expectations:** `EXPECT_CALL` lays out the expected calls, argument matchers, call ordering, and cardinalities to precisely specify interactions.
- **Default Actions:** Control default mock behavior using `ON_CALL` without adding strict call expectations.
- **Ordering and Sequences:** Use `InSequence` and `After` clauses to impose call order constraints, from strict orders to DAG-based partial orders.
- **Strictness Control:** Choose between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` wrappers to control how unexpected or uninteresting calls behave and are reported.
- **Advanced Matchers and Actions:** Leverage built-in and custom matchers to flexibly validate argument properties and actions to specify mock responses.

GoogleMock also supports mocking of overloaded functions, non-virtual methods (via separate mock classes), and move-only types, accommodating modern C++ patterns.

## Test Filtering: Selective Test Execution

GoogleTest allows you to focus on relevant tests through powerful filtering options:

- Run only tests matching patterns using the `--gtest_filter` flag,
- Combine positive and negative filters to precisely target test subsets,
- Exclude flaky or platform-specific tests during regular runs,
- Integrate filters seamlessly with existing test runners and CI systems.

This makes test execution efficient, especially for large projects.

## Custom Test Runners: Extending Control

GoogleTest supports custom runners to suit complex testing workflows:

- Implement your own main routine to customize initialization and shutdown.
- Control test execution order and timing.
- Integrate with other frameworks or testing infrastructures.
- Use listeners and event hooks to capture detailed test results or generate custom reports.

This flexibility enables GoogleTest to fit smoothly into varied development and CI pipelines.

## Flexible Test Initialization

GoogleTest provides multiple ways to set up tests for consistent and reproducible results:

- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) to set per-test setup and teardown logic.
- Parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) allow running the same test logic with different data.
- Global setup and teardown via `TestEventListeners` and environment classes.
- Support for death tests, allowing controlled tests of error conditions.

These features help you organize tests clearly and maintainably.

### Practical Example: Using GoogleMock Expectations

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, CanDrawCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
      .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));

  // Code under test would use the turtle here
  // and the expectations above verify the interaction.
}
```

This succinct example showcases mock setup and expectations, highlighting the core power of GoogleMock to validate interactions precisely.

Use this Feature Overview as a compass to quickly grasp the essential tools available and start harnessing the power of GoogleTest and GoogleMock in your C++ development workflow.


<AccordionGroup title="Quick Tips & Best Practices">
<Accordion title="Start With ON_CALL">
Most of the time, you want to use `ON_CALL` to set default mock behaviors, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` only for those interactions you want to verify explicitly to avoid brittle tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Control Strictness with NiceMock / StrictMock">
Choose `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, or `StrictMock` to make them errors. Use `NaggyMock` for warnings. This helps you keep tests tidy and focused.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use Sequences to Enforce Call Order">
Use `InSequence` blocks or `.After()` clauses to specify expected call orders when order matters, preventing unexpected interaction bugs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Match Arguments Flexibly">
Use matchers like `_` (wildcard), `Eq`, `Ge`, `Lt`, and custom matchers to specify precisely what arguments the mock should expect.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Verify Early if Needed">
If a mock object is not destructed timely, force verification with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to avoid silent test bugs.
