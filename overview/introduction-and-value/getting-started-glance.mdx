## Next Steps: Your Getting Started Roadmap

### 1. Understand GoogleTest Basics

Start with a high-level introduction to GoogleTest to grasp its core purpose and capabilities.

- [What is GoogleTest?](../overview/introduction-and-value/what-is-googletest)
- [Target Audience & Use Cases](../overview/introduction-and-value/target-audience-use-cases)

This foundational knowledge helps you connect GoogleTest's strengths to your testing goals.

### 2. Check Your Environment

Verify your system meets the prerequisites needed for GoogleTest to work smoothly.

- [System Requirements](../../getting-started/introduction-and-requirements/system-requirements)

Understanding supported platforms and compilers upfront prevents unexpected roadblocks.

### 3. Install GoogleTest

Choose your preferred build system and install GoogleTest:

- [Installing with CMake](../../getting-started/installation-and-configuration/installing-googletest-cmake)
- [Installing with Bazel](../../getting-started/installation-and-configuration/installing-googletest-bazel)
- [Platform-Specific Setup](../../getting-started/installation-and-configuration/platform-specific-setup)

These pages walk you through step-by-step commands to integrate GoogleTest in your environment.

### 4. Write and Run Your First Test

Kick off your testing by authoring and executing a simple test case.

- [Writing and Running Your First Test](../../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/writing-and-running-your-first-test)
- [GoogleTest Primer](../../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/quickstart-primer)

These resources show you exactly how to structure tests, leverage macros, and validate outcomes.

### 5. Troubleshoot and Optimize

If you hit snags, we’ve got your back:

- [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/troubleshooting)

From build errors to runtime surprises, this guide helps you navigate and fix common pitfalls fast.

---

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple:** Don’t rush complexity. Begin with minimal tests and build up.
- **Use examples:** Look at the Getting Started guides and samples to pattern your approach.
- **Plan your mocks carefully:** Additional mocking support (GoogleMock) is tightly integrated but distinct—plan to dive into it when your tests require isolating dependencies.
- **Leverage references:** Use the API Reference and Concepts sections once comfortable for advanced features.
