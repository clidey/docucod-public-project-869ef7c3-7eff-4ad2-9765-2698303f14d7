# Core Concepts & Terminology

Mastering GoogleTest begins with understanding its foundational concepts and terms. This page breaks down key ideas such as test cases, assertions, fixtures, parameterized tests, and test discovery, empowering you to confidently interpret GoogleTest's documentation, source code, and examples.

## Understanding the Basics: Tests, Test Suites, and Assertions

In GoogleTest, a **test** is a function that checks a particular piece of code behaves as expected. You write a test by using assertions â€” statements that verify if certain conditions hold true.

Tests are organized into **test suites**, groups that logically cluster related tests. Each test suite can contain one or many tests, providing structure and clarity. For example, multiple tests verifying different behaviors of a `Factorial` function would belong to a `FactorialTest` suite.

Assertions come in two flavors:

- `EXPECT_*`: Nonfatal assertions that allow the test function to continue even if they fail, reporting multiple issues in one run.
- `ASSERT_*`: Fatal assertions that abort the current test function immediately on failure, preventing further execution to avoid cascading errors.

### Example: Writing Simple Tests

```c++
// Test suite: FactorialTest
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Here, `FactorialTest` is the test suite, and each `TEST()` macro defines an individual test. If any assertion fails within a test, the test is marked as failed.

## Organizing Tests with Fixtures

When multiple tests share common setup or data, GoogleTest provides **test fixtures**. A fixture is a class derived from `testing::Test` that sets up shared objects and state once per test, allowing reuse and reducing code duplication.

### Creating and Using a Test Fixture

1. Define a test fixture class:

```c++
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Prepare shared data
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};
```

2. Write tests that use the fixture with `TEST_F`:

```c++
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);
  ...
}
```

Each test cleans up after itself to ensure isolation, as a fresh fixture object is created per test.

**Tip:** Always use `TEST_F()` when testing with fixtures; mixing `TEST()` with fixture state leads to compilation errors.

## Parameterized Tests: Testing with Many Inputs

GoogleTest supports **parameterized tests**, letting you run the same test logic with multiple input variations without duplicating code.

This fits scenarios where you want to validate a function behaves correctly over a range of inputs.

Learn more in the [Effective Parameterized and Typed Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/best-practices-and-patterns/parameterized-testing.md) guide.

---

## Test Discovery and Execution

One powerful convenience in GoogleTest is **automatic test discovery**. Once you define tests using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, they are registered automatically. You don't need to manually list or invoke them.

Running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` executes every registered test, returning `0` if they all pass or `1` if any fail. This makes integrating tests into build and CI systems simple and reliable.

### Typical Test Execution Flow

1. GoogleTest gathers all tests registered via macros.
2. `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` runs each test in turn:
  
   - Creates the fixture (if any).
   - Executes the test.
   - Cleans up.

3. Summarizes results with detailed output.

**Important:** Always return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` value from your `main()` to propagate test success/failure status correctly.

## Summary of Core Terms

| Concept                | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test                   | A single function checking code behavior via assertions.                                      |
| Test Suite             | Group of related tests logically organized under one name.                                   |
| Test Fixture           | Class derived from `testing::Test` to share setup and teardown among tests.                   |
| Assertion              | Macro that verifies a condition (`EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*`).                                 |
| Parameterized Test     | Test that runs repeatedly with different inputs without code duplication.                     |
| Test Discovery         | Automatic registration and collection of tests defined via macros.                          |
| Test Program           | Binaries containing one or more test suites and tests.                                       |

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- Use `EXPECT_*` for checks after which continuing makes sense; use `ASSERT_*` to stop tests immediately on critical failures.
- Remember to name test suites and tests clearly and consistently, following C++ naming conventions.
- Avoid sharing mutable state across tests outside fixtures to maintain test independence.
- Always call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.
- For complex scenarios, leverage parameterized tests to avoid repetitive code.

**Note:** Because GoogleTest started with the term 'Test Case' to mean what is now generally called a 'Test Suite', be mindful of the evolving terminology. The newer preferred term is 'Test Suite', aligning with industry standards.
