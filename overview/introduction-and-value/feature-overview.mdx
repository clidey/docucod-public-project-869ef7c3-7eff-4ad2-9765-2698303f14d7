# Key Features at a Glance

Discover GoogleTest and GoogleMock's essential capabilities summarized for quick understanding and immediate relevance to your testing needs. This page highlights core features such as xUnit-style testing, flexible assertions, parameterized tests, mocking support, and test discovery mechanisms to help you rapidly identify the functionality that matters most.

---

## Why This Matters to You

Testing is much more than writing assertionsâ€”it's about crafting reliable, maintainable, and expressive tests that mirror the behaviors your code must support. GoogleTest and GoogleMock empower you to achieve that by providing a comprehensive, flexible toolkit that integrates smoothly into your C++ development workflow.

Whether you are verifying algorithm correctness, orchestrating integration tests, or simulating complex behaviors with mocks, this feature overview helps you quickly pinpoint key capabilities and how they bring value to your testing.

## Overview of Core Features

### xUnit-Style Testing
Write individual test cases using an intuitive, structured syntax based on the xUnit framework pattern. Organize your tests cleanly into test suites for easy management and scaling.

- Define tests with descriptive names that clarify intent.
- Support setup and teardown functions for per-test and per-suite resource management.

### Flexible Assertions
Assert expectations on your code outputs and behavior with a rich set of assertions that support:

- Equality and inequality checks.
- Exception and error condition testing.
- Compound, scoped, and predicate-based validations.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value);
ASSERT_THROW(func(), std::runtime_error);
```

### Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests
Run the same test logic over sets of data or types without duplicating code:

- Parameterized tests take inputs and run the test multiple times with different data.
- Type-parameterized tests allow testing across a set of types in templates.

### Mock Support with GoogleMock
Simulate and control interactions with dependencies using mocks:

- Define mock classes easily with the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Set expectations on method calls, including order and cardinality.
- Specify default actions and custom return behaviors.
- Support for mocking overloaded, const, and template methods.

Example:
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x), (override));
};

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5)).WillOnce(Return(10));
```

### Test Discovery and Execution
GoogleTest automatically discovers tests in your binaries and executes them with detailed reports:

- Write many individual tests without manually registering them.
- Support filtering test runs for focused debugging.
- Provide rich, customizable output formats.

### Additional Testing Utilities

- Support for sequences and ordered expectations to verify call order.
- Integration with existing build and CI systems.
- Compliance with modern C++ standards and platforms.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you have a complex system that communicates with an external service. You want to:

1. Verify your internal logic under a variety of inputs.
2. Ensure the service interaction occurs with expected arguments.
3. Handle exceptional scenarios gracefully.

With GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- You write parameterized tests to cover input variations.
- You create mock service classes that expect specific calls, using flexible matchers.
- You specify behaviors for mocks that simulate error responses.

This approach gives you confidence your code behaves correctly under all relevant scenarios, with minimal reliance on costly or flaky external systems.

## Tips for Effective Use

- Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior for mocks, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying important interactions.
- Leverage sequences (`InSequence`) to enforce call order when needed.
- Opt for parameterized tests to reduce duplication and improve coverage.
- Employ verbosity flags (`--gmock_verbose`) for deeper insights when debugging mock calls.
