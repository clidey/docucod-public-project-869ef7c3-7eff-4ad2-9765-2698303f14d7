# What is GoogleTest?

## Unlocking Reliable, Expressive C++ Testing

GoogleTest is a premier C++ testing framework that unifies automated testing with rich expressiveness and reliability. Born from Google's own rigorous requirements, and now merged seamlessly with GoogleMock, GoogleTest empowers developers to write automated, repeatable tests that scale from small modules to large applications.

### Why GoogleTest Matters to You

- **Automated, Repeatable Testing**: Run thousands of tests quickly and consistently with simple macros, letting you catch regressions early.
- **Expressive Assertions**: Verify complex conditions clearly with a variety of built-in assertion macros and custom matcher support.
- **Robust Test Organization**: Group tests logically into suites and fixtures, reusing setup code and improving maintainability.
- **Supports Parameterized and Typed Tests**: Run the same test logic across different inputs and data types without code duplication.
- **Detailed Failure Reporting with Context**: Failures include rich information, file/line annotation, and stack traces, simplifying debugging.
- **Cross-Platform Portability**: Runs reliably on Linux, Windows, and Mac, making your tests widely usable.

### Who Uses GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is trusted by Google itself, the Chromium project, LLVM compiler, Protocol Buffers, OpenCV, and numerous other high-profile projects. If you're writing C++ software and need reliable testing, GoogleTest is the industry-standard.

## What Is GoogleTest?

Simply put, GoogleTest is a C++ testing framework designed to help you write robust, maintainable test programs. It merges the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects to offer a comprehensive test-and-mock solution.

At its core, GoogleTest allows you to write tests using simple macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()` for parameterized tests. It manages test execution, reporting, and failure handling automatically.

### Core Purpose

GoogleTest solves the challenge of verifying your C++ code's correctness efficiently and reliably:

- It enables **automated, repeatable tests** that isolate each test’s execution.
- Provides expressive, clear **assertions** to specify expected behavior.
- Facilitates **organization** via test suites and fixtures, helping you manage tests at scale.
- Supports **parameterization** to reduce duplication and increase coverage.

### How GoogleTest Works

- You write individual tests as macros, grouping related tests into suites.
- GoogleTest runs each test separately, reporting the outcome.
- Failures include detailed messages, stack traces, and optional test traces.
- Supports rich parameterization and type-driven test patterns.

These capabilities combine to reduce bugs, improve confidence, and speed up development cycles.

## Key Features of GoogleTest

### 1. Simple Test Definitions with `TEST` and `TEST_F`
Write focused tests with `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` or use `TEST_F` with fixtures for shared setup:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  Queue<int> queue_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsItem) {
  int* item = queue_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(item, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*item, 1);
  delete item;
}
```

### 2. Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`)
Run the same tests with different input parameters without duplicating code:

```cpp
class StringLengthTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};

TEST_P(StringLengthTest, HasExpectedLength) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam().length(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(NonEmptyStrings, StringLengthTest,
                         testing::Values("hello", "world", "test"));
```

### 3. Typed Tests and Type-Parameterized Tests
Run tests across multiple data types to verify template behaviors.

```cpp
template<typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {
  T value_ = T();
};

using NumericTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, IsDefaultConstructed) {
  TypeParam n = this->value_;
  EXPECT_EQ(n, TypeParam());
}
```

### 4. Rich Assertions and Custom Matchers
Leverage a broad set of assertions (`EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_THROW`, and more) and extend with custom matchers for clearer failure messages.

### 5. Fine-Grained Test Control

- Skip tests dynamically with `GTEST_SKIP()`.
- Run subsets of tests using filters.
- Disable tests temporarily using the `DISABLED_` prefix.
- Generate XML/JSON reports for Continuous Integration systems.

### 6. Extensive Event Listener API
Customize test reporting by implementing event listeners to track test progress, results, and failures.

### 7. Support for Death Tests
Write tests that verify your code terminates as expected in critical failure scenarios.

## Why Should You Care About GoogleTest?

GoogleTest radically improves your development workflow by helping you catch bugs early, clearly identify what went wrong, and maintain confidence in changes.

### Practical Benefits

- **Speed**: Automate thousands of tests and integrate with CI to catch errors fast.
- **Maintainability**: Organize tests cleanly with suites and fixtures.
- **Quality**: Express complex test conditions precisely, reducing false negatives and positives.
- **Reusability**: Parameterize tests to avoid redundancy.
- **Portability**: Write once, run anywhere supported.

### Common Use Cases

- Unit testing functions, classes, and interfaces.
- Regression testing across versions.
- Data-driven testing with multiple inputs.
- Template and generic library testing for multiple data types.
- Ensuring code correctly throws exceptions or aborts (death tests).

### Before GoogleTest vs After GoogleTest

| Without GoogleTest                               | With GoogleTest                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Manually write ad-hoc checks and print logs.    | Write clear assertions that automatically report pass/fail.   |
| Tests tangled with complex setup code.           | Use fixtures to share setup across tests cleanly.             |
| Difficult to run tests selectively.               | Easily run single tests or filtered groups.                   |
| Hard to track test failures and debug quickly.   | See detailed failure messages and stack traces immediately.  |

## Getting Started Preview

To get started with GoogleTest:

1. Include `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` in your test files.
2. Define tests using the `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` macros.
3. Initialize the framework in your `main()` with `testing::InitGoogleTest()`.
4. Run all tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which returns `0` on success.

For example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(SampleTest, SimpleCheck) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Prerequisites

- Supported compilers with C++11 or later (GoogleTest 1.17.x requires at least C++17).
- Basic familiarity with C++ and compiling/linking libraries.

### Next Steps

Explore the [GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) to learn how to write your first test and use fixtures effectively.

Then dive into [Writing and Running Tests](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/testing.html) to master the various test macros and assertion types.
