# Supported Platforms & Integrations

Explore the range of environments in which GoogleTest excels, including its support for diverse platforms, compilers, and build tools. This guide also outlines how GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) systems, code editors, and related tools. Furthermore, learn about GoogleTest's relationship with other complementary testing projects and extensions, positioning it as a versatile tool in your testing ecosystem.

## Platform Support

GoogleTest is designed for broad portability, supporting a wide variety of operating systems and compilers. This enables your tests to run consistently across different environments—from your developer workstation to complex CI infrastructure.

### Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports numerous platforms, including but not limited to:

- **Linux** (including Android)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants)
- **Mac OS X** (with special consideration for iOS)
- **Popular UNIX-like systems:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX
- **Emerging and niche platforms:** Fuchsia, GNU/Hurd, DragonFlyBSD, Haiku

The framework detects the platform automatically using environment-indicating macros to provide optimized support for each system. For instance, threading, exceptions, and file system capabilities adjust based on the underlying platform.

### Compiler Compatibility

All major C++ compilers that support C++17 or later work with GoogleTest. Some of these include:

- GCC (with version detection for features like RTTI, exceptions)
- Clang (including Apple’s LLVM variants)
- Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC 2017 Update 3 or later)
- Intel C++ Compiler

To ensure compatibility, GoogleTest evaluates compiler features such as exception handling, RTTI availability, and platform-specific extensions. This means users rarely have to manually configure these settings.

### Build Tools

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with common build tools and environments, including:

- **CMake:** Out-of-the-box support with official scripts simplifying project integration (see [googletest/README.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/README.md#build-with-cmake)).
- **Make and Ninja:** Supported on **nix systems and seamlessly invoked via CMake.
- **Visual Studio Projects:** Automatically generated `.sln` files for Windows developers.
- **Embedded systems:** Partial support where threading and file system functionality are limited.

### Configuring for Your Environment

While GoogleTest automatically detects most platform details, you can customize behavior through macros defined in your build system, such as:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1      # Force pthreads support
-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1 # Build GoogleTest as a shared DLL
-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1 # Indicate test code is linking GoogleTest shared library
```

Such macros provide fine-grained control for unique build environments or embedded platforms.

## Integration with CI/CD Systems and Code Editors

GoogleTest fits naturally into modern development workflows, thanks to widespread support in popular CI/CD platforms and editor tooling.

### Continuous Integration & Testing Automation

GoogleTest's design emphasizes ease of integration with common CI servers such as:

- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Travis CI

Its command-line interface supports running selected tests, reporting result statistics, and producing XML-formatted outputs compatible with CI dashboards and test reporting plugins. This helps teams automate testing efficiently.

### Code Editors and IDE Support

Many integrated development environments support GoogleTest frameworks directly or through plugins:

- **Visual Studio:** Built-in support to detect, run, and debug GoogleTest tests.
- **CLion:** JetBrains’ C++ IDE offers deep GoogleTest integration with clickable test results.
- **VS Code:** Extensions like GoogleTest Adapter & C++ TestMate discover and run tests with inline annotations.

This integration provides interactive test results, quick navigation to failing tests, and debugging capabilities, enhancing developer productivity.

## Relationship to Other Testing Projects and Extensions

GoogleTest is a cornerstone within a broader ecosystem of testing tools and libraries designed to complement and extend its capabilities.

### GoogleMock

GoogleMock is integrated tightly with GoogleTest to facilitate mocking of interfaces in C++. It:

- Enables declarative mock class creation.
- Supports expectation setting and verification.
- Is included within the GoogleTest repository, and is built alongside.

For detailed concepts and usage, see the [GoogleMock Overview](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/README.md) and the [Mocking Reference](docs/reference/mocking.md).

### Other Extensions and Frameworks

GoogleTest can be used alongside other tools for richer test scenarios:

- **Parameterized and Typed Tests:** Enable running suites of tests with different data sets or types.
- **Death Tests:** Facilitate validation of code that terminates via exceptions or aborts.
- **Custom Matchers and Actions:** Extend functionality with user-defined checks.

Many of these extensions are part of the core framework and come with integrated support for compatibility across platforms.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- When targeting cross-platform builds, verify your build system sets up platform-specific macros if your environment is non-standard.
- Use CMake's built-in support to simplify integration and ensure consistent options across platforms.
- Consider building GoogleTest as a shared library in large projects to speed up linking and reduce binary size, using the appropriate macros.
- Integrate GoogleTest outputs with CI dashboards by enabling XML report generation.
- Leverage editor plugins that recognize GoogleTest to accelerate your development and debugging workflow.

## Summary

GoogleTest's extensive platform coverage and integration capabilities make it a powerful and reliable choice for C++ testing across different hardware and software environments. Its seamless interoperability with CI/CD pipelines and code editors streamlines development workflows, while its close relationship with GoogleMock and support for various extensions ensure comprehensive testing coverage.
