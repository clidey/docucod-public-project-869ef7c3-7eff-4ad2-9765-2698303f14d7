# Common Use Cases

## Unlock the Power of Automated C++ Testing with GoogleTest

GoogleTest seamlessly integrates into modern C++ development workflows by addressing essential testing needs, helping you write reliable, maintainable, and fast tests.

Whether you're automating unit tests, running regression checks, enabling continuous integration workflows, or embracing test-driven development (TDD), GoogleTest empowers you to build software with confidence.

## Automating Unit Tests

Unit testing lies at the heart of quality software development — verifying the smallest units of code to catch bugs early.

GoogleTest automates this process by:

- **Automatically discovering** all tests written using its simple macros, eliminating tedious manual test registration.
- Running tests in **isolated fixtures** ensuring test independence—each test executes on a fresh object, preventing side effects.
- Allowing easy organization into named test suites that mirror your code components.
- Providing expressive and flexible assertions to verify behavior precisely.

### Example Scenario

Imagine testing a class `Calculator` with methods like `Add`, `Subtract`, and `Divide`. Using GoogleTest, you would write multiple individual tests ensuring each method works correctly under various inputs—getting instant feedback whenever a defect is introduced.

```cpp
TEST(CalculatorTest, AddsNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST(CalculatorTest, DividesNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_THROW(calc.Divide(10, 0), std::invalid_argument);
}
```

After writing the tests, running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` executes them all, automating comprehensive validation of your code's correctness.

## Regression Testing

Regression testing ensures that changes and new features do not break previously working functionality.

GoogleTest helps you maintain a robust regression suite by:

- Providing a clear and structured way to add tests as your code evolves.
- Supporting assertions that precisely report failure causes, enabling swift problem identification.
- Allowing tests to be re-run automatically with each build, ensuring regressions are caught early.
- Letting you **filter tests** so you can run only specific tests or test suites relevant for a given change.

### Practical Workflow

When you fix a bug in your code, you add a new test case to cover that scenario. This test stays in the regression suite forever. Every time the code changes in the future, these tests are automatically run by GoogleTest, alerting you if the fix is broken or reverted accidentally.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline Integration

Modern software development relies on continuous integration to keep code healthy.

GoogleTest integrates tightly with CI pipelines by:

- Supporting detailed **test reports**: GoogleTest can emit XML or JSON reports usable by CI servers for visualization.
- Enabling **parallel and sharded test execution** by supporting environment variable configuration for sharding.
- Allowing **test filtering and shuffling** to isolate or randomize tests for diagnosing flaky behavior.
- Providing **command-line flags** to control tests behavior and output formatting in automated environments.

### CI Workflow

Run tests on every commit or pull request automatically. If any test fails, the CI system reports a failure, blocking faulty code from merging.

This leads to shorter feedback loops, fewer bugs making it to production, and higher code quality.

---

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a development technique encouraging writing tests before code implementation.

GoogleTest facilitates TDD by offering:

- Fast compilation and test execution, keeping the TDD cycle tight.
- Parameterized tests enabling you to cover multiple inputs easily as you refine your code.
- Rich assertion macros so you can precisely specify expected outcomes.
- Facilities for writing death tests to verify that your code fails safely and correctly when misused.

### TDD Example

1. Write a test that describes the desired functionality, e.g., ``TEST(CalculatorTest, MultipliesNumbers) { ... }``.
2. See the test fail initially.
3. Implement the multiplication logic.
4. Run the test again; it passes.
5. Refactor the code and tests safely.

Repeat this cycle to evolve your system with confidence.

## Summary

GoogleTest is designed to address key testing scenarios in professional C++ development:

- Automating unit tests to ensure fundamental correctness.
- Running regression tests to prevent future breakage.
- Seamless integration into CI pipelines to enable rapid, automated validation.
- Supporting TDD practices for high-quality and maintainable code.

With GoogleTest, your tests become a productive part of the development process, promoting reliable, bug-resistant software.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Organize tests logically into test suites that represent modules or components.
- Use fixtures for shared setup to improve test clarity and reduce duplication.
- Leverage parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently.
- Always check test results' failures and fix issues promptly to keep your suite healthy.
- Complement GoogleTest with GoogleMock when mocking behaviors in unit tests are required.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Avoid writing tests that depend on one another, to maintain test isolation.
- Do not ignore the return value from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` as it indicates pass/fail status.
- Resist overusing `ASSERT_*` indiscriminately; prefer `EXPECT_*` where possible to run more checks per test.
- Keep death tests isolated to maintain reliability.
- Avoid naming test suites or tests with underscores to prevent macro name clashes (see [FAQ](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)).
