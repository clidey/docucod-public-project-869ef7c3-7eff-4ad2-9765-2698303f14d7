# Core Features at a Glance

Explore the powerful and versatile core features of GoogleTest, designed to streamline your C++ testing workflows. From its xUnit-based foundations to advanced capabilities like parameterized and death tests, GoogleTest provides robust tools to write expressive, maintainable, and effective tests.

---

## What You Will Learn
- How GoogleTest’s xUnit-based testing style helps structure tests clearly.
- The convenience of automatic test discovery to simplify running tests.
- Rich assertions to express test verification precisely and readably.
- Death tests for safely validating error and termination conditions.
- Parameterized tests that enable reusing test logic with varying data.
- Detailed output controls to understand test failures quickly.

---

## xUnit-Based Testing
GoogleTest builds upon the familiar xUnit testing framework style that organizes tests into suites and individual test cases.

- **Test Suites & Tests:** Write logically grouped test cases under test suites (formerly called test fixtures).
- **Setup & Teardown:** Share common setup and cleanup code easily using fixtures.
- **Macros:** Use `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()` macros to declare tests.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, SizeInitiallyZero) {
  std::vector<int> v;
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 0);
}
```

This style makes tests easy to read and consistent, ultimately supporting maintainability.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery
Forget the hassle of manual test registration. GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests declared via the macros and runs them when you execute your test binary.

- **No Manual Setup:** Tests are registered with GoogleTest’s internal registry upon program start.
- **Flexible Execution:** Run all tests or filter tests by name with command-line flags.

This feature streamlines test workflows and reduces boilerplate code.

---

## Rich Assertions
Express your test validation with a broad suite of assertions—letting you confirm expected behavior precisely.

- **Basic Assertions:** `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_TRUE()`, etc., for common checks.
- **Advanced Comparisons:** Use `EXPECT_THAT()` with expressive matchers for container contents, floating-point approximations, or custom logic.
- **Fatal vs Non-Fatal:** Choose between `ASSERT_` (abort test on failure) and `EXPECT_` (continue test).

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(vector<int>{1, 2, 3}, ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

Clear failure messages and rich checks help you pinpoint problems swiftly.

---

## Death Tests
Validate error conditions and ensure your code terminates correctly on fatal errors.

- **Use Cases:** Confirm that invalid inputs or states cause program termination as expected.
- **Separate Process:** Death tests run code in a separate process to avoid crashing the test runner.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(MyObj().Foo(nullptr), "null pointer detected");
```

This is vital for testing safety-critical behavior and error handling.

---

## Parameterized Tests
Reuse test logic across multiple data sets using parameterized and typed tests.

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test body with different input values.
- **Typed Tests:** Run tests over different types to validate template code.
- **Benefit:** Reduce duplication and improve coverage effortlessly.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers,
                         MyTest,
                         ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

This makes your tests concise and scalable.

---

## Detailed Output Options
GoogleTest offers configurable and detailed output to accelerate diagnosis:

- **Verbose Failure Info:** Including stack traces to locate failure points.
- **Test Filtering:** Run subsets of tests via simple command-line filters.
- **XML Output:** Export results in standard formats for CI pipelines.

This rich reporting improves your testing feedback loop.

---

## Putting It All Together
Imagine you're developing a mathematical library. With GoogleTest’s core features, you can:

1. Organize your test cases into suites related to math features.
2. Automatically run all tests without manual registration.
3. Check precise edge conditions with rich assertions.
4. Validate your library fails gracefully on invalid inputs using death tests.
5. Run the same tests with different numeric types via typed tests.
6. Effortlessly integrate with your CI workflow using XML reports.

GoogleTest’s core features empower you to achieve these goals efficiently with minimal overhead.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices
- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` & `ON_CALL` to precisely control mock behaviors in your tests.**
- **Balance between strictness and flexibility by employing `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` as needed.**
- **Structure tests to verify one functionality at a time for clearer failure causes.**
- **Leverage parameterized tests to avoid code duplication and improve coverage.**
- **Use detailed output flags (`--gtest_output`, `--gtest_filter`) to refine your test runs.**

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls
- **Missing test executions?** Confirm you used the correct TEST macros and linked test binaries properly.
- **Unexpected mock behaviors?** Review whether you used `EXPECT_CALL` correctly and whether default actions are set.
- **Death tests failing unpredictably?** Check environment stability and usage of death test macros only when necessary.
