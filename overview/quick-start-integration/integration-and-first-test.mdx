# Getting Started: Integration & Your First Test

Welcome to the essential first step in empowering your C++ projects with GoogleTest. This guide walks you through integrating GoogleTest into your development environment and creating your very first unit test. Whether you use CMake, Bazel, or another build system, you’ll find clear instructions and minimal examples that get you testing quickly and confidently.

## Why This Page Matters

In modern C++ development, thorough testing is the foundation of stability and quality. GoogleTest provides a robust framework to make writing, running, and maintaining tests straightforward. This page is your hands-on entry, showing how to add GoogleTest to your project and how to write a simple, meaningful test you can run immediately.

By the end, you will have integrated GoogleTest and executed a basic test that proves the setup works, paving the way for comprehensive, scalable test suites.

## Getting GoogleTest into Your Project

### Supported Build Systems
GoogleTest supports various build systems with direct instructions for the most popular:

- **CMake**
- **Bazel**

Depending on your build environment, the integration will vary slightly, but the end goal is simple: include GoogleTest’s headers and link against its libraries.

### Basic Build Instructions
#### Using CMake
1. Clone the GoogleTest repository or ensure it is available as a submodule.
2. Create a build directory inside your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure your project with GoogleTest included:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build your test executable:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. Link your test program with `gtest` and optionally with `gtest_main` which provides a `main()`.

#### Using Bazel
For Bazel users, add GoogleTest as a dependency using Bazel’s workspace and build files. Typically, you will:

- Include GoogleTest in your `WORKSPACE` file.
- Add `@com_google_googletest//:gtest` or `@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main` as a dependency in your `BUILD` files.

Refer to the official CMake or Bazel quickstart for detailed steps.

## Creating Your First Test Program

### Minimal Example
Here's a minimal "hello world" style test that you can compile and run once integrated with GoogleTest:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple function to test.
int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Define a test suite "AddTest" with one test "HandlesPositiveInput".
TEST(AddTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(5, 7), 12);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv); // Initializes GoogleTest
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();                 // Runs all tests
}
```

#### Explanation
- `TEST` declares a test function automatically registered with GoogleTest.
- `EXPECT_EQ` asserts that two expressions are equal. On failure, it reports but continues.
- `InitGoogleTest` processes any command-line flags.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS` triggers running all defined tests.

### Running Your Test
Build the above into an executable using your build system and run it. You should see output like:

```
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from AddTest
[ RUN      ] AddTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[       OK ] AddTest.HandlesPositiveInput (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from AddTest ran. (0 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

## Next Steps and Helpful Tips

- **Follow the Quickstart:** If you are using CMake or Bazel, consult the [Supported Platforms & Environments](../quick-start-integration/supported-platforms-environments) page for environment-specific configurations.
- **Write More Tests:** Expand from a single example to multiple series of test suites and fixtures.
- **Use Test Fixtures:** For grouping related tests and sharing setup/teardown code, explore using `TEST_F`.
- **Integrate into CI:** Start running tests automatically in your continuous integration pipelines.

<Tip>
When writing your first tests, avoid naming test suites or test cases with underscores (_) in their names, as this may cause subtle errors or clashes due to GoogleTest's naming conventions.
</Tip>

<Note>
If you need a custom `main()`, ensure you always call `::testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Otherwise, flags and proper initialization won't happen.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests Not Running:** Did you set up linking with the `gtest_main` library or provide your own main? Without one, the tests won't execute.
- **Compile Errors:** Make sure your compiler supports C++17 or newer, as GoogleTest requires it.
- **Multiple Test Suites in a Single File:** Ensure fixture class names and test suite names do not conflict.

For detailed diagnostics, see the [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-help/common-errors) page.

## Summary
This page equips you to start testing right away by:

- Integrating GoogleTest with your build system (CMake, Bazel).
- Creating a minimal test program that runs immediately.
- Understanding the flow from test declaration to execution.

Building upon this foundation, you can develop extensive test coverage with fixtures, parameterized tests, and advanced integrations.
