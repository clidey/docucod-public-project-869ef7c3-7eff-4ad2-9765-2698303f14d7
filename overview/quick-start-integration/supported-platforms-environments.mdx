# Supported Platforms & Environments

GoogleTest is designed to work seamlessly across a wide variety of compilers, operating systems, and continuous integration (CI) environments, ensuring robust and consistent test execution for C++ projects. This page summarizes the officially supported platforms and compilers, compatibility requirements, and guidelines for using GoogleTest in your development and CI workflows.

---

## Compilers Supported

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17-compliant compiler to build and operate correctly. The core team ensures compatibility with popular compilers on major platforms, including but not limited to:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) — widely used on Linux and other UNIX-like systems
- **Clang/LLVM** — particularly favored on macOS and some Linux distributions
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** — supported on Windows environments
- **Intel C++ Compiler (ICC/ICL)** — used in performance-critical or enterprise environments

For a full, up-to-date list of tested compiler versions and versions known to work, refer to Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the corresponding [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Key Requirements

- The environment **must support C++17 or later**. Attempts to build GoogleTest with earlier standards will fail.
- Some environments may require explicit flags or macros to enable features such as threading or exceptions.

## Operating Systems Supported

GoogleTest explicitly supports a broad set of operating systems commonly used in software development:

- **Linux** (multiple distributions and kernel versions)
- **Windows** (desktop editions including Windows 10 and later, Windows Server)
- **macOS** (including versions supporting iOS cross-compilation)
- **BSD Variants** (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD)
- **Embedded and Specialized OSes** (such as QNX, Haiku, Fuchsia, z/OS)

### Special Notes

- Support for **Windows Mobile**, **Windows Phone**, and Windows RT platforms is limited and may lack certain features.
- Embedded platforms like ESP8266 and ESP32 are recognized but have constrained feature sets.
- Some platforms (e.g., native clients, older Solaris versions) are supported but with caveats.

## Continuous Integration and Build Environments

To fully leverage GoogleTest's capabilities in automated testing pipelines, your CI environment should:

- Provide access to a supported compiler and underlying OS as detailed above.
- Handle dependencies such as pthreads on POSIX systems or appropriate threading libraries on Windows.
- Allow passing custom macro definitions if needed (e.g., enabling/disabling pthread support, exceptions).

### Common CI Tools Supporting GoogleTest

- Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI — all compatible when configured with supported build agents.
- Bazel and CMake build systems have first-class GoogleTest integration and can be easily incorporated into these CI tools.

## Compatibility and Configuration Macros

GoogleTest uses a set of macros to detect and adapt to the environment automatically. Users rarely need to define these manually, but overriding macros might be necessary when automatic detection fails.

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` — Enables pthread support on POSIX systems.
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` — Indicates whether exception handling is enabled.
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` — Indicates availability of RTTI (Run-Time Type Information).
- `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING` — Checks for `std::wstring` support.
- `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` — Determines if file system access is available.
- `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` — Enables I/O stream redirection, necessary for death tests or capturing output.

For detailed descriptions and how to tweak these macros, see the [Customization Points](googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md).

## Getting the Most Current Platform Support Data

Since platform capabilities and compiler versions evolve, always consult the following resources:

- [GoogleTest repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) — active issues and pull requests related to platform support.
- [Supported Platforms documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) — lists supported compilers and platforms.
- [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) — official policy on compiler and platform support.

## Summary of Compatibility

| Platform           | Compiler Example           | Feature Highlights                         | Notes                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Linux              | GCC, Clang                 | Full feature set, pthread enabled          | Default in most environments     |
| Windows Desktop    | MSVC                       | Exception handling, threading via native APIs | May need DLL vs static CRT flag |
| macOS/iOS          | Clang                      | Supports Apple toolchains                   | iOS targets have limited features |
| BSD Variants       | GCC, Clang                 | Similar to Linux support                     | Sometimes needs manual tweaks   |
| Embedded (ESP, QNX)| Various                    | Limited file system and threading support   | Some features disabled          |

## Best Practices for Platform Compatibility

- Always build with **C++17 or newer** standards.
- When building on Windows, be mindful of runtime linkage options (static vs dynamic CRT).
- Use the official GoogleTest CMake or Bazel build scripts to handle environment detection automatically.
- For custom environments, leverage the macros in `gtest-port.h` to configure support correctly.
- Regularly update GoogleTest to benefit from improved platform support and bug fixes.

## Example: Checking Thread Safety in Your Build

After including `<gtest/gtest.h>`, verify whether GoogleTest compiled with threading support enabled by inspecting the `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

#if defined(GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE) && GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE == 1
  // Thread-safe GoogleTest: safe to run tests in multiple threads.
#else
  // Single-threaded GoogleTest: run tests sequentially.
#endif
```

This ensures you understand how your environment affects concurrency support in tests.

## Troubleshooting Common Platform Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Platform Compatibility">
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Missing C++17 Support">
Ensure your compiler version and build flags enable C++17 or newer. For GCC, use `-std=c++17` or higher.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Failing Prematurely on Windows">
Verify runtime linkage consistency (`/MD` vs `/MT`) between your tests and GoogleTest library. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stream Redirection Not Working">
Check that `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` is enabled. This feature depends on file system and platform support, which some embedded environments lack.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Support Not Detected">
Force pthread support by defining `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` if your platform does have pthread but detection fails.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
