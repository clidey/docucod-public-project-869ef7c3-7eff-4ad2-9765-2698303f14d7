# Your First Test: Quick Start Journey

Welcome to your first hands-on experience with GoogleTest and GoogleMock! This guide is designed to lead you through the essential steps — from initializing the framework to observing your very first test pass or fail. By walking you through this quick start journey, we aim to lower the barrier to your early success and give you a comfortable launchpad for deeper exploration.

## Why Start Here?

Embarking on your first test can be daunting if the steps aren’t clear or appear complex. This page focuses on the *shortest path* to achieve a real, actionable outcome — running your first test — so you can see the power of GoogleTest and GoogleMock firsthand.

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Set up the testing environment correctly.
- Write and configure a simple mock class.
- Define expectations and default behaviors.
- Build and run your test.
- Interpret success and failure results.

Along the way, practical tips and pointers will show you where to go next for more detailed learning.

## Quick Overview of the Journey

### Step 1: Include and Initialize GoogleMock

Begin by including the core GoogleMock header and initializing the framework. This setup parses command lines and prepares all internal states.

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

> This single call, `InitGoogleMock`, sets up both GoogleMock and GoogleTest for running your tests.

### Step 2: Define a Mock Class

Create a mock class based on your interface or abstract class. Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro in the `public` section to declare mock methods that can be controlled and validated.

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Process, (int count), ());
};
```

> **Pro Tip:** Always ensure mocked methods are virtual in the base class and that destructors are virtual for safe polymorphism.

### Step 3: Set Up Default Actions and Expectations

Within your test, create a mock object and customize its behavior using two core macros:

- `ON_CALL`: Sets default behavior without requiring the call.
- `EXPECT_CALL`: Defines expected calls, their frequency, arguments, and outcomes.

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

TEST(FooTest, SimpleBehavior) {
  MockFoo mock;

  ON_CALL(mock, GetSize())
      .WillByDefault(Return(42));

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(5))
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(Return(true));

  // Exercise code that calls mock.GetSize() and mock.Process(5)
}
```

### Step 4: Build and Run Your Test

Compile your test binary, linking against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries. Running the test will automatically verify that all expectations have been met.

```bash
# Example build with CMake
cmake ..
make
./my_test_binary
```

A passing test shows clear validation that calls happened as expected. Failures provide detailed diagnostic messages highlighting mismatches and call order issues.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices for Your First Test

- **Start simple:** Write tests for one method at a time before combining multiple expectations.
- **Avoid over-specification:** Use matchers like `_` to express flexibility unless you need strict argument verification.
- **Prefer `ON_CALL` for common default behavior:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` only where call frequency or parameters matter.
- **Use sequences and ordering cautiously:** Start without order constraints, add only if the order truly matters.
- **Watch for warnings about uninteresting calls:** If you see messages about uninteresting calls, either add explicit expectations or switch to a `NiceMock` to suppress.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Troubleshoot

| Scenario                           | What Happens                          | What To Do                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Method in mock without expectation is called | Warning message is printed         | Use `NiceMock` or add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` |
| Test fails with "unexpected call"          | Method called with unexpected args | Review `EXPECT_CALL` argument matchers; check call parameters         |
| Test fails with "to be called X times"     | Expected call count wrong            | Adjust `Times()` or test logic causing calls                        |
| Build errors mocking methods                  | Incorrect `MOCK_METHOD` declaration | Ensure method signature and `MOCK_METHOD` parameters match base     |
