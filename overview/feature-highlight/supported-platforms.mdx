# Supported Platforms and Toolchains

GoogleTest is designed to provide a robust, portable C++ testing framework that seamlessly integrates into a broad range of development environments. This page reviews the platforms, compilers, and build tools supported by GoogleTest, highlighting how its flexible design enables effortless use across diverse operating systems and toolchains.

---

## Broad Platform Support

GoogleTest aligns with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring compatibility with widely adopted and actively maintained platforms. It automatically detects the platform it is compiled on and adjusts accordingly to provide platform-specific optimizations and features.

Supported platforms include:

- **Windows:** Desktop (including MinGW), Mobile, RT (Windows Store Apps), Phone, and Games.
- **Linux:** All major Linux distributions, including Android.
- **Mac OS:** Standard macOS as well as iOS.
- **Unix-like OSes:** FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, DragonFly BSD, GNU/Hurd, Haiku, QNX.
- **Embedded and Specialized:** ESP8266, ESP32, Native Client, z/OS, OS/2.

This comprehensive platform range ensures your C++ tests can run reliably in nearly any environment you target.

The platform detection is performed using predefined macros in the build environment, so no manual configuration is typically required.

## Compiler and Language Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compatible compiler to build and run correctly. It proactively checks the compiler's C++ language support, refusing to build if the environment falls short. Supported compilers include, but are not limited to:

- **GCC** (with version checks to handle specific warnings and features)
- **Clang**
- **MSVC** (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later)
- **Intel LLVM Compiler**
- **SunPro**
- **HP aCC**

The project offers configurable flags and macros to tweak compiler settings for optimal build behavior, such as controlling warning levels, exception handling support, and runtime library linkage.

<Tip>
When building on Windows with MSVC, GoogleTest defaults to static runtime linkage for stability, but you can enable dynamic runtime linkage with the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option if needed.
</Tip>

## Threading and Library Support

GoogleTest supports multi-threaded tests, leveraging threading libraries where available:

- Supports POSIX threads (`pthread`) on platforms where available and enabled.
- Provides appropriate synchronization primitives on Windows and other thread-safe environments.

Thread safety is automatically enabled based on platform detection. For environments where threading support is unavailable or disabled, GoogleTest gracefully reverts to a single-threaded mode, ensuring basic functionality.


## Build System Integration and Toolchains

GoogleTest provides versatile integration across popular build systems and toolchains:

- **CMake:** Preferred and official build method, with platform-aware CMake macros that automatically adjust compiler and linker flags.
- **Bazel:** GoogleTest ships with Bazel build configurations that detect platform flags and dependencies.
- **Manual:** For custom build setups, users can adjust compiler flags based on documented macros and environment variables.

### Pkg-config Support

GoogleTest offers pkg-config files that encode the necessary compiler flags, macro definitions, and linker settings to integrate easily into a variety of build systems. This ensures that users compiling and linking their tests automatically get the correct flags, including threading macros and system libraries like `-pthread`.


## Flexibility in Cross-Compilation and Embedded Environments

Pkg-config files and build system macros support cross-compilation schemes by allowing users to specify sysroots and prefix paths explicitly. This way, GoogleTest integrates seamlessly into complex environments like embedded systems or when targeting non-native platforms.

Users leveraging cross-compilation must:

- Set `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` to their sysroot directory.
- Configure `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` accordingly to find GoogleTest's `.pc` files within the sysroot.

This setup guarantees that compiler and linker flags point to the correct target environment paths.


## How GoogleTest Adapts to Your Development Environment

When you build or link GoogleTest, it automatically configures itself based on the detected platform and compiler features:

1. **Compilation Flags Adjusted:** Such as warning levels, exception support, and RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) availability.
2. **Threading Enabled or Disabled:** Based on platform capabilities and user flags.
3. **Platform-Specific Implementations:** Custom mutexes, file system utilities, and regex backends selected dynamically.

This automatic adaptation ensures minimal setup friction and maximizes out-of-the-box compatibility.

<Warning>
Certain platforms or compiler configurations might require you to define macros such as `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` or `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=1` manually if the automatic detection misfires.
</Warning>


## Troubleshooting Platform and Toolchain Issues

If your environment is not supported out-of-the-box, or if you encounter build errors related to platform detection or threading:

- Verify that your compiler supports C++17.
- Ensure correct flags for pthread or threading libraries are passed.
- Review environment variables for pkg-config paths.
- For Windows, check the runtime library linkage settings in your build system.

Refer to the [Validating Your Setup]( /getting-started/troubleshooting/validate-installation ) and [Troubleshooting Common Issues]( /getting-started/troubleshooting/common-issues ) pages for detailed diagnostics and solutions.

## Getting Started

To ensure smooth integration of GoogleTest with your platform and build tools:

- Confirm your development environment meets C++17 standards.
- Use the provided CMake build scripts or Bazel configurations to build and link GoogleTest.
- If using pkg-config, set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` or related sysroot variables correctly.
- Adjust flags like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` if your platform's threading support is unusual.

For comprehensive build instructions and customization, consult the [Build with CMake]( /getting-started/installation-configuration/install-cmake ) and [Building with Bazel]( /getting-started/installation-configuration/install-bazel ) guides.
