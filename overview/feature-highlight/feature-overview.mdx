# Key Features at a Glance

GoogleTest’s power is driven by its combination of core features designed to accelerate the creation, maintenance, and reliability of your C++ tests. This page offers a focused snapshot of the headline capabilities that make GoogleTest effective and developer-friendly.

## xUnit Architecture: Structured and Familiar
GoogleTest follows the xUnit architecture, providing a well-understood structure with test cases composed of test methods. This consistency helps developers organize their tests intuitively and leverage established best practices in unit testing.

## Automatic Test Discovery: Run Tests Seamlessly
Forget about manually listing your tests. GoogleTest automatically discovers all your test cases and test methods in your codebase. Simply build and run your test binary, and GoogleTest will find and execute all tests, reporting detailed results.

## Rich Assertions: Expressive and Powerful Validation
GoogleTest offers a comprehensive set of assertion macros that go beyond simple equality checks. You can assert on conditions, exceptions, string content, floating-point comparisons, and more, all with informative failure messages that help diagnose problems quickly.

## Custom and Death Tests: Handle Complex Scenarios
- **Custom Tests:** Write tests that cover your domain-specific needs or extend with your own assertions.
- **Death Tests:** Verify that your code correctly handles fatal failures (like crashes or calls to `exit()`) by asserting that certain code paths terminate the program as expected.

These features let you cover edge cases and fail-fast scenarios robustly.

## Flexible Mocking with GoogleMock: Mock Collaborators with Ease
GoogleTest includes the integrated GoogleMock framework, enabling you to:

- Define mock classes easily using intuitive macros
- Automatically generate mocks for interfaces and virtual methods
- Specify expectations on method calls, arguments, call counts, and order
- Use rich matchers to precisely verify interaction details
- Set custom return actions and behaviors

Together, these enable a powerful interaction-based testing style, ideal for isolating components and verifying their collaboration.

## Why These Features Matter to You
These headline features provide significant benefits:

- **Accelerate Testing Workflow:** Automated test discovery and powerful assertion macros eliminate boilerplate and manual overhead.
- **Increase Confidence:** Death tests and flexible custom checks empower you to write precise, reliable tests even for critical failure paths.
- **Simplify Collaboration Testing:** GoogleMock’s expressive mocking lets you precisely specify and verify interactions without brittle, hand-coded mocks.
- **Maintainability and Scalability:** Clear test structures and comprehensive feature sets support growing codebases and evolving test suites.

## Example: Auto Test Discovery and Mocking in Action
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// Interface to be mocked
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

// Mock class definition using GoogleMock
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

// Test using the mocked turtle
TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100)).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp()).Times(1);

  // Exercise code under test using mock
  turtle.PenDown();
  turtle.Forward(100);
  turtle.PenUp();

  // GoogleTest will automatically detect and run this test
}
```

This example shows how GoogleTest discovers and runs the test automatically, while GoogleMock verifies that the turtle’s drawing commands occur as expected.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use GoogleMock's `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers to control whether uninteresting calls warn or fail.
- For methods with complex argument lists, consider using simplified mock interfaces to keep tests readable.
- Apply death tests to catch and validate program terminations to ensure robust error handling.
- Take advantage of sequence controls (`InSequence`, `After`) in GoogleMock to verify call order precisely when needed.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:** If you see warnings about calls without expectations, consider adding a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL` or switch to `NiceMock`.
- **Mock Verification Failures:** Ensure all expected calls are made before mock destruction; use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` if needed to verify early.
- **Unexpected Calls:** Double-check argument matchers and call counts to avoid unexpected calls; consult verbose output with `--gmock_verbose=info` for detailed insights.

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start
Include the main header `<gtest/gtest.h>` or `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files, write `TEST` or `TEST_F` cases, build your test binary, and run it. GoogleTest automatically discovers and executes your tests.

### Prerequisites
Basic C++ knowledge, a compiler supporting C++11 or later, and familiarity with unit testing concepts.

### Where to Go Next
Explore the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) for step-by-step instructions on writing your first tests, and delve into the [gMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md) guide for mocking basics. After that, check out the [Mocking Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md) and [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md) for advanced usage.
