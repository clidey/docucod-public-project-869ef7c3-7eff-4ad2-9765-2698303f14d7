# Integration & Platform Support

## Seamless Integration with Build Systems

GoogleTest is designed for smooth integration with major build systems, empowering you to effortlessly incorporate robust testing into your development process.

### CMake Integration

- **Native Support**: GoogleTest provides well-maintained CMake scripts, allowing you to easily add GoogleTest and GoogleMock as dependencies.
- **Configurable Options**: Customize settings like shared/static library builds and test inclusion.
- **Sample Usage**:
  
```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include(GoogleTest)

target_link_libraries(your_test_target PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gmock)
gtest_discover_tests(your_test_target)
```

### Bazel Integration

- **Official Rules**: GoogleTest and GoogleMock include Bazel build definitions for straightforward setup.
- **Test Automation**: Run tests with native Bazel test commands, including parallel execution.

```bazel
cc_test(
  name = "your_test",
  srcs = ["your_test.cc"],
  deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main"],
)
```

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest supports a wide array of operating systems and compilers, making it versatile for both desktop and embedded environments.

- **Operating Systems**:
  - Linux
  - Windows (including Windows Mobile)
  - macOS and iOS
  - Embedded platforms (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32)
- **Compiler Compatibility**:
  - GCC
  - Clang
  - MSVC
  - Other standard-compliant C++ compilers

Extensive conditional support ensures platform-specific features and compiler idiosyncrasies are appropriately handled.

## Collaboration with External Libraries and Tools

### Integration with Abseil

- GoogleTest optionally leverages Abseil for enhanced utilities such as:
  - Advanced container support
  - Flags and command-line parsing
  - Failure signal handling and stack tracing

This collaboration boosts reliability and debugging capabilities if Abseil is available.

### Open-Source Test Runners

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with various test runners, supporting common workflows in open-source and enterprise environments:

- **Test event listeners** let you plug in custom reporting and IDE integration.
- **Output formats** include XML, JSON, and streaming support enabling CI/CD tools compatibility.

## Extensibility and Platform Compatibility

- **Custom Environments**: Easily define global setup/teardown logic for complex test scenarios.
- **Cross-compilation**: Support for cross-platform builds by abstracting platform details.
- **Mocking Architecture**: GoogleMock integrates tightly, providing powerful mock classes across all supported environments.

## Developer Experience Enhancements

- **Command Line Flags**: Fine-tune testing behavior (verbosity, filter patterns, retries) easily.
- **Integration Points**: Hooks to extend and customize test execution and reporting.
- **Thread Safety**: Supports multi-threaded test scenarios under controlled rules.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Troubleshooting and Tips">
<Accordion title="Building on Unsupported Platforms">
If you encounter build issues:
- Ensure your compiler is C++11 compliant or newer.
- Review platform-specific configuration flags.
- Consider consulting the community for patches or workarounds.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extending with Custom Test Listeners">
Implement the `TestEventListener` interface to customize test reporting and integrate with IDEs or CI systems.

<Tip>
For successful integration, always keep your build tools and dependencies updated to the latest supported versions of GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
</Tip>

<Note>
Leverage the test event listener interface to tailor test output and integrate with IDEs or automated pipelines seamlessly.
</Note>

<Warning>
Avoid mocking classes you do not own unless necessary; instead, use adapters to simplify maintenance and minimize test breakages.
</Warning>
