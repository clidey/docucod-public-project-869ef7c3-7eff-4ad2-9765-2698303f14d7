# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide for GoogleTest users, where we define and clarify the key terms and concepts that shape your experience with GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page serves as your compass for understanding what test suites, test cases, assertions, fixtures, death tests, parameterized tests, mocks, expectations, and matchers really mean—explained in accessible language to empower your testing journey.

## What Are Core Concepts?

When you write automated tests using GoogleTest, you will encounter a set of fundamental concepts that describe the structure and behavior of your tests. Understanding these terms is essential to writing clear, maintainable, and powerful tests. These concepts reflect your goals as a tester and help guide how tests are organized and executed.

## Key Terminology Explained

### Test Suite
A **test suite** is a named group of related tests. Think of it as a collection that organizes tests by the functionality or module they cover. Using test suites helps you logically group your tests and run them selectively.

- Formerly called a **Test Case** in GoogleTest, the term `Test Suite` is now preferred.
- For example, all tests for a `Calculator` class might be in a `CalculatorTest` suite.

### Test Case (Test)
An individual **test case** or simply **test** is a single verification scenario written as a function.

- It exercises a specific piece of functionality.
- Publicly, these are defined with the `TEST()` macro or `TEST_F()` with fixtures.
- The test passes or fails based on assertions inside.

### Assertion
An **assertion** is a statement inside a test that verifies a particular condition, such as whether two values are equal.

- Assertions can be fatal (`ASSERT_*`) or non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`), controlling test flow upon failure.
- Examples include `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_THAT`, etc.

### Test Fixture
A **test fixture** is a class derived from `testing::Test` that provides a reusable context for multiple tests.

- It allows sharing objects and setup/teardown code for related tests within the same suite.
- Use `TEST_F()` to write tests using a test fixture.
- The fixture ensures a fresh environment for each test, so tests stay independent.

### Death Test
A **death test** ensures that a piece of code terminates the process under specified conditions.

- Useful for testing assertions, error handling, or program termination.
- Declared using macros like `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH` with code and expected error messages.
- They run in a separate process to safely detect fatal termination.

### Parameterized Test
A **parameterized test** allows the same test logic to run with different input parameters.

- This avoids duplicating test code for varied inputs.
- Implemented with `TEST_P` and instantiated with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### Mock
A **mock** object is a test double that simulates behavior of complex real objects, letting tests observe interactions:

- Mocks verify that expected function calls happen with expected arguments.
- Created via gMock macros such as `MOCK_METHOD`.
- They help test components independently by controlling and verifying dependencies.

### Expectation
An **expectation** specifies how many times and with which arguments a mock method is expected to be called.

- Set with `EXPECT_CALL` in your test code _before_ exercising the mock.
- You can specify the number of calls (`Times()`), call order, and behavior when called.
- Violations cause immediate test failures with detailed messages.

### Matcher
A **matcher** defines a pattern or condition that a mock method’s argument must satisfy.

- Used inside `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` to specify argument expectations.
- GoogleTest provides powerful built-in matchers like `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `HasSubstr()`, etc.
- Custom matchers let you write intent-expressive tests checking complex conditions.

## How These Concepts Fit Together

When writing tests:

1. You group tests into **test suites** to organize them logically.
2. Use **test fixtures** to share setup among tests.
3. Within each **test case**, you set **assertions** that validate your code.
4. For tests involving dependencies, use **mocks** to simulate collaborators.
5. Set **expectations** on mocks to verify interactions.
6. Use **matchers** to precisely specify which arguments are acceptable.
7. Use **parameterized tests** for running the same test logic with many inputs.
8. For verifying program failures and terminating conditions, apply **death tests**.

By mastering these concepts, you write tests that are easier to read, maintain, and diagnose when failures occur.

## Linking Concepts to Implementation

For practical application, each concept is supported by specific GoogleTest components and files. Below are links to some of the key implementation details and references:

- **Assertions**: [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) — Macros such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_THAT`.
- **Test Suites and Fixtures**: [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) — How to write `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`.
- **Mocks and Expectations**: [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md), [gMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md), [gMock Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md) — Macros like `MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`.
- **Matchers**: [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md) — List and descriptions of built-in matchers.
- **Death Tests**: [Death Assertions](reference/assertions.md#death), [Advanced Guide (Death Tests Section)](advanced.md#death-tests).
- **Parameterized Tests**: [Advanced Guide (Value-Parameterized Tests)](advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests).

Understanding the user-focused definitions tied here allows you to advance with real-world implementation examples.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always set **expectations** on mocks _before_ exercising the tested code, as setting them afterwards leads to undefined behavior.
- Use **matchers** to specify only the arguments that matter—over-specification leads to brittle tests.
- Apply **test fixtures** to reduce duplication and share common setup.
- Use **death tests** judiciously to check for failure modes without destabilizing other tests.
- Prefer **parameterized tests** for scenarios testing the same code against diverse inputs.
- Understand the distinction between **uninteresting calls** (not expected but allowed) and **unexpected calls** (not expected and cause failure).
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls and `StrictMock` to treat uninteresting calls as errors.

## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Core Concepts">
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between a Test Suite and a Test Case?">
    The **test suite** is a group of related test cases, whereas a **test case** is an individual test function. GoogleTest has deprecated the older term "test case" in favor of "test suite" for grouping purposes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When should I use ON_CALL vs EXPECT_CALL for mocks?">
    Use **ON_CALL** to define the default behavior of mock methods without asserting the call must happen. Use **EXPECT_CALL** when you want to both define behavior and enforce that calls must occur as specified.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my mock method call causing &quot;uninteresting call&quot; warnings?">
    If a mock method is called without an **EXPECT_CALL** expectation and no special strictness setting, GoogleMock will warn. Use **NiceMock** to suppress these warnings if the calls are truly uninteresting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I tell if a method was called with specific arguments?">
    Use **EXPECT_CALL** with appropriate **matchers** specifying the expected arguments. If the mock method call does not satisfy the matchers, your test will fail with detailed diagnostics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are matchers and why are they important?">
    Matchers allow you to specify conditions on mock method arguments flexibly, improving test expressiveness and robustness. They can be simple wildcards or complex predicates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
