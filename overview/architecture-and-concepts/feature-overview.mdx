# Feature Overview

Unlock the power of GoogleTest and GoogleMock through their core capabilities designed to make C++ testing both expressive and efficient. This page surveys the principal features you'll interact with, focusing on user-centric benefits like automatic test discovery, expressive assertions, rich mocking APIs, and parameterized testing.

## Core Testing Features of GoogleTest

GoogleTest delivers a robust xUnit testing framework tailored for C++ developers, enabling you to write clear, maintainable unit tests that automate verification with confidence.

- **xUnit Test Framework Support**
  Write tests in a familiar structure using test cases and test suites. GoogleTest handles setup/teardown patterns elegantly with test fixtures, letting you reuse common code.

- **Automatic Test Discovery**
  Forget manual test registration. GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests in your binary, enabling effortless execution of targeted or full test suites.

- **Expressive Assertions**
  Validate conditions precisely with a rich set of assertions (`EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*`) that provide detailed failure messages.

- **Advanced Assertions**
  Use predicates, matchers, and composite assertions for nuanced verification of your test outcomes.

- **Parameterized Testing**
  Reduce duplication by running the same test logic with multiple data inputs via value-parameterized and type-parameterized tests.

### Example: Writing a Simple Test

```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, StartsEmpty) {
  std::vector<int> v;
  EXPECT_TRUE(v.empty());
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 0);
}
```

This automatic discovery and expressive syntax speed up test writing and maintenance, making tests clean and readable.

## Mocking Capabilities of GoogleMock

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest by offering powerful mocking facilities to focus on the interactions between components, decoupling dependencies and enabling precise behavior verification.

- **Declarative Mock Class Definition**
  Use the `MOCK_METHOD()` macro in your mock classes to generate mock implementations for virtual functions quickly and safely.

- **Expectation Setting via `EXPECT_CALL`**
  Specify how your mocks will be called — how many times, with what arguments, in what order — creating clear specifications of expected interaction.

- **Default Actions via `ON_CALL`**
  Define default mock behaviors without requiring a call count expectation, keeping tests flexible.

- **Rich Matchers for Arguments**
  Validate function arguments flexibly, from exact matches to complex predicates, ensuring your mocks respond to precise invocation patterns.

- **Cardinalities and Ordering Constraints**
  Control invocation counts with constructs like `Times()`, `AtLeast()`, `AnyNumber()`; impose strict or partial call order through `InSequence()`, `After()`, and sequences.

- **Actions and Side Effects**
  Define what happens when mock methods run. Return values, throw exceptions, call callbacks, or modify arguments dynamically.

- **Support for Overloads and Const Methods**
  Mock all method variants seamlessly, including const methods and overloaded functions, for full coverage.

### Example: Defining a Mock and Expecting Calls

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, UsesPenDown) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10);
}
```

This pattern lets you verify that your drawing code triggers the right calls with expected parameters, enabling interaction-based testing.

## Parameterized Testing

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests allowing you to run the same test logic against a variety of input values or types without duplication:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests**
  Define tests over input data sets, ensuring coverage across input ranges.

- **Type-Parameterized Tests**
  Test templates and generic code with multiple types.

This approach increases test coverage and reduces effort maintaining multiple similar tests.

## Why These Features Matter to You

With GoogleTest's xUnit framework, you achieve clarity, automation, and maintainability in verifying C++ code functionality. GoogleMock complements it by adding precision in testing component interactions, enabling faster feedback and fewer fragile tests.

This combined feature set supports modern development practices such as test-driven development, continuous integration, and mocking out slow or unreliable dependencies.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use `ON_CALL` to define default mock behaviors and only add `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you want to verify explicitly.
- Favor matchers like `_` to avoid brittle tests overly reliant on argument values.
- Group ordered expectations inside `InSequence` blocks to specify strict call order only where it matters.
- Delegate calls within mocks to real or fake implementations when complex behaviors should be preserved.
- Use parameterized tests to keep your tests DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to add `MOCK_METHOD` for all virtual methods can result in unexpected calls invoking real code.
- Setting expectations after calls are made leads to undefined behavior. Each `EXPECT_CALL` must precede calls to the mock.
- Overly strict expectations on call counts or argument values can make tests fragile to unrelated changes.
