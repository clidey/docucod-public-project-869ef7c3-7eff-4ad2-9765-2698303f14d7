# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding GoogleTestâ€™s core terminology and concepts is essential to writing effective, maintainable tests and fully leveraging the framework's power. This page defines and explains fundamental building blocks such as assertions, test suites, test fixtures, parameterized and type-parameterized tests, matchers, and death tests. Establishing a shared vocabulary ensures that users can confidently interpret documentation, sample code, and feature guides that follow.

## Fundamental Terminology

### Assertions
Assertions are the heart of any test in GoogleTest. They are statements that check if certain conditions hold true.

- **Definition:** Assertions are macros that evaluate expressions and determine if a test passes or fails based on those evaluations.
- **Outcomes:** Assertions can yield *success*, *nonfatal failure* (test continues), or *fatal failure* (current function aborts).
- **User Benefit:** Clear assertions provide precise points of failure with informative diagnostics, aiding quick debugging.

### Tests
A test is a single unit of verification that exercises some aspect of your code.

- **Composition:** Contains multiple assertions that verify program behavior.
- **Result:** Passes if all assertions succeed, fails if any assertion fails or the test crashes.
- **Execution:** Tests are defined as functions and run automatically by the framework.

### Test Suites
Tests are organized into test suites which group related tests for structured, manageable testing.

- **Definition:** A test suite encapsulates one or many tests.
- **Purpose:** Enables sharing of setup and common logic among tests.
- **Terminology Note:** The term "Test Suite" replaces the older term "Test Case" for clarity and standard alignment.

### Test Fixtures
Test fixtures allow you to define common objects and subroutines shared across tests in a suite.

- **Definition:** A fixture is a class deriving from `testing::Test` that organizes shared data and setup/tear-down routines.
- **Usage:** Tests within a fixture access shared resources and benefit from consistent setup.
- **Lifecycle:** GoogleTest creates a fresh fixture object for each test, ensuring test independence.

## Parameterized Tests
GoogleTest supports versatile testing patterns by allowing tests to run multiple times with different input data or types.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

- **Definition:** Run the same test logic across multiple values provided via parameter generators.
- **Implementation:** Define a test fixture class deriving from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, then write tests with `TEST_P` macros.
- **Use Cases:** Test different inputs, command-line flags, or implementations supplied as parameters.
- **Instantiation:** Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to define parameter values for test runs.

### Typed Tests

- **Definition:** Run the same test logic on a list of types determined at compile-time.
- **Implementation:** Create a fixture template class and associate it with a list of types using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.
- **Test Body:** Use `TYPED_TEST` macros where `TypeParam` refers to the tested type.
- **Use Cases:** Verify different implementations of an interface behave correctly.

### Type-Parameterized Tests

- **Definition:** Similar to typed tests but allow the type list to be supplied and instantiated later.
- **Implementation:** Declare test patterns with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P`, register them, then instantiate with one or more type lists using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- **Use Cases:** Designed for interface verification across multiple implementations, enabling reuse of tests without repartitioning.

## Matchers

Matchers extend assertion capabilities by allowing expressive verification of complex states.

- **Definition:** Matchers are composable conditions (such as equality, substring, regular expressions) used with the `EXPECT_THAT` macro.
- **Benefit:** Provide human-readable test expectations and informative failure messages.
- **Examples:** Checking if a string contains a substring, matches a regex pattern, or if values satisfy numeric ranges.

## Death Tests

Death tests verify that code terminates (dies) as expected in specific scenarios.

- **Definition:** Tests that confirm a program aborts or terminates with a non-zero exit code, often triggered by failed assertions or critical failure conditions.
- **Common Macros:** `EXPECT_DEATH`, `ASSERT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_EXIT`, `ASSERT_EXIT`, used to specify the code expected to die and expected error message patterns.
- **Function:** Ensure preconditions/assertions cause program termination as designed, preventing silent errors.
- **Caveat:** Death tests run the code in subprocesses to avoid crashing the test runner.

## Shared Concepts and Workflow

Users write tests organized into suites. When tests share setup or objects, fixtures keep the code clean and reusable. Assertions verify expectations inside tests. Parameterized tests unlock powerful patterns to test multiple inputs or type variants without duplication. Matchers enrich assertion expressiveness. Death tests provide a way to assert that severe failures cause program exit as intended.

### Best Practices

- Use **assertions** that provide clear diagnostic messages for specific conditions.
- Group related tests into **test suites** reflecting code structure.
- Use **test fixtures** for shared setup and teardown, ensuring test isolation.
- Utilize **parameterized tests** to cover multiple scenarios concisely.
- Apply **matchers** for powerful, readable expectations.
- Employ **death tests** carefully to validate program termination behavior.

## Example Snippets

### Basic Assertion
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

### Test Fixture Usage
```cpp
class QueueTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> q_;
  void SetUp() override {
    q_.Enqueue(1);
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Value-Parameterized Test
```cpp
class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyGroup,
                         MyParamTest,
                         testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```

### Typed Test
```cpp
template <typename T>
class FooTest : public testing::Test {};

typedef testing::Types<int, double> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(FooTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(FooTest, IsZeroInitialized) {
  TypeParam value = TypeParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(value, 0);
}
```

### Death Test
```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, ExitsOnError) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({
    Foo(5);
  }, "Error.*");
}
```
