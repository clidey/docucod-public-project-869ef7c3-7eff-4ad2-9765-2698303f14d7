# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Introduction

Understanding the core concepts and terminology of GoogleTest and GoogleMock is essential to mastering effective C++ testing. This page defines key terms including assertions, test fixtures, test cases, test discovery, death tests, parameterized tests, matchers, and mocking. It clarifies how GoogleTest works alongside GoogleMock to enable precise, expressive, and maintainable tests.

By grasping these fundamentals, users can confidently design, implement, and debug tests that verify both code correctness and interaction behaviors.

## Essential Terms and Their Roles

### Assertions
Assertions are the fundamental checks in tests verifying conditions. They can signal success, nonfatal failure (test continues), or fatal failure (test aborts). Assertions like `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*` form the backbone of test validation, helping you validate outputs, states, and behaviors.

### Test Fixtures
Test fixtures allow grouping multiple related tests that share common setup and teardown code. They enable reuse of test data and logic across tests, promoting organized and consistent testing.

### Test Cases and Test Suites
GoogleTest groups related tests into test suites (historically called test cases). A test suite contains one or more tests verifying related functionality, following a logical structure that mirrors the codebase.

### Test Discovery
GoogleTest automatically discovers and registers all tests at runtime via macros like `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`. This eliminates manual test enumeration and enables seamless test execution.

### Death Tests
Specialized tests designed to verify code that should terminate abnormally, such as via assertions or crashes, ensuring that critical error conditions behave as expected.

### Parameterized Tests
Tests that run the same test logic across different input parameters, reducing duplication and increasing test coverage.

### Matchers
Matchers are predicates used in GoogleMock to specify constraints on expected function arguments. They provide flexible, readable means to validate arguments passed to mock methods.

### Mocking
Mocking is the technique of creating test doubles that simulate real objects' interfaces and behaviors. GoogleMock provides macros such as `MOCK_METHOD` to define mock classes quickly, and mechanisms like `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to specify expected interactions and behaviors.

## Relationship Between GoogleTest and GoogleMock

GoogleTest provides the foundational framework for writing and running C++ tests. GoogleMock extends GoogleTest with powerful mocking capabilities, enabling verification of interactions with dependencies.

Together, they provide a comprehensive environment where:

- GoogleTest handles test lifecycle, assertions, and test organization.
- GoogleMock helps create mock objects with expectations and behavior customization.

This synergy promotes more effective unit and integration testing strategies.

## How Key Features Work Together

### Assertions and Expectations
- Assertions verify state and outputs within tests.
- Expectations define how mock objects are expected to be called.

### Test Fixtures and Mocks
- Test fixtures can instantiate and configure mock objects shared by multiple tests.
- `ON_CALL` can set default mock behaviors in fixture setup.
- `EXPECT_CALL` sets precise expectations checked during tests.

### Matchers and Mock Calls
- Matchers specify argument validation for mock method calls.
- They enhance tests' expressiveness and resilience by focusing on relevant argument properties.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests
- Allow running suites of tests and mock configurations with varied data sets, enhancing coverage.

### Death Tests
- Use mocks and assertions to ensure proper program termination behaviors are tested rigorously.

## Practical Scenarios Illustrating Core Concepts

### Writing a Simple Assertion

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```
Checks a direct condition on the code output.

### Using a Test Fixture with a Mock

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  // ... other MOCK_METHODS ...
};

class PainterTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  MockTurtle mock_turtle;

  void SetUp() override {
    // Set default mock behavior here if any
  }
};

TEST_F(PainterTest, CallsPenDown) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  Painter painter(&mock_turtle);
  painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10);
}
```
Shows use of a mock inside a test fixture and setting expectations.

### Using Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, GoTo(50, _)); // Expects x=50, y=anything
```
Matchers like `_` enable flexible argument matching.

### Parameterized Test Example

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectFactorial) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(Factorial(n), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Values, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(1,2,3));
```
Runs the same test logic with multiple inputs.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to verify *expected* calls; use `ON_CALL` to set default mock behavior without expectation.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations to reduce brittleness.
- Group related tests with test fixtures to share setup and mock configurations.
- Use matchers for flexibility and clarity when validating mock arguments.
- Leverage parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently.
- When testing fatal behavior, use death tests to validate proper program termination.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls
- **Uninteresting calls:** Mock methods called without an `EXPECT_CALL` set; produce warnings but not failures by default.
- **Unexpected calls:** Calls that do not match any active expectation; cause test failures.

Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, and `StrictMock` to treat uninteresting calls as failures.

### Mocking Non-Virtual Methods
- Possible using unrelated classes that match method signatures.
- Allows compile-time switching of behavior using templates.

### Dealing with Overloaded Methods
- Explicitly mock all overloads or bring base methods into scope using `using` declarations to avoid hiding.

### Default Return Values
- GoogleMock provides default return values for built-in and default-constructible types.
- Customize defaults using `DefaultValue<T>::Set()` cautiously.
