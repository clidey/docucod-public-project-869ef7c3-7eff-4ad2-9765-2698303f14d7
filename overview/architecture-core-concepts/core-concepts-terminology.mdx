# Core Concepts & Terminology

Mastering GoogleTest starts with understanding its foundational vocabulary. This page demystifies essential terms and constructs, empowering you to navigate documentation, write effective tests, and leverage GoogleMock's powerful mocking capabilities with confidence.

---

## What You Will Learn

- **Assertions** — How GoogleTest verifies expected conditions in your tests.
- **Test Fixtures & Test Suites** — Organizing tests for shared context and logical grouping.
- **Parameterized Tests** — Running the same test logic with varying inputs.
- **Mock Objects** — Simulating complex dependencies with control over interactions.
- **Cardinalities** — Specifying how many times you expect mock methods to be called.

Each term is explained with concrete examples and practical tips, helping you use GoogleTest productively from day one.

## Assertions

An *assertion* checks for a condition in your test and reports failure if it doesn't hold. Assertions are your primary tool for validating expected behavior.

**Common Assertions:**
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Verifies `val1 == val2` but continues test if false.
- `ASSERT_TRUE(cond)` — Fails and aborts the current test if `cond` is false.

### Why Assertions Matter
They pinpoint where and why a test fails, making debugging faster and tests more meaningful.

### Example
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

Here, `EXPECT_EQ` checks that factorial of zero equals 1.

---

## Test Fixtures and Test Suites

Tests often need to share setup and teardown code. GoogleTest offers *Test Fixtures* to create a reusable context.

- **Test Fixture** is a C++ class deriving from `::testing::Test`.
- **Test Suite** is a collection of tests sharing a Test Fixture.

### Defining a Test Fixture
```cpp
class StackTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Runs before each test
    stack_.push(1);
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Runs after each test
    while (!stack_.empty()) stack_.pop();
  }

  std::stack<int> stack_;
};
```

### Using the Fixture
```cpp
TEST_F(StackTest, PopRemovesTopElement) {
  EXPECT_EQ(stack_.top(), 1);
  stack_.pop();
  EXPECT_TRUE(stack_.empty());
}
```

`TEST_F` links the test to the fixture class.

---

## Parameterized Tests

When testing behavior over multiple inputs, parameterized tests reduce duplication.

- Run the same test logic with different parameters.
- Inputs can be values, types, or structures.

### Example
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectly) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), factorial_reference(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ValidInputs,
                        FactorialTest,
                        ::testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
```

This runs `ComputesCorrectly` with each specified integer.

---

## Mock Objects

Mock objects stand in for real dependencies, allowing you to:

- Specify which methods you expect to be called
- Define behaviors and return values dynamically
- Control the number, order, and arguments of method calls

This replaces complex or unavailable real dependencies in tests with predictable, verifiable stand-ins.

### Creating a Mock
Define a mock class inheriting from the interface, using `MOCK_METHOD` to declare mocked methods.

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};
```

### Controlling Strictness
- **NiceMock<T>**: suppresses warnings about unexpected calls (for less noisy tests).
- **NaggyMock<T>**: warns on unexpected calls (default behavior).
- **StrictMock<T>**: fails the test on unexpected calls (for tight control).

Example:
```cpp
using ::testing::StrictMock;
StrictMock<MockTurtle> turtle;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
```

---

## Cardinalities

Cardinalities define how many times you expect a mock method to be called.

### Common Cardinalities
- `Times(1)` or omission: exactly once
- `Times(AnyNumber())`: zero or more times
- `Times(AtLeast(n))`: at least n times
- `Times(AtMost(n))`: at most n times
- `Times(Between(m, n))`: between m and n times inclusive
- `Times(Exactly(n))`: exactly n times

### Example
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, SomeMethod(_)).Times(AtLeast(2));
```

This expects `SomeMethod` to be called at least twice.

## Glossary of Other Important Terms

| Term           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Matchers**   | Expressions used inside expectations to specify flexible argument constraints, e.g., `Ge(5)`, `_` (wildcard).
| **Sequences**  | Objects (`Sequence`) to enforce an order on expectations.
| **Expectations** | Defined using `EXPECT_CALL`, specifying method invocation constraints and behavior.
| **Actions**    | Define custom behaviors for mock method calls, e.g., `Return()`, `Invoke()`.
| **ON_CALL**    | Defines default behavior of mock methods without setting expectations.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use **Test Fixtures** to share setup code and avoid duplication.
- Prefer **Parameterized Tests** to test multiple inputs efficiently.
- When using **Mocks**, start with **NiceMock** to reduce test noise, switch to **StrictMock** if you want to detect unexpected calls strictly.
- Write **Expectations** (`EXPECT_CALL`) only on methods you intend to verify.
- Use **Matchers** to specify argument constraints precisely but avoid over-specifying.
- Control call order with **Sequences** or `.InSequence()`.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations that should deactivate after reaching their call limit.

---

## Troubleshooting Authentication of Concepts

- If your mock methods don't behave as expected, ensure methods are `virtual`.
- Beware of incorrect cardinalities causing excessive or missing call failures.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock call matching and debug unexpected behaviors.
