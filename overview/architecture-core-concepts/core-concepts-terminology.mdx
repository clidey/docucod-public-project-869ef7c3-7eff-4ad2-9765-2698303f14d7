# Core Concepts & Key Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide that unlocks the essential language of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page demystifies the key terms you'll encounter as you write, understand, and maintain C++ tests built with these frameworks. By mastering this terminology, you lay the groundwork for writing expressive, reliable, and well-structured tests.

## Understanding the Language of C++ Testing with GoogleTest & GoogleMock

GoogleTest and GoogleMock introduce a rich vocabulary that encapsulates the testing workflow. Let’s explore these terms in the context of how they empower you to craft effective tests.

### xUnit

The term **xUnit** refers to a family of unit testing frameworks sharing a common architecture. GoogleTest is a C++ variant, providing the infrastructure for defining tests as _test cases_ with _test fixtures_, and organizing test execution and reporting.

- **Value to you**: Embracing xUnit’s structured approach ensures your tests are modular, maintainable, and easy to scale.

### Assertions

**Assertions** verify conditions during test execution. In GoogleTest, macros like `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE` check values and states:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(expected_value, actual_value); // Non-fatal failure
ASSERT_TRUE(condition);                 // Fatal failure
```

- **User impact**: These guardrails help detect bugs early, providing immediate feedback about the correctness of code blocks within tests.

### Matchers

Matched to GoogleMock, **Matchers** are predicates that flexibly specify expected argument values when mocking methods:

- Simple matcher: `_` (wildcard, match anything)
- More specific: `Gt(5)` (greater than 5), `Eq("hello")` (equal to "hello")

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething(Gt(10))); // Argument must be > 10
```

- **Why you care**: Matchers allow precise control over which calls satisfy your expectations, reducing brittle or overly broad tests.

### Mocks

**Mocks** are objects that simulate real class behaviors, letting you specify:

- Which methods are called,
- How many times they are called,
- What arguments they receive,
- What outputs or side effects they generate.

You define mocks with `MOCK_METHOD` macros inside mock classes.

- **Benefit**: By using mocks, you isolate tested components from dependencies, ensuring tests are focused and problems easier to diagnose.

### Actions

**Actions** dictate _what happens_ when a mock method is called. Built-in actions include:

- `Return(value)`: Return a value,
- `Invoke(function)`: Execute a provided function or lambda,
- `SetArgPointee<N>(value)`: Modify an output argument at position N.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(Return(42));
```

- **User impact**: Actions let your mocks behave like real objects or simulate special behavior needed to test edge cases.

### Expectations

**Expectations** specify _expected interactions_ with mocks, set using `EXPECT_CALL()`. They convey:

- Expected method calls with argument constraints,
- How many times (cardinality) those calls must happen,
- The order and sequencing of calls,
- The actions performed when calls occur.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Save(_)).Times(2).WillRepeatedly(Return(true));
```

- **Why it matters**: Expectations verify not just results but the interaction patterns of your system, capturing subtle logic bugs.

### Test Fixtures

**Test fixtures** provide a shared setup environment for related tests, enabling reuse of initialization code and common resources.

- In GoogleTest, fixtures are classes deriving from `testing::Test`.

Example:

```cpp
class MyTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // common initialization
  }
};

TEST_F(MyTest, Test1) {
  // Test code here
}
```

- **User benefit**: Fixtures reduce duplication, making your tests easier to write and maintain.

### Cardinalities

**Cardinalities** define _how many times_ you expect a mock method to be called. They use the `.Times()` clause in `EXPECT_CALL`:

| Cardinality            | Meaning                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `AnyNumber()`          | Method can be called any times   |
| `AtLeast(n)`           | Called at least n times          |
| `AtMost(n)`            | Called at most n times           |
| `Between(m, n)`        | Called between m and n times     |
| `Exactly(n)` or `n`    | Called exactly n times           |

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Update()).Times(Exactly(3));
```

- **Why it’s useful**: You avoid overly loose or overly strict tests by controlling invocation counts precisely.

### Death Tests

Death tests verify that certain code paths cause the program to terminate (e.g., due to fatal assertions).

- GoogleTest supports death tests directly via macros like `EXPECT_DEATH`.

- **Test utility**: Useful for validating defensive code and error handling.

## How These Concepts Work Together: A Practical Workflow

1. **Define mocks** to simulate dependencies with `MOCK_METHOD`.
2. **Set expectations** on mock methods, specifying expected calls, cardinalities, and actions.
3. Optionally, **configure default behavior** with `ON_CALL`.
4. **Run your tests** which exercise production code interacting with mocks.
5. **Assertions** validate state and output.
6. On completion, GoogleMock automatically **checks that expectations were met**.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Use `ON_CALL` for setting default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` when you want to verify that a call happens.
- Be explicit about cardinalities to avoid brittle tests.
- Use matchers to focus on relevant argument properties, not exact values, where appropriate.
- Use test fixtures to share setup and teardown logic.
- Choose between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` based on how strictly you want to treat unexpected calls.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Uninteresting Calls Warning**: Indicates a method without expectations was called. Suppress it with `NiceMock`, or add an `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` if intentional.
- **Unexpected Calls Error**: A method call has no matching expectation. Review your `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- **Cardinality Violations**: Ensure `.Times()` matches your usage pattern; use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations inactive after they’re saturated.
- **Setup After Exercise**: All expectations must be set before the code under test runs.
