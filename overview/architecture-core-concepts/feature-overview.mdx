# Core Features at a Glance

GoogleTest and GoogleMock come packed with a comprehensive set of features designed to streamline your C++ testing and mocking workflows. This page provides a focused snapshot of their most impactful capabilities, highlighting how they enable high productivity, flexible test designs, and rigorous verification.

## Automatic Test Discovery
- Discover tests **automatically** without manual registration.
- Supports test fixtures and parameterized tests.
- Eliminates boilerplate setup, allowing you to focus on writing tests.

## Flexible Assertions
- Rich **assertion macros** for expressing expected results.
- Support for basic conditions, floating-point comparisons, exception checks, and more.
- Enables clear, readable validation statements aligned with test intent.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests
- Define tests parametrized by values or types.
- Write a single test template that runs multiple times for different inputs or types.
- Promotes reusability and coverage without duplicating test code.

## Mock Objects and Interaction Verification
- Define mock classes using simple macros that auto-generate mock methods.
- Set expectations on method calls: argument matching, call order, call count, and return behaviors.
- Supports sophisticated ordering with sequences and partial orders.
- Rich set of built-in matchers and customizable matchers to specify argument expectations precisely.
- Control mock object behavior with actions like returning values, invoking callbacks, or chaining side-effects.

## Running and Reporting Options
- Command-line flags to filter and run subsets of tests.
- Detailed failure reports including call stacks and argument values.
- Configurable verbosity to assist debugging or suppress noise.

## Why These Features Matter
These features collectively deliver a testing environment that:

- Makes test writing concise yet expressive.
- Ensures correctness by verifying not just outcomes but also interactions.
- Facilitates maintenance by supporting parameterization and reusable mocks.
- Provides diagnostics and tooling to simplify debugging.

## How This Fits Into Your Workflow
Start by writing tests with automatic discovery and assertions to validate functionality. When your tests require validating complex interactions or dependencies, create mock objects with clear expectations. Use parameterization to avoid duplication and scale your test coverage efficiently. Control test execution and reporting for your development or CI pipelines.

## Practical Tips
- Begin with simple assertions and only add mocks when needed to verify interaction.
- Use sequences and `InSequence` to enforce call order when necessary.
- Prefer `NiceMock` to suppress harmless warnings during test development.

### Example: Combining Assertions, Parameterization, and Mocks
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::InSequence;

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetUserCount, (), (const));
};

TEST(DatabaseTest, ConnectionWorks) {
  MockDatabase db;

  EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect())
      .WillOnce(Return(true));

  EXPECT_CALL(db, GetUserCount())
      .WillOnce(Return(42));

  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Connect());
  EXPECT_EQ(42, db.GetUserCount());
}

TEST(DatabaseTest, MultipleCallsInSequence) {
  MockDatabase db;
  {
    InSequence seq;
    EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect()).WillOnce(Return(true));
    EXPECT_CALL(db, GetUserCount()).WillOnce(Return(0));
  }

  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Connect());
  EXPECT_EQ(0, db.GetUserCount());
}
```
