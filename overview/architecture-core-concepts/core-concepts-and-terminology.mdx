# Core Concepts and Terminology

Unlock foundational knowledge of GoogleTest by understanding its essential terms and constructs. This guide clarifies core concepts such as assertions, test cases, test fixtures, parameterized and typed tests, and mocks. It serves as your key to mastering GoogleTest’s testing framework vocabulary and differentiating it from similar systems.

## Understanding GoogleTest Nomenclature

GoogleTest terminology can be confusing, especially around *Test*, *Test Case*, and *Test Suite*. To keep it simple:

- **Test**: An individual verification of a program behavior, often called a test case in other frameworks.
- **Test Suite**: A group of related tests, formerly called a test case in older GoogleTest versions.

This page uses the current preferred terminology — *Test Suite* — consistent with modern software testing practices.

## Assertions: The Heart of Verification

Assertions in GoogleTest are the fundamental tools to express expectations about your program’s behavior. They come in two flavors:

- **`EXPECT_*` macros** (non-fatal failures): Report failure but allow the test to continue.
- **`ASSERT_*` macros** (fatal failures): Abort the current test function immediately upon failure.

Assertions help you verify conditions such as:

- Boolean truth values (`EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_FALSE`)
- Value equality or inequality (`EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, and others)
- String content (`EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`)
- Floating-point approximations (`EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`)

Use assertions to document assumptions and detect deviations early, improving confidence in your code.

### Example: Basic Assertions

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  ASSERT_GT(Factorial(5), 0);
}
```

## Test Cases and Test Suites: Organizing Your Tests

- A **Test**: A single function verifying one particular behavior. It contains assertions.
- A **Test Suite**: A collection of logically related tests sharing a name and often a purpose.

GoogleTest groups your tests by test suites to reflect your code’s logical structure. This grouping aids discoverability, reporting, and test execution.

### Writing a Simple Test

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  ... test code and assertions ...
}
```

Both `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` should be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.

---

## Test Fixtures: Reuse Configuration Across Tests

When multiple tests share common setup and teardown steps or data, use **test fixtures**. These are classes derived from `testing::Test` that provide a shared environment to tests in the same suite.

### How Test Fixtures Work

1. Define a fixture class deriving from `testing::Test`.
2. Specify `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods (optional) for initializing and cleaning up shared state.
3. Use `TEST_F()` macro to write tests that use the fixture, giving access to fixture members.

### Example: Queue Test Fixture

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each test runs with a fresh fixture object, guaranteeing independence.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests: Cover More Scenarios Efficiently

### Parameterized Tests

Use **value-parameterized tests** to run the same test logic on multiple input values without duplicating code. This is perfect for data-driven testing.

- Derive your fixture from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`.
- Use `TEST_P()` macro to write parameterized tests.
- Instantiate tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` macro.

### Typed Tests

Run the same tests across multiple types to verify interface implementations or concepts.

- Define a class template fixture derived from `testing::Test`.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` and `TYPED_TEST()` macros.
- List types with `testing::Types<...>`.

Both techniques reduce boilerplate, improve coverage, and catch edge cases.

## Mock Objects: Simulating Collaborators for Isolation and Control

Mocks replicate interfaces of real objects but let you precisely specify expected interactions.

- Define mock classes deriving from interfaces.
- Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to specify mocked methods.
- Set call expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Control behavior using actions like `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly`.

Mocking lets you:

- Isolate unit tests from dependencies.
- Verify how your code interacts with collaborators.
- Simulate failure conditions and edge cases.

### Example of Mock Class

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, CanDrawCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
}
```

## Tips for Mastery

- Prefer `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*` where possible to maximize test feedback.
- Group related tests logically with test suites.
- Reuse setup logic with test fixtures for cleaner, DRY tests.
- Parameterize tests to cover variations comprehensively.
- Use mocks wisely, focusing on necessary interactions.

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing `Test Case` with `Test Suite`: Use current terminology consistently.
- Using `ASSERT_*` macros without necessity, which can hide further failures.
- Sharing mutable fixture state across tests leading to unpredictable results.
- Over-mocking, causing brittle tests sensitive to implementation changes.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Test does not fail when expected?** Verify your assertions and ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()`.
- **Unexpected interaction failures with mocks?** Confirm expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` precede mock usage.
- **Test suite runs slowly?** Consider sharing expensive setup in `SetUpTestSuite()` instead of per-test setup.
