# Essential Concepts & Terminology

GoogleTest is a comprehensive framework for writing and organizing C++ tests. To use it effectively, understanding its core concepts and terminology is essential. This page demystifies the key vocabulary such as test suites, test fixtures, assertions, death tests, mock objects, and parameterized tests, which are foundational for mastering GoogleTest.

---

## Test Cases, Test Suites, and Test Programs

- **Test**: An individual test verifies a specific behavior or feature of the code. It consists of a set of statements and assertions that validate expected outcomes.

- **Test Suite**: A collection of related tests that share a common context or concern. Organizing tests into suites helps group functionality logically and allows for shared setup or teardown actions.

- **Test Program**: The executable containing multiple test suites and tests that GoogleTest runs.

GoogleTest recently standardized on the term **Test Suite** in place of the older **Test Case** terminology to align with broader testing conventions like ISTQB.

### Key Macro Types for Defining Tests

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` – Defines a simple test without a fixture.
- `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)` – Defines a test that uses a test fixture.
- `TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)` – Defines a value-parameterized test using a fixture.

Each test has a unique **full name**, composed of its test suite's name and the individual test name.

---

## Test Fixtures

Test fixtures allow sharing common setup and cleanup code for multiple tests within the same test suite.

### Creating a Fixture

1. Define a **fixture class** by inheriting from `testing::Test`.
2. Declare shared data members and override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` if initialization or cleanup is needed.
3. Use `TEST_F()` to write tests that use this fixture.

This enables tests to run with a consistent base state, avoiding duplication.

Example:

```cpp
class MyQueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue.Enqueue(42);
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup if required
  }

  Queue<int> queue;
};

TEST_F(MyQueueTest, StartsWithOneItem) {
  EXPECT_EQ(queue.size(), 1);
}

TEST_F(MyQueueTest, DequeueReturnsItem) {
  auto item = queue.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(item, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*item, 42);
}
```

Note: GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance for each test to ensure isolation.

---

## Assertions

Assertions are the heart of testing in GoogleTest. They evaluate conditions and determine if a test passes or fails.

- `ASSERT_*`: Generates **fatal failures** and aborts the current test function immediately if the assertion fails.
- `EXPECT_*`: Generates **nonfatal failures**, allowing the test to continue running after failure.

Use `ASSERT_*` when continuing would be meaningless or unsafe (e.g., dereferencing a null pointer), and `EXPECT_*` when you want to collect multiple failures in a test.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  ASSERT_NE(Factorial(3), 0) << "Factorial should not be zero!";
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

### Custom Failure Messages

Stream additional context into assertions using `<<`:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors have different sizes";
```

---

## Value-Parameterized Tests

Value-parameterized tests let you run the same test logic across multiple values without repeating code.

### How to Define

1. Define a test fixture inheriting from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the parameter type.
2. Use `TEST_P()` to specify test logic that depends on a parameter.
3. Instantiate the test suite using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` providing parameter values or generators.

Inside the test body, access the current parameter with `GetParam()`.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesAll) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(Valid(param));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyGroup, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

---

## Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests

These facilities help test the same logic across multiple types, suited for template code or ensuring interface conformity.

### Typed Tests

- Define a fixture class template parameterized by type.
- Associate the fixture with a list of types using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()`.
- Define tests using `TYPED_TEST()` where `TypeParam` refers to the current type.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyFixture, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyFixture, DoesSomething) {
  TypeParam val = this->value_;
  EXPECT_TRUE(SomeCheck(val));
}
```

### Type-Parameterized Tests

Similar to typed tests but allow for defining abstract test patterns and instantiating them with types later, using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P()` and `TYPED_TEST_P()`.

You must register tests with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P()` before instantiation.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {};

TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyFixture);

TYPED_TEST_P(MyFixture, DoesThing) { ... }

REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyFixture, DoesThing);

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, float>;
INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyInstance, MyFixture, MyTypes);
```

---

## Death Tests

Death tests verify that code terminates or crashes under certain conditions as expected.

- They ensure your program correctly detects invalid states or illegal operations by crashing immediately.
- GoogleTest provides macros like `ASSERT_DEATH()` and `EXPECT_DEATH()` to write these.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, CrashesOnNullPointer) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(FunctionUnderTest(nullptr), "null pointer");
}
```

**Important:** Death test suites should be named with the suffix `DeathTest` to ensure proper execution order and thread safety.

---

## Blocking vs. Non-blocking Failures

GoogleTest distinguishes between **fatal** and **nonfatal** failures:

- **Fatal failures**: Abort the current test function immediately (`ASSERT_*` macros).
- **Nonfatal failures**: Log the failure but let the test continue (`EXPECT_*` macros).

Using nonfatal failures allows tests to report multiple issues in one run.

GoogleTest also provides utilities for detecting whether failures occurred, such as `HasFatalFailure()` and `HasNonfatalFailure()`, to help control test execution.

---

## Specialized Concepts

### Mock Objects

Though primarily covered in GoogleMock, you may hear about **mock objects** in GoogleTest contexts when tests interact with simulated collaborators.

### Blocking Failures

Failures that stop test execution immediately are blocking (fatal). Use these to prevent cascading errors.

### Non-Blocking Failures

Failures where test execution continues to allow gathering more failure information.

---

## Additional Facilities

- **Assertions** can be **scoped** with `SCOPED_TRACE()` to add contextual information when failures occur deep in helper functions.
- **Friend Tests** declared with `FRIEND_TEST` allow tests to access private or protected members of classes under test.
- Use `RecordProperty(key, value)` to associate metadata with tests, which appears in XML or JSON output.
- Use the `GTEST_SKIP()` macro to skip tests dynamically during runtime based on preconditions.
