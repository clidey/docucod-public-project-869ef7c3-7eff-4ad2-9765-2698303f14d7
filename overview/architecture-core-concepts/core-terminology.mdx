# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental vocabulary of GoogleTest is essential to effectively use and navigate its rich feature set. This page introduces and defines the key terms such as test cases, test suites, assertions, matchers, mocks, death tests, and fixtures. Having a solid grasp of these concepts empowers you to write clearer tests, leverage advanced capabilities, and follow documentation with confidence.

## Why Vocabulary Matters

Before diving into the specifics of GoogleTest, it’s important to distinguish what each term means within this framework. Misunderstanding these can lead to confusion when reading the documentation or writing tests. This section sets the foundation by clarifying the common terms you will encounter.

### Test

A **Test** is a single, independent piece of code that verifies a particular behavior or functionality. It contains assertions that check expected outcomes.

> In GoogleTest, a `Test` corresponds to what many testing frameworks refer to as a *test case.*

### Test Suite

A **Test Suite** is a collection of related tests grouped logically, often corresponding to the class or module they test. Grouping tests in suites allows easier organization, shared setup/teardown, and selective execution.

### Assertion

An **Assertion** is a statement within a test that verifies whether a condition holds true. GoogleTest provides two types:

- **Fatal assertions** (e.g., `ASSERT_*`) abort the current function upon failure.
- **Nonfatal assertions** (e.g., `EXPECT_*`) continue running after failure to report multiple errors.

Proper use of assertions ensures tests signal errors accurately.

### Matcher

**Matchers** are predicates used to specify expected argument values in tests and mocks. They range from simple equality checks to complex conditions.

- Example: `_` means "match any value".
- Example: `Gt(10)` means "greater than 10".

Matchers provide expressive power to tailor the expectations.

### Mock

A **Mock** is a test double that simulates behavior of real objects. GoogleMock (gMock) lets you declaratively define mocks, specify expected calls, argument matchers, call counts, and actions. Mocks help isolate code under test and verify interactions with dependencies.

### Fixture

A **Fixture** is a test setup class that provides a shared environment and data for multiple tests in a suite. In GoogleTest, fixtures are classes derived from `testing::Test`.

### Death Test

A **Death Test** verifies that certain code triggers a fatal failure (e.g., crashes, assertions) as expected. These tests assert programs fail safely under erroneous conditions.

## Terminology Breakdown

### Test Case vs Test Suite

Historically, GoogleTest used **Test Case** to indicate what is now commonly called a **Test Suite**. The newer API prefers the term *Test Suite*, aligning with industry standards like ISTQB. Throughout modern GoogleTest documentation and usage, prefer *Test Suite*.

| Concept                                      | GoogleTest Term     | Standard Term (ISTQB)   |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Single verification of behavior               | Test               | Test Case              |
| Grouping of related tests                      | Test Suite (formerly Test Case) | Test Suite     |

### Assertions

Assertions are the building blocks of your tests, verifying expected conditions:

- `ASSERT_*` macros: Fatal failures; test stops immediately on failure.
- `EXPECT_*` macros: Nonfatal failures; test continues to collect multiple errors.

**Best Practice:** Use `EXPECT_*` for general checks and `ASSERT_*` when continuation of the test is pointless without the condition.

### Matchers

Matchers work especially well in mock expectations, enabling you to specify which arguments are acceptable:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;   // Wildcard matcher
using ::testing::Eq;  // Equality matcher
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(Eq(5), _)); // Expects first arg 5, second any
```

Matchers make tests flexible and readable.

### Mocks

Mocks simulate real objects by:

- Defining mocked methods using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Setting expectations on method calls with `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Specifying behaviors using actions like `Return()`, `WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`.

Mocks help verify interactions beyond just end results of test code.

### Fixtures

Fixtures enable code reuse for:

- Setting up shared objects (`SetUp()` method).
- Cleaning up resources (`TearDown()` method).

Tests using fixtures are declared with `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)`, enabling direct access to fixture members.

### Death Tests

Death tests ensure your program behaves correctly under fatal error conditions.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ CrashProneFunction(); }, "expected error message");
```

They validate that code fails as expected.

## Real-World Example: Understanding Test Structure

Imagine writing tests for a `Calculator` class:

- **Test Suite:** `CalculatorTest` groups all tests for the `Calculator`.
- **Fixture:** `CalculatorTest` fixture sets up a reusable `Calculator` object.
- **Test:** Individual tests like `AdditionWorks` verify specific functionality.
- **Assertions:** Inside tests to check if results match expected values.
- **Matchers:** Used if you mock a dependency that `Calculator` interacts with.

```cpp
class CalculatorTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc_;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AdditionWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calc_.Add(1, 2), 3);
}
```

Solid grasp of terminology lets you read, write, and debug tests effectively.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names for tests and test suites; avoid underscores in names.
- **Assertions Types:** Use `EXPECT_*` for most situations; prefer `ASSERT_*` when failure renders test invalid.
- **Matchers:** Use `_` for arguments you don’t care about, `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `Lt()`, and custom matchers for precise controls.
- **Mocks:** Define only methods you need to mock; keep mocks focused.
- **Fixtures:** Use fixtures when many tests share set-up / tear-down code.
- **Death Tests:** Use to verify error handling and failure conditions.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing Test Suite and Test Case terminology.
- Expecting mocks to work without expectations set first.
- Over-specifying matchers, leading to brittle tests.
- Ignoring return values of test runner functions.
- Writing tests without fixtures when multiple tests share set-up code.
