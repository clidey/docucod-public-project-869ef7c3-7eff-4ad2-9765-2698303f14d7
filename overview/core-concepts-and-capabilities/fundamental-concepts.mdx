# Fundamental Concepts

## Introduction to Core Elements of GoogleTest

Understanding the foundational elements of GoogleTest empowers you to structure and run your C++ tests effectively. This section walks you through the key building blocks — test cases, test suites, assertions, fixtures, mocks, and parameterized tests — clarifying their definitions, usage, and roles within the framework.

---

## What Are Test Suites and Tests?

GoogleTest organizes tests into *test suites* and *tests* (formerly known as *test cases* and *test* respectively). While terminology can be confusing across testing literature, here’s the user-centric clarification:

- **Test**: An individual check that verifies a specific behavior or condition within your code. It corresponds to what many testing standards call a *test case*.
- **Test Suite**: A group of related tests meant to be run together. Think of it as a container organizing tests for easier maintenance and execution.

Each test is identified by a full name combining its test suite and test name.

### Practical Example
Imagine you have a class `Factorial` and want to verify its correctness:

```cpp
// Test that factorial of 0 is 1.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

// Test factorial for positive numbers.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(8), 40320);
}
```

Here, `FactorialTest` is the test suite, containing tests like `HandlesZeroInput` and `HandlesPositiveInput`.

## Assertions: Verifying Code Behavior

At the core of every test lie *assertions*. Assertions confirm that your code behaves as expected. They come in two flavors:

- **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: If a fatal assertion fails, it aborts the current test function immediately. Use this when continuing a test is meaningless after the failure.
- **Non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: These record a failure but continue test execution, allowing multiple related assertions to be evaluated.

### Why Are Assertions Important?

Failures in assertions give you precise feedback with file and line information, facilitating quick diagnosis. You can customize failure messages for greater clarity.

### Example

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(container.size(), expected_size) << "Size mismatch in container";
for (int i = 0; i < expected_size; ++i) {
  EXPECT_EQ(container[i], expected_values[i]) << "Mismatch at index " << i;
}
```

This example ensures the container has the expected size before checking its contents, aborting early if the size check fails.

## Test Fixtures: Reusing Setup and Data

When multiple tests require similar setup or share common objects, *test fixtures* let you write that setup once and reuse it.

### How Test Fixtures Work

1. Define a fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
2. Declare member variables to hold shared test data.
3. Override `SetUp()` to initialize these members before each test runs.
4. Use `TEST_F()` instead of `TEST()` to write tests that leverage the fixture.

### Example Fixture

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Prepare multiple queues for testing.
    q0_.Clear();
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
  delete n;
}
```

This example shows multiple queue states tested efficiently with a shared fixture.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests: Scalable Testing

To cover different input values or types without repetitive code, GoogleTest offers:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test logic with various input values.
- **Typed Tests**: Run the same test logic using different data types.

Both approaches reduce code duplication and improve test coverage.

### Value-Parameterized Test Example

Define a test fixture inheriting from `TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the parameter type.

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesVariousValues) {
  int val = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(Process(val));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(ValidValues, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 4));
```

### Typed Test Example

Declare a fixture class template and associate it with a list of types:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

typedef testing::Types<int, float, double> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, TypePropertyCheck) {
  TypeParam val = this->value_;
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValidType(val));
}
```

## Mocks: Simulating Behavior

GoogleTest integrates with GoogleMock to provide mock objects. These allow you to:

- **Simulate dependencies** easily.
- **Control and observe interactions** between components.

Mocks help to isolate units under test and validate their collaboration with other parts of the system.

While mocks are covered in detail elsewhere, it's crucial to understand that they eliminate the need to rely on real implementations when testing.

## Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept                 | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Test                    | Individual verification of a code behavior, defined by `TEST()` macro.                          |
| Test Suite              | Collection of related tests, logically grouping tests for organization and shareable setup.     |
| Assertion               | Statement verifying conditions; `ASSERT_*` aborts on failure, `EXPECT_*` continues on failure.  |
| Test Fixture            | Reusable setup and teardown code for multiple tests within a test suite.                          |
| Parameterized Tests     | Tests designed to run multiple times with different input values or types.                      |
| Mocks                   | Fake objects mimicking behavior of real objects to isolate test subjects.                       |

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions to allow multiple verifications per test, unless test invalidation justifies aborting.
- Use test fixtures to reduce duplication and enhance test clarity.
- Name test suites and tests clearly, using PascalCase without underscores.
- When parameterizing tests, choose descriptive names for better result readability.
- Leverage GoogleMock for isolating components but keep mocks simple to avoid brittle tests.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Confusion About Terminology**: Remember that GoogleTest prefers `Test Suite` over `Test Case` and `Test` over `Test Case` to align with broader testing literature.
- **Misuse of Assertions**: Mixing `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*` incorrectly can lead to confusing failures—use `ASSERT_*` only when continuation makes no sense.
- **Fixture Setup Not Called**: Ensure `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods are spelled correctly (capital `U` in `SetUp`).
- **Incorrect Macro Usage**: Use `TEST_F()` instead of `TEST()` when tests use fixtures.
