# Core Features at a Glance

Explore the essential strengths of GoogleTest, Google’s robust and flexible C++ testing framework. This guide offers a succinct walkthrough of GoogleTest’s major capabilities—from foundational xUnit architecture and comprehensive assertion utilities to advanced parameterized testing and fine-grained control over test execution.

## 1. Intuitive xUnit-based Test Framework

GoogleTest embraces the familiar xUnit architecture, making it easy for developers to define and organize tests intuitively.

- **Test Case and Test Definition**: Write tests using the `TEST()` macro with a clear naming convention.
- **Test Fixtures**: Group related tests with shared setup/teardown logic via fixture classes derived from `::testing::Test`.
- **Automatic Test Registration**: Tests register themselves automatically; no manual discovery needed.

### Example: Simple Test
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, SimpleAddition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

## 2. Rich Set of Assertions

GoogleTest provides various assertion macros to check conditions and verify code behavior precisely.

- **Fatal vs Non-Fatal Assertions**: Use `ASSERT_*` to abort the current test on failure, and `EXPECT_*` to continue.
- **Wide Library of Checks**: Equality, inequality, boolean checks, null-pointer checks, string matches, exceptions, and more.
- **Custom Assertions**: Define your own assertions with expressive messages.

### Example: Common Assertions
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(13));
ASSERT_NE(pointer, nullptr);
EXPECT_THROW(SomeFunction(), std::runtime_error);
```

## 3. Advanced Parameterized and Typed Tests

Reusable tests for multiple input values make your test suite more robust and compact.

- **Parameterized Tests**: Write a test once, run it against many values using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- **Typed Tests**: Run the same test logic on different types, useful for templates.
- Combine parameterized and typed tests for maximum flexibility.

### Example: Parameterized Test
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, HandlesEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

## 4. Flexible Test Execution and Filtering

GoogleTest’s powerful command-line flags allow you to customize how tests run.

- Run specific test cases or individual tests via patterns.
- Control test shuffle, repeat, randomization, and output format.
- Integration with popular IDEs and build systems.

### Example: Run tests matching a pattern
```shell
test_binary --gtest_filter=MathTest.*
```

## 5. Detailed and Helpful Failure Reports

When assertions fail, GoogleTest provides actionable feedback:

- Shows values of expected vs actual.
- Displays file and line number where failure occurred.
- Offers stack trace when enabled.
- Gives precise cause for failure for easier debugging.

With these detailed messages, diagnosing test failures becomes straightforward and efficient.

## 6. Seamless Integration With GoogleMock

GoogleTest is designed to integrate naturally with GoogleMock, supporting robust mocking capabilities:

- Define mock classes easily with `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Set expectations on method calls, argument matchers, call counts, and sequencing.
- Specify default behaviors and actions.

Refer to the [Mock Class Definition & Method Mocking](/api-reference/mocking-apis/mock-class-definition) and [Expectations & Behaviors](/api-reference/mocking-apis/expectations-behaviors) for detailed guidance.

## Why GoogleTest Stands Out

- **Simplicity and Familiarity**: Authors tests with simple macros and concepts familiar to developers.
- **Comprehensive**: Covers a wide variety of assertion types and test scenarios.
- **Advanced Features**: Parameterized and typed tests let you avoid duplication.
- **Robust Diagnostics**: Clear failure messages enhance developer productivity.
- **Configurable Test Execution**: Easily run, filter, and manage tests.
- **Extensible**: Integrates tightly with GoogleMock and supports custom extensions.
