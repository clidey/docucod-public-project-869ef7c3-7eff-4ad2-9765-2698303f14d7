# Core Concepts and Terminology

## Introduction: Building Your Testing Vocabulary

To confidently navigate GoogleTest’s extensive capabilities and write effective test code, it’s essential to understand the foundational terms and concepts that underlie the framework. This page defines key terminology such as assertions, fixtures, test cases, death tests, parameterized tests, and mocks, explaining their roles and how they empower you to build robust tests.

### Why Learn These Terms?

Imagine trying to assemble a complex puzzle without knowledge of the individual pieces. Similarly, without grasping these basic terms, you may find it challenging to fully leverage GoogleTest’s power or to understand subsequent documentation. This section lays the groundwork so you can move forward with clarity and purpose.

## Fundamental Terms Explained

### Assertions

**What they are:** Assertions are statements in your tests that verify expected conditions about your code. They form the heart of your validation logic.

**Role:** They determine whether a test passes or fails based on certain conditions, such as equality of values or truth of expressions.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value);  // Checks if "result" equals "expected_value"
```

**Key points:**
- Assertions can signal successes, nonfatal failures (test continues), or fatal failures (test aborts).
- GoogleTest treats `ASSERT_*` macros as fatal (aborting the current test function) and `EXPECT_*` macros as nonfatal.

---

### Fixtures (Test Fixtures)

**What they are:** A fixture is a class that groups multiple related tests sharing common setup and teardown logic or data.

**Role:** Fixtures help maintain clean and reusable test code by avoiding duplication and consolidating test data and initialization.

**Example:**
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare common test environment
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up after tests
  }
  Foo my_foo_instance;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(my_foo_instance.IsValid(5));
}
```

**Key points:**
- `TEST_F` macro is used together with fixtures.
- Each test creates a fresh fixture instance for isolation.

---

### Test Cases and Test Suites

**What they are:** In GoogleTest, a *Test Suite* is a collection of related tests grouped under a common name.

**Role:** Test suites provide logical organization mirroring tested components or features.

**Note:** The framework is transitioning from the older term "Test Case" to "Test Suite" to align with widely accepted industry terms.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) { ... }
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) { ... }
```
Here, `FactorialTest` is the test suite containing multiple tests.

---

### Test Cases and Tests Explained

- **Test:** An individual function verifying some behavior or property.
- **Test Suite:** The grouping of related tests, often representing a class, module, or feature.

---

### Death Tests

**What they are:** Special tests that verify your program terminates correctly under specific conditions.

**Role:** They help ensure that your program responds to fatal errors or asserts as expected by actually causing termination.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, CrashesOnInvalidInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({ MyFunc(nullptr); }, "null pointer");
}
```

**Key points:**
- Run in separate processes because they cause termination.
- Useful for testing assertion failures and abort conditions.

---

### Parameterized Tests

**What they are:** Tests executed multiple times with different parameters.

**Role:** They enable data-driven testing, reducing duplication and improving coverage.

**Example:**
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, IsEven) {
  int value = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(value % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, FooTest,
    testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

**Key points:**
- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` macros.
- Access parameters through `GetParam()`.

---

### Mocks and Mock Objects

**What they are:** Special objects used in tests to simulate behavior of real components.

**Role:** Mocks allow you to isolate code under test from external dependencies, set expectations on interactions, and verify them.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoSomething, (), ());
};

TEST(MockTest, CallsDoSomething) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething()).Times(1);
  ... code under test ...
}
```

**Key points:**
- Defined using `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Expectations set using `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Part of GoogleMock, integrated with GoogleTest.

## How These Concepts Work Together

The typical workflow in GoogleTest involves:

1. Writing **assertions** to specify expected test outcomes.
2. Grouping related tests using **test suites**.
3. Reusing setup code via **fixtures**.
4. Testing behaviors with various data using **parameterized tests**.
5. Verifying system interactions by creating **mocks**.
6. Validating error handling and process termination with **death tests**.

Understanding these terms prepares you to explore more detailed examples and leverage the framework's power effectively.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Favor descriptive test suite and test names to reflect the code under test.
- Use fixtures to avoid repetition and improve test isolation.
- Apply parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios succinctly.
- Name death test suites with `*DeathTest` suffix for clarity.
- Use mocks to isolate tests and ensure proper interaction verifying.

## Troubleshooting Common Terminology Confusions

- **Test Case vs. Test Suite:** GoogleTest is standardizing on *Test Suite*, which aligns with ISTQB and common testing parlance.
- **Fixture vs. Test Suite:** A *fixture* is a class used within a test suite to provide shared set-up.
- **Death Test vs. Normal Test:** Death tests run code expected to terminate the process and require special handling.
