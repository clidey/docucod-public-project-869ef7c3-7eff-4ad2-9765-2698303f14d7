# Who Uses GoogleTest?

GoogleTest stands as the cornerstone for C++ testing across numerous high-profile and critical codebases. Its robustness, versatility, and maturity have earned the trust of both open-source and large-scale enterprise projects globally.

## Trusted by Leading Projects

- **Google**: Naturally, many internal Google projects rely on GoogleTest due to its deep alignment with Google's development culture and rigorous quality standards.

- **Chromium Project**: The backbone of the popular Google Chrome browser and Chrome OS, Chromium extensively uses GoogleTest to ensure reliability and performance.

- **LLVM Compiler Infrastructure**: As one of the most widely adopted compiler frameworks, LLVM incorporates GoogleTest to verify its components and maintain correctness.

- **Protocol Buffers**: Google's data interchange format leverages GoogleTest to maintain the integrity of its serialization/deserialization logic.

- **OpenCV**: The renowned computer vision library uses GoogleTest to enforce stability and correctness across its vast image processing code.

## Why These Users Choose GoogleTest

*These projects require a testing framework that is:* 

- **Reliable and Reproducible**: GoogleTest creates isolated, repeatable tests, preventing flakiness.
- **Feature-Rich**: From automated test discovery to rich assertion types and death tests, GoogleTest covers diverse testing scenarios.
- **Highly Maintainable**: Its organizational model fits complex codebases with test fixtures, typed tests, and parameterized tests.
- **Easily Integrated**: Compatible with major build systems, continuous integration environments, and multiple platforms.

## Real-World Impact

Imagine working within Chromium to deliver features to millions of users. GoogleTest enables the developers to:

- Write well-structured test suites that mirror complex browser components.
- Identify regressions rapidly via detailed failure reports.
- Extend tests with mocks and parameterizations to cover diverse cases.

Similarly, the maintainers of LLVM save countless hours by running comprehensive automated tests that scale across architectures and compilers, thanks to GoogleTest's support for typed and value-parameterized tests.

## Summary

GoogleTest powers critical, high-impact software by providing a dependable and flexible testing foundation. Whether you are working on a small component or a vast system, GoogleTest's proven track record underscores its value.
