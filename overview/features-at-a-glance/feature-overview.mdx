# GoogleTest Features at a Glance

## Unlocking Powerful and Flexible C++ Testing

GoogleTest brings to your C++ projects a comprehensive testing framework designed to make writing, organizing, and running tests straightforward and efficient. It embraces the familiar xUnit architecture and automates test discovery, empowering you to focus fully on validating your code. Whether you need rich assertions, parameterized tests, or robust death tests, GoogleTest integrates these features seamlessly to enhance your testing workflows.

### What You Gain by Using GoogleTest Features

- **Clean and structured test organization** through test suites and fixtures
- **Automatic detection and execution** of all tests, no manual registration needed
- **A rich library of assertions**, including support for custom assertions to capture specific conditions
- **Control over failure severity**, distinguishing between fatal and non-fatal failures for flexible test continuation
- **Parameterization capabilities** allowing tests to run over multiple values or types without duplication
- **Death tests** to validate behavior in failure and error-exit scenarios
- **Multiple execution options** for running individual tests, entire suites, or tests in parallel

### This Page Is For

C++ developers and QA engineers who want a concise, benefit-oriented overview of GoogleTest's core testing features.

## Core Features Explained

### 1. xUnit Architecture

At its heart, GoogleTest follows the established xUnit testing pattern, familiar to users of JUnit or PyUnit. Tests are grouped logically into **test suites** that reflect your code's structure. This organization improves clarity, ease of maintenance, and test discovery.

### 2. Automatic Test Discovery

Forget about manually registering each test. GoogleTest automatically collects all your tests defined via macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()` at runtime. This allows you to add or remove tests without changing registration code.

### 3. Rich and Custom Assertions

GoogleTest provides a powerful set of assertions to test various conditions:

- Equality, inequality, and relational checks
- String and floating-point comparisons
- Exception assertions
- Predicate assertions and support for user-defined assertions for specialized testing needs

Example:
```c++
ASSERT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5) << "Addition result was incorrect";
EXPECT_TRUE(isValid(result)) << "Result validation failed";
```

### 4. Fatal and Non-Fatal Failures

Differentiate between **fatal** failures (`ASSERT_*`) which abort the current test function immediately, and **non-fatal** failures (`EXPECT_*`) which log the failure but allow the test to continue. This distinction helps maximize information gained from a test run by continuing after recoverable errors.

### 5. Value-Parameterized Tests

Run the same test logic multiple times with different data inputs, which reduces code duplication and increases coverage.

Example:
```c++
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};
TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesInput) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Inputs, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 5, 8));
```

### 6. Type-Parameterized Tests

Verify that a family of types conforms to specified behavior without repeating test logic for each type.

Example:
```c++
template<typename T>
class StackTest : public testing::Test {
  // ...
};
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(StackTest, MyTypes);
TYPED_TEST(StackTest, PushPopWorks) {
  // Test logic using TypeParam
}
```

### 7. Death Tests

Validate error handling by verifying your code terminates (dies) in expected ways during failure scenarios. Essential for testing assertions, invalid inputs, or fatal conditions.

Example:
```c++
TEST(FooDeathTest, DiesOnNull) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(Foo(nullptr), "null pointer");
}
```

### 8. Flexible Test Run Options

GoogleTest supports:

- Running all tests in a suite or program
- Filtering tests by names or patterns
- Running tests in a specific order or randomized
- Sharding tests across multiple machines
- Running tests in parallel

These options help optimize test execution time and support CI/CD workflows.

## Getting Started Preview

To start exploring GoogleTest features:

1. Include the `<gtest/gtest.h>` header in your test files.
2. Define tests using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or parameterized test macros.
3. Run tests via `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` function after initializing with `InitGoogleTest()`.

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Explore detailed guides on [Writing Your First Test](/guides/getting-started/create-first-test) and [Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests](/guides/real-world-practices/parameterized-and-type-tests).

<Tip>
Start small with simple tests and assertions, then progressively incorporate parameterized tests and death tests to fully leverage GoogleTest's power.

# Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- **Tests not running?** Verify you are using the `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` macros to define tests and that you call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- **Unexpected test failures stop all tests?** Use `EXPECT_*` instead of `ASSERT_*` to allow subsequent tests to continue.
- **Dead tests causing confusing failures?** Name test suites containing death tests with `*DeathTest` to ensure proper ordering.
- **Non-unique test names or underscores in names?** Avoid underscores in test and test suite names to prevent naming conflicts and improve readability.

<Tip>
Use `--gtest_list_tests` to verify that your tests are discovered properly.
</Tip>

# Best Practices

- Group logically related tests into test suites reflecting your code architecture.
- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) to reuse common setup/teardown code.
- Prefer non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) where feasible to maximize feedback per run.
- Harness parameterized tests to cover a wide input space efficiently.
- Use death tests thoughtfully to verify robust error handling.
- Leverage flags and environment variables to customize test execution based on context.
