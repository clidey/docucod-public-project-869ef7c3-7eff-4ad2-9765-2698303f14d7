# Supported Platforms & Compatibility

GoogleTest is designed to be a versatile and portable C++ testing framework, supporting a broad range of operating systems, compilers, and build tools. This page outlines the officially supported environments, clarifies compatibility details vital for adoption, and helps you understand where and how GoogleTest can be reliably used in your projects.

---

## Why Platform Compatibility Matters

As C++ projects often span different development environments and target platforms, selecting a testing framework that matches your ecosystem is critical. GoogleTest's extensive platform compatibility ensures that your tests remain consistent, reliable, and maintainable — no matter where or how your code runs.

By understanding supported platforms and compilers upfront, you can avoid unexpected build or runtime issues and streamline integration into your continuous development workflows.

---

## Officially Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of operating systems, spanning common desktop, server, mobile, and embedded platforms. Among the officially supported OSes are:

- **Linux** (including various flavors like Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
- **Windows** (desktop variants, excluding Windows Mobile environments)
- **macOS** (full support for regular Mac OS X versions)
- **FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD**
- **Android** (limited but functional support)
- **Solaris and Illumos derivatives**

In addition, GoogleTest has medical or experimental support for multiple other UNIX-like or embedded systems, though these may not have the same level of stability or coverage.

> Note: Windows Mobile and some lightweight embedded platforms (e.g., ESP8266, QURT) are not supported due to limited system-level features.

---

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest requires a C++17-capable compiler and maintains compatibility with the following mainstream compilers:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** — versions supporting C++17 and later
- **Clang/LLVM** — fully supported with C++17 features
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** — Visual Studio 2017 and newer
- **Intel C++ Compiler** — versions meeting C++17 requirements

### C++17 Requirement

GoogleTest mandates that your build environment must support at least the C++17 standard. This is essential because GoogleTest leverages modern language features for improved safety, clarity, and performance.

If your project is not already configured to use C++17, update your build scripts accordingly, for example:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

or add appropriate compiler flags in your build system.

### Exceptions and RTTI

Compatibility options exist for environments with or without exceptions or RTTI (Run-Time Type Information), but some GoogleTest features may depend on these being enabled. Refer to the `gtest-port.h` configuration for fine-grained control.

---

## Build Tools Compatibility

GoogleTest can be built and integrated using a variety of build systems, including but not limited to:

- **CMake:** GoogleTest provides official CMake support with presets and options to build both GoogleTest and GoogleMock cleanly across platforms.
- **Bazel:** Supported by users who integrate GoogleTest in large mono-repos.
- **Manual Builds/Makefiles:** If preferred, you can compile GoogleTest directly from source using your compiler's command-line interface.

### CMake Recommended

Using CMake greatly simplifies handling platform-specific quirks, compiler flags, and build options. GoogleTest ships with a `CMakeLists.txt` that supports many environments out of the box.

## Summary of Platform Features and Limitations

| Feature/Platform                               | Support Status          | Notes                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux (including Android)                      | Fully supported        | Android support depends on API level >= 9                  |
| Windows Desktop                               | Fully supported        | Recommended to use Visual Studio 2017 or newer             |
| macOS (including Xcode builds)                | Fully supported        | Both command-line and Xcode toolchains supported           |
| BSD Variants                                  | Supported              | FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly                          |
| Solaris, Illumos                              | Supported              | Requires platform-specific build adjustments                |
| Embedded platforms (ESP8266, QURT, etc.)     | Not supported          | Missing system features prevent full compatibility           |
| Windows Mobile & Phone                        | Not supported          | Limited OS-level APIs and threading support                 |

## Platform Detection and Configuration

GoogleTest uses predefined macros and extensive internal checks to identify the platform and configure itself accordingly:

- Platform macros like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, etc., help GoogleTest internally tailor features.
- Compiler flags and options in headers such as `gtest-port.h` let advanced users override or customize behavior to suit unusual environments.

This automatic adaptation is critical for seamless cross-platform use.

---

## Practical Tips for Ensuring Compatibility

- **Verify C++17 support:** Confirm your compiler and build system target at least C++17.
- **Check threading support:** GoogleTest’s thread safety depends on pthreads availability or Windows threading primitives.
- **Use recommended build options:** For Windows, consider setting `gtest_force_shared_crt` to match runtime libraries.
- **Leverage CMake:** Simplifies dependency and platform management.
- **Define relevant macros for custom environments:** See [Customization Points](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md) for ways to modify internal behaviors.

---

## Troubleshooting Platform Compatibility Issues

If you encounter issues relating to platform or compiler incompatibility, consider these common checks:

- Ensure the compiler version supports C++17 features.
- Verify that threading support is enabled and correctly linked.
- Check if your environment is suppressed or missing filesystem support, which can affect death tests and stream redirection.
- Review any custom macros or compiler options that might disable key GoogleTest features.
- Consult build logs for missing dependencies or linkage errors.

If problems persist, consult the community or file an issue on the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).
