# Core Testing Features

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive set of core testing capabilities designed to empower developers with robust, flexible means to write, organize, and execute C++ tests efficiently. This page guides you through the essential features built into GoogleTest that help streamline your testing process and deliver clear, actionable feedback.

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest eliminates the need for manual test registration. Each test you define using the provided macros is automatically discovered and registered with the framework at runtime. This means you only need to focus on writing your tests without worrying about maintaining lists or configurations for test execution.

**What you achieve:**
- Zero registration overhead
- All tests included in test runs by default
- Tests can be added or removed simply by editing source code


## Rich Assertion Macros

Assertions are the building blocks of your tests. GoogleTest offers a rich library of macros to verify conditions and report failures:

- `EXPECT_*` assertions generate nonfatal failures, allowing the test to continue and report multiple problems in a single run.
- `ASSERT_*` assertions generate fatal failures and abort the current test function immediately for conditions where continuation is meaningless or dangerous.

Assertions include comparisons for equality, inequality, relational operators, string comparisons, floating-point approximations, exception expectations, and more.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Detailed failure message";
ASSERT_TRUE(condition) << "This must be true, or test aborts";
EXPECT_THROW(callFunction(), std::runtime_error);
```

**Why it matters:**
- Fine control over test flow after failures
- Informative failure messages for swift debugging
- Broad coverage of common verification scenarios


## User-Defined Assertions

If the built-in assertions do not meet your needs, GoogleTest allows you to create custom assertions by writing functions that return an `AssertionResult` object. This enables detailed success or failure messages paired with complex logic.

Example predicate assertion function:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess() << n << " is even";
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(NumberTest, EvenCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(4));
  EXPECT_FALSE(IsEven(3));
}
```

**Benefit:** Gives you maximum flexibility to tailor assertions to your domain and provides clearer failure diagnostics.


## Death Test Support

GoogleTest supports death tests, which verify that code terminates the process under certain conditions, such as encountering fatal errors or invalid states. Death tests can be used to assert that your code terminates as expected when facing invalid inputs or critical failures.

Key macros include:

- `ASSERT_DEATH(statement, matcher)`
- `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, matcher)`
- `ASSERT_EXIT(statement, predicate, matcher)`

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, DieOnNull) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(Foo(nullptr), "null pointer");
}
```

**Why use death tests:**
- Validates that your code handles error conditions robustly
- Confirms that fatal safeguards and assertions in your code trigger correctly


## Value- and Type-Parameterized Tests

Testing a variety of inputs or data types traditionally required writing many test cases. GoogleTest simplifies this through:

### Value-Parameterized Tests

Define tests that run multiple times with different data values:

```cpp
class MyValueTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyValueTest, CheckValueIsPositive) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveValues, MyValueTest,
                         testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 10));
```

*Features:*
- Data-driven testing without duplicating test code
- Flexible parameter generators (`Values`, `Range`, `Bool`, `Combine`, etc.)
- Custom name generation for clarity in test reports

### Type-Parameterized Tests

Run the same test logic with different types:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public ::testing::Test {};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, std::string>;

TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, CanBeDefaultConstructed) {
  TypeParam value{};
  SUCCEED();
}
```

*Features:*
- Verify interface compliance across types
- Simplify testing generic code
- Reusable type lists with clear test instantiations

### Type-Parameterized Test Suites

A more advanced pattern to define type-parameterized tests separately from their instantiations, enabling abstract tests reusable across multiple type lists.


## Flexible Test Execution and Reporting

GoogleTest provides a rich toolkit to control how tests are executed and reported:

- Run individual tests or subsets matching name patterns using test filters.
- Repeat tests multiple times to catch flaky or intermittent failures.
- Shuffle test order to expose hidden dependencies.
- Run tests in parallel or in shards to reduce overall test duration.
- Generate detailed reports in XML or JSON formats enabling integration with CI/CD systems.

Command line flags and environment variables provide these controls, for example:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.* --gtest_repeat=10 --gtest_shuffle
```


## Why GoogleTest Core Features Matter

GoogleTest turns complex testing needs into manageable workflows by automating discovery, providing rich assertion tools, enabling flexible parameterization, and supporting error and exit condition validations. Its flexible execution controls and detailed reporting empower teams to integrate testing seamlessly into their development process.

By using GoogleTest's core testing features, you achieve:

- Faster development cycles by reducing boilerplate
- Clear, precise feedback for easier debugging
- Confidence through extensive test coverage across values and types
- Scalable execution to fit small projects and large CI pipelines alike


## Getting Started

To begin using these core testing features:

1. Include the main GoogleTest header:

   ```cpp
   #include <gtest/gtest.h>
   ```

2. Write your tests using the macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and `TYPED_TEST()`.
3. Initialize GoogleTest in your `main()`:

   ```cpp
   int main(int argc, char** argv) {
     ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
     return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
   }
   ```
4. Build and run your test binary.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `EXPECT_` assertions over `ASSERT_` when possible** to allow tests to collect multiple failures, enhancing diagnostic effectiveness.
- **Structure tests with fixtures (`TEST_F`) when multiple tests share setup and teardown logic.**
- **Take advantage of value- and type-parameterized tests to avoid duplication and increase coverage.**
- **Leverage death tests to test that your code fails as expected in invalid scenarios.**
- **Use custom assertions with meaningful messages to clarify complex test logic.**
- **Employ command-line flags and environment variables to control execution order, filtering, and reporting.**


## Common Pitfalls

- Avoid relying on the order of test execution; tests should be independent.
- Beware of writing fatal assertions (`ASSERT_`) in non-void functions or constructors.
- When writing death tests, remember side effects in the death test child process won't affect the parent process.
- Always initialize GoogleTest with `InitGoogleTest()` before running tests.
- Do not ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.


## Troubleshooting

- If tests are not discovered, ensure test macros are used correctly and your build system links the test code.
- Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to verify which tests are registered.
- If assertions do not behave as expected, check if exceptions are enabled or if flags like `throw_on_failure` are set.
