# Feature Overview

## A Concise Tour of GoogleTest and GoogleMock Capabilities

This page presents a streamlined introduction to the main features offered by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Whether you are new or returning, this tour highlights key testing and mocking functionalities, helping you understand what is possible and why it matters for your C++ testing workflows.

---

## Unit Testing Made Easy

GoogleTest enables you to write robust unit tests for your C++ code with minimal boilerplate. Define test cases using simple macros like `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` to organize your tests logically and reuse common setup and teardown code via test fixtures.

### Example: Simple Unit Test
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```
This allows you to quickly verify behavior, isolate bugs, and automate validation across your codebase.

---

## Automated Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests in your test binary. Just compile your test code with GoogleTest and run the resulting executable—no manual registration needed. This streamlined workflow helps you scale your testing efforts effortlessly.

---

## Powerful Assertions

A rich set of assertions helps you check for expected conditions precisely:

- `EXPECT_*` macros perform soft assertions, allowing tests to continue.
- `ASSERT_*` macros perform hard assertions, stopping the test on failure.
- Support for equality, relational checks, exceptions, floating-point comparisons, and predicate matchers.

Assertions provide clear, helpful failure messages, speeding up diagnosis.

### Example: Using Assertions
```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));
ASSERT_NE(vector.size(), 0);
```

---

## Test Fixtures for Reusable Setup and Teardown

Use test fixtures to write common setup and cleanup code once and reuse it across many tests. This encourages DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and makes tests easier to manage.

### Example: Test Fixture
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryTest) {
  EXPECT_EQ(db.query("SELECT 1"), "1");
}
```

---

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports running the same test logic against multiple input values or types to maximize coverage with minimal duplication.

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run tests with various input parameters easily.
- **Typed Tests:** Test templates instantiated with different types.

This improves test scalability and reduces boilerplate.

---

## Mocking with GoogleMock

GoogleMock integrates with GoogleTest to provide comprehensive mocking capabilities:

- Create mock classes quickly by defining mock methods using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Set flexible expectations on method calls using `EXPECT_CALL` with argument matchers.
- Specify mock behaviors with actions (`WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`, etc.).
- Control call order and cardinality.
- Handle constness, overloaded methods, templates, and move-only types easily.

### Example: Mock Class and Expectation
```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PaintTest, DrawLine) {
  MockTurtle mock_turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, Forward(100)).Times(1);

  Painter painter(&mock_turtle);
  painter.DrawLine(100);
}
```

---

## Death Tests for Error Handling

GoogleTest supports death tests, allowing you to verify that specific code triggers process termination under invalid conditions. This is invaluable for testing asserts, invariants, and failure handling logic.

---

## Additional Testing Capabilities

- **Test Listeners:** Customize test reporting.
- **Test Result Reporting:** Access and manipulate test results programmatically.
- **Thread-safe mocks and tests:** Suitable for multithreaded code.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Start simple:** Use basic tests and mock behaviors before adding complexity.
- **Leverage fixtures:** Avoid duplicating setup code.
- **Use matchers effectively:** Specify only needed argument details to avoid brittle tests.
- **Control expectations wisely:** Don’t overconstrain your tests.
- **Combine tests with mocks:** Validate both state and interaction.

By progressively mastering these features, you'll write tests that are clear, robust, and valuable throughout your development lifecycle.
