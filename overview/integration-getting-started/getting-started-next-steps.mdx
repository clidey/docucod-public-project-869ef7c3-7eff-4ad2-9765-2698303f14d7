## Starting Points and Essential Resources

### The Online User’s Guide

The [online User’s Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/user-guide.html) provides a comprehensive walkthrough of everything you need to know about GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It covers core concepts, testing fundamentals, mock usage, assertions, and more, all organized to support beginner through advanced learning.

### GoogleTest Primer

The [GoogleTest Primer](../primer.md) introduces fundamental testing concepts with clear explanations and practical code examples. This primer will help you grasp why and how GoogleTest improves your testing workflows.

> **Example from the Primer:**
> ```cpp
> TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
>   EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
> }
> ```

### Setup and Configuration Documentation

Before writing tests, familiarize yourself with the [Setup & Requirements](../setup-requirements/prerequisites.md) and [Integration with C++ Environments](../integration-getting-started/integration-with-environments.mdx) documentation. These provide detailed instructions on how to integrate GoogleTest into your build systems like CMake or Bazel, and ensure compiler and platform compatibility.

### GoogleMock Getting Started

If you plan to use mocks to simulate dependencies and interactions, the [gMock for Dummies](../docs/gmock_for_dummies.md) guide is a popular entry point. It explains mocking concepts from the ground up and includes sample code.

## Practical Tips for Beginners

- **Always call `InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()` in `main()`** before running tests. These functions initialize the framework and parse command-line flags.

  ```cpp
  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

- **Use the provided `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries if you prefer not to write your own `main()` function.** These define standard entry points that initialize and run tests.

- **Start small.** Begin by writing a simple test case with `TEST()` or a test fixture with `TEST_F()`. Add complexity gradually.

- **Explore default behaviors and assertions first** before diving into mocks. This avoids cognitive overload.

- **Refer to examples and sample code often.** The documentation includes practical snippets that demonstrate standard patterns.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Warning>
Expectations in GoogleMock must be set *before* exercising the mock. Setting expectations after calling mock methods can lead to undefined behavior.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Overly strict or numerous expectations may cause fragile tests. Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for interaction verification.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Do not ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`. This ensures failures are correctly reported.
</Warning>

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Confirm that `InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()` is called once.
- Verify your build system correctly includes GoogleTest headers and links to libraries.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` command-line flag to increase diagnostic logging.
- Run tests in isolation to detect environmental or integration issues.

## Next Steps

Once comfortable with the basics, progress to:

- [Writing Your First Test](../first-use/writing-first-test.md) to create meaningful test cases.
- [Mocking Dependencies with GoogleMock](../getting_started_core_workflows/mocking_dependencies.md) for advanced interaction testing.
- [Running and Interpreting Test Results](../first-use/running-tests.md) to learn test output analysis.
