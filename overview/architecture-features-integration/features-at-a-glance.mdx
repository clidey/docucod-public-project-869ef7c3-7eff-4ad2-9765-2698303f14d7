# Feature Overview: Test, Assert, Mock

Explore the essential features of GoogleTest that enable comprehensive C++ testing: the xUnit test structure, assertions for validating code behavior, powerful mocking capabilities, and flexible test execution options. This page serves as a quick reference to these primary features and guides you to deeper documentation to master each capability.

## Core Testing Features At a Glance

- **xUnit-Conformant Test Structure**: Organize your tests into suites that mirror your code structure, isolating tests for clean and reproducible runs.
- **Rich Assertions Library**: Verify conditions using a vast set of assertion macros, from simple Boolean checks to complex value comparisons and exception testing.
- **Custom Assertions**: Extend test expressiveness by defining your own assertions tailored to your code’s logic.
- **Death Tests**: Confirm that your code terminates or crashes as expected under specific conditions to validate error handling.
- **Failure Control**: Choose between fatal and nonfatal failures to control test flow, allowing multiple assertion failures per test.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test logic repeatedly across sets of values or types using value- and type-parameterized tests.
- **Mock Support with GoogleMock**: Define mock classes and expectations to isolate dependencies and test module interactions thoroughly.
- **Matcher Libraries**: Use an expressive set of matchers to specify argument expectations in mock calls and assertions.
- **Test Execution Options**: Filter, shuffle, repeat, or selectively disable tests with command-line flags and environment variables.

## Understanding the Test Structure

GoogleTest implements the xUnit architecture, meaning your tests are organized into ***test suites*** (formerly known as *test cases*) which group related individual ***tests***.

Each test is a discrete function that exercises a specific code path with assertions checking expected outcomes.

Use the `TEST()` macro for simple tests and `TEST_F()` when tests share setup via a fixture class.

Run tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which discovers and executes all registered tests automatically.

## Assertions: Validate and Verify Your Code

Assertions are the heart of test verification. GoogleTest provides paired macros:

- `EXPECT_` for **nonfatal assertions** that record failures but let the test continue.
- `ASSERT_` for **fatal assertions** that abort the current function on failure.

### Common Assertion Types

- **Boolean Conditions**: `EXPECT_TRUE()`, `EXPECT_FALSE()`.
- **Equality and Comparison**: `EXPECT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NE()`, `EXPECT_LT()`, `EXPECT_GT()`, etc.
- **String Comparisons**: `EXPECT_STREQ()`, `EXPECT_STRNE()`, and case-insensitive variants.
- **Floating-Point Comparisons**: `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ()`, and tolerance checks via `EXPECT_NEAR()`.
- **Exception Assertions**: Ensure code throws or does not throw as expected with `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW()`, and similar.
- **Predicate Assertions**: Use custom boolean functions or predicate-formatters for more nuanced validations.
- **Death Assertions**: Confirm code causes the process to terminate using `EXPECT_DEATH()` and related macros.

### Custom Failure Messages

All assertions accept streaming of explanatory failure messages using the `<<` operator to provide context.

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value, expected) << "Value did not match expected at index " << i;
```

### Flexible Assertion Macros

Use `EXPECT_THAT()` combined with GoogleMock matchers for powerful, readable checks (e.g., string patterns, container contents).

## Parameterized Testing for Broad Coverage

GoogleTest supports:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**: Repeat a test over multiple input values while reuse the same test logic.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)**: Repeat tests over multiple data types to validate generic code.

These help you avoid code duplication and ensure your code behaves correctly across a range of inputs and types.

Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to define parameter sets and `TEST_P`/`TYPED_TEST` macros to implement the tests.

---

## Death Tests: Validate Program Termination

Death tests verify that specific operations cause your program to crash or exit under controlled conditions, ensuring robustness of error checks.

Use macros like `EXPECT_DEATH()`, `ASSERT_DEATH()`, `EXPECT_EXIT()`, and `ASSERT_EXIT()`.

Death tests automatically run your code in a subprocess and confirm the expected termination behavior and error output.

**Tip:** Name your death test suites or fixtures with the suffix `DeathTest` to help GoogleTest run them correctly and safely.

## Mocking: Isolate and Test Interactions Using GoogleMock

GoogleMock is integrated with GoogleTest to provide powerful mocking capabilities for C++.

- **Defining Mocks**: Use `MOCK_METHOD()` to declare mock methods inside mock classes.

- **Setting Expectations**: The `EXPECT_CALL()` macro sets expectations for mock method invocations, including argument matchers, call counts, and invocation order.

- **Specifying Behavior**: Use chained actions like `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()` to control the behavior of mocks.

- **Mock Strictness Modes**:
  - `NiceMock` suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
  - `NaggyMock` warns on such calls.
  - `StrictMock` treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

- **Matchers**: Use expressive matchers to specify argument expectations precisely.

- **Sequences and Order**: The `Sequence` and `InSequence` helpers specify strict call orders.

<Callout title="Tip">
To manage complex mock scenarios, chain clauses in `EXPECT_CALL()` for precise control over the mock’s expected calls and result.

## Test Execution Options

GoogleTest offers multiple command-line flags and environment variables to control test execution:

- Filtering tests by name with `--gtest_filter`
- Listing tests with `--gtest_list_tests`
- Shuffling test order with `--gtest_shuffle`
- Repeating tests with `--gtest_repeat`
- Running disabled tests with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`
- Using random seeds to reproduce test sequences

These options enable flexible test runs optimized for development, continuous integration, or debugging.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use `EXPECT_` macros when you want to record failures but keep tests running to find multiple issues.
- Use `ASSERT_` macros when failure invalidates further test logic.
- Structure tests into suites that mirror the software modules for clarity and maintainability.
- Prefer fixtures (`TEST_F`) when tests share setup and teardown logic.
- Employ parameterized tests to increase coverage efficiently.
- Use mocking to isolate dependencies and verify interactions, improving test reliability.
- Compose mock expectations with clear argument matchers and call cardinalities.
- Leverage death tests to ensure your code enforces invariants and handles errors safely.
- Harness test execution flags early in development to accelerate iteration.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If an assertion macro generates a compilation error, verify you are using the correct `EXPECT_` vs `ASSERT_` according to your test function return type (fatal assertions require void functions).
- Death tests require specific naming conventions and isolated environment setups to function properly; naming test suites with the `DeathTest` suffix is mandatory.
- When mocking methods with complex arguments (e.g., types with commas like `std::pair` or `std::map`), wrap argument types in extra parentheses or use type aliases.
- If mocks trigger unexpected warnings or failures on uninteresting calls, adjust strictness modes using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to gracefully skip tests if environmental preconditions are not met.
