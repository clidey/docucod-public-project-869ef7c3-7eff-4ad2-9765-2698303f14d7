# Supported Platforms & Integration

## Overview

GoogleTest is designed to be a portable, high-quality C++ testing framework that runs smoothly across a diverse set of platforms, compilers, and build systems. This page outlines the supported environments for GoogleTest and describes how to seamlessly integrate it into popular build systems such as CMake and Bazel. Understanding these details enables you to accelerate your test automation process with minimal setup effort and ensures compatibility with your development workflow.

---

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to provide sustained support for widely used platforms and compilers. This guarantees reliable behavior across common development environments such as:

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows (including desktop and MinGW), macOS, FreeBSD, and other POSIX-compliant systems
- **Compilers:** GCC (with relatively recent versions), Clang, Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC, minimum VS2015), Intel C++ Compiler, SunPro, and others

Additionally, GoogleTest adapts automatically to platform-specific threading libraries (like pthreads on UNIX-like systems and native Windows threading) to ensure optimal thread-safety and parallel test execution.

**Note:** GoogleTest requires C++17 or later support from your compiler.

For a comprehensive, up-to-date listing of supported combinations, see the official policy matrix at [Google’s foundational C++ support list](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Build Systems Integration

GoogleTest has built-in support and instructions for integration with the most commonly used build systems in the C++ ecosystem. This section covers best practices to configure and link GoogleTest with two major build systems.

### CMake Integration

GoogleTest ships with official CMake build scripts that allow effortless incorporation into your projects. Key integration points include:

- **Standalone Build:** You can build GoogleTest by itself by cloning the repo and running CMake, as explained in the installation guides.
- **Direct Inclusion:** Use `add_subdirectory()` in your project's CMakeLists to include GoogleTest source directly, ensuring consistent compiler flags and settings.
- **Find Package Usage:** If GoogleTest is installed as a system package or via a package manager, use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` to locate it.
- **Linking Tests:** Link your test executables with targets like `GTest::gtest` and/or `GTest::gtest_main`.
- **Pkg-config Support:** GoogleTest provides pkg-config files (`gtest.pc`, `gtest_main.pc`) supplying all necessary compiler and linker flags.

Here is a minimal example demonstrating how to integrate GoogleTest using pkg-config in CMake:

```cmake
find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_search_module(GTEST REQUIRED gtest_main)

add_executable(sample_test samples/sample3_unittest.cc)
target_link_libraries(sample_test PRIVATE ${GTEST_LDFLAGS})
target_compile_options(sample_test PRIVATE ${GTEST_CFLAGS})

enable_testing()
add_test(NAME sample_test COMMAND sample_test)
```

#### Handling pkg-config Path Issues

If pkg-config cannot find GoogleTest on your system, ensure your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes the directory with GoogleTest `.pc` files. For example:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
```

In cross-compilation environments, additional configuration for `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` and `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` is required to correctly resolve paths. This ensures that compiler and linker flags point to the target sysroot.

---

### Bazel Integration

While GoogleTest primarily provides direct instructions for CMake, it is also frequently used in Bazel-based builds. Typically, you incorporate GoogleTest via Bazel’s native rules or via third-party repositories that host compatible build targets.

Key focuses include:

- Declaring `googletest` as a dependency in your `WORKSPACE` file.
- Linking test targets against `@com_google_googletest` targets.

Bazel users should refer to [GoogleTest Bazel integration best practices](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest#bazel) or their broader build ecosystem documentation.

## Key Dependencies & Upcoming Support

- **Threading:** GoogleTest uses native threading libraries. On UNIX-like systems, pthreads are required and managed automatically.
- **Abseil Library:** GoogleTest is moving towards integrating Abseil support for enhanced portability and feature capabilities, including flag management. Abseil support is partial and ongoing.

---

## Best Practices

- **Match Compiler Flags:** When integrating GoogleTest in your build, ensure the compiler and linker flags used to build GoogleTest match those of your own code, especially runtimes on Windows (static vs dynamic CRT).
- **Use Provided Targets:** Prefer linking test binaries against provided targets (`GTest::gtest`, `GTest::gtest_main`) instead of manual inclusion of source to get automatic handling of dependencies and flags.
- **Install and Reference:** If possible, install GoogleTest system-wide or in a centralized location and use `find_package` to reference it, simplifying project configuration.

<Tip>
On Windows, the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` can be set to ensure GoogleTest links dynamically to the CRT libraries, matching typical Visual Studio project defaults and avoiding linker conflicts.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Integration

If you encounter build or linking issues:

- Verify compiler support for C++17 and that all dependencies (like pthreads on Linux) are present.
- Confirm that pkg-config paths and environment variables are configured correctly.
- On Windows, verify that runtime library flags (static vs dynamic) are consistent between your project and GoogleTest builds.
- When using CMake, set verbose make output to inspect compiler and linker commands.

For common issues, see the [Troubleshooting Installation & Configuration](../getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/common-setup-issues) page.
