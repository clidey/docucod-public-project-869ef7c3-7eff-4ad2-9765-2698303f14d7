# Features at a Glance

Welcome to a concise introduction to GoogleTest’s standout features—crafted to empower you with an intuitive understanding of its capabilities and why it’s the go-to C++ testing framework for developers aiming for reliability, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Test Discovery and the xUnit Architecture

GoogleTest elegantly discovers tests in your codebase by scanning for your `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros, organizing them into test suites and individual test cases. This facilitates a clear structure:

- **Test Suites** group related test cases for modular organization.
- **Fixtures** (`TEST_F`) let you share common setup and teardown code across multiple tests, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.
- Built on the proven **xUnit architecture**, GoogleTest provides familiar workflows with setup, execution, and teardown phases.

This system removes the need for manual registration, streamlining the testing cycle so you can focus on test logic.

## Rich Assertions and Custom Assertions

GoogleTest offers an extensive set of assertion macros to validate expected values easily:

- Common assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, and `EXPECT_NE` cover most basic needs.
- Advanced assertions handle exceptions, death tests, floating-point comparisons, and predicate-based checks for complex conditions.
- Custom assertions empower you to create domain-specific checks with precise failure messages, enhancing test clarity and debugging.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(42, GetAnswer());
ASSERT_TRUE(IsReady());
```

## Parameterized Tests: Value and Type Parameterizations

Reuse test logic across multiple data points or types:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests** let you run the same test with different input values without duplicating code.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests** enable testing multiple implementations or types against the same interface or expected behavior.

This flexibility simplifies broad coverage and interface validation with minimal boilerplate.

Example snippet:
```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesVariousInputs) {
  int value = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(value));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Values, FooTest,
                         ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

## Robust Death and Failure Handling

GoogleTest supports death tests to verify that your code fails gracefully or aborts under expected failure conditions.

- Executed safely in child processes.
- Provides detailed matching of exit codes and error messages.
- Can be configured for thread safety or performance.

The framework distinguishes between fatal and nonfatal failures, helping you control test flow with macros like `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*`.

## Flexible and Extensive Test Running Options

GoogleTest equips you to shape your test runs with ease:

- Filter which tests to run using patterns and wildcards.
- Shuffle or repeat tests to detect flaky behavior.
- Generate XML or JSON reports for CI/CD pipelines or custom analysis.
- Control output verbosity and color for better readability.

These options help integrate smoothly into varied development and automation workflows.

## Advanced Capabilities and User Guidance

- Support for **user-defined assertions and matchers** lets you tailor verification to complex or domain-specific problems.
- Integration with GoogleMock allows seamless creation and control of mock objects for testing dependencies.
- Detailed event listeners enable custom reporting and diagnostic logging.
- Sophisticated control over the order of mock calls, including sequences and partial orders.

## Practical Example: A Simple Parameterized Test

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class PrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

bool IsPrime(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false;
  for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) return false;
  }
  return true;
}

TEST_P(PrimeTest, IsPrimeReturnsTrueForPrimes) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(GetParam()));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    Primes,
    PrimeTest,
    ::testing::Values(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17));
```

This defines a parameterized test verifying that the `IsPrime()` function returns `true` for known prime numbers.
