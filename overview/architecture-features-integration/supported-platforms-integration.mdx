# Supported Platforms & Integrations

## Overview

GoogleTest is designed to be a reliable, scalable, and portable C++ testing framework that runs seamlessly across a wide range of platforms, compilers, and build systems. This page summarizes the officially supported environments and introduces common integrations to help you efficiently incorporate GoogleTest into your development workflow.

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring compatibility across commonly used platforms and compilers. The current matrix of supported compilers, platforms, and build tools is maintained and accessible for reference.

- **Platforms:** GoogleTest supports major operating systems including Linux, Windows (Desktop, MinGW), macOS, and various BSD variants. Mobile and embedded platforms have more limited support.
- **Compilers:** Compatibility covers modern C++17-capable compilers such as GCC, Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 and above), and others that meet the requisite language standards.
- **Build Systems:** Official support for building with CMake is robust, with additional integrations into other build systems possible through documented approaches.

### Practical Tips

- Ensure your compiler supports at least C++17, as it is a strict prerequisite for building and using GoogleTest.
- On Windows using Visual Studio, watch out for runtime library mismatches; GoogleTest provides the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime linking with your project.
- For multi-threaded tests, verify that your environment supports pthreads (Linux/macOS) or appropriate threading primitives on Windows.

## Canonical Integrations

Integrating GoogleTest into your environment is straightforward with out-of-the-box support for various IDEs, test adapters, and runners. This section introduces notable integration points and dependencies.

### IDE and Editor Support

- **Visual Studio / VS Code:** GoogleTest integrates well with Visual Studio test explorers and VS Code extensions that support GoogleTest detection and execution.
- **Test Runners:** Common CI/CD systems and test runners can invoke GoogleTest binaries and parse the output, facilitating automated testing workflows.

### Adapters and Output Listeners

GoogleTest implements standardized interfaces for:
- Test execution adapters that allow test selection and run orchestration.
- Output listeners for capturing and formatting test results in multiple formats (XML, JSON), aiding in integration with dashboards and continuous integration pipelines.

### Forthcoming Dependencies

GoogleTest is moving towards depending on the [Abseil (Absl)](https://abseil.io/) library for some internal functionality:
- _Abseil integration_ will enhance efficiency and enable more advanced C++ features internally.
- This dependency is being introduced cautiously to maintain backward compatibility.

## How This Page Fits Into the Documentation

This page links directly with both introductory and advanced documentation areas:
- For installation prerequisites and system requirements, see the [System Requirements](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/installation-prerequisites/system-requirements) page.
- For guidance on build integration details, refer to [Integrating with Bazel and CMake](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/guides/integration-solutions/build-integration).
- For detailed platform-specific tips, explore the [Platform-Specific Test Guidance](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/guides/integration-solutions/platform-guides).

## Getting Started With Your Platform

Getting up and running requires:
- Confirming your target platform and compiler version against the compatibility matrix.
- Selecting and configuring your build environment, most commonly CMake.
- Optionally enabling special build flags to accommodate platform-specific quirks.

### Sample: Building with CMake

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
dcd googletest
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install # Optionally install
```

Use `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` if you want only GoogleTest.

### Best Practices

- Always keep your tooling and compiler updated to benefit from the latest fixes.
- When working in multi-platform environments, automate verification of supported configurations early in your CI pipeline.
- Leverage GoogleTest’s thread safety where pthreads or native threads are supported to build fully concurrent tests.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Runtime Library Mismatches:** Dynamic vs static CRT linkage on Windows requires consistent configuration via the `gtest_force_shared_crt` flag.
- **Thread Safety Issues:** On platforms without pthread support, GoogleTest disables threading; be mindful when porting tests designed for concurrency.
- **Unrecognized Platforms:** If using GoogleTest on less common or emerging platforms, you might encounter limited support or need to contribute patches.

For detailed troubleshooting steps, see [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting-validation/common-setup-issues).

## Summary

GoogleTest offers broad platform and compiler coverage, ensuring that developers can write and run tests consistently across most environments where C++ runs. By following the official support matrix and leveraging canonical integrations with IDEs and build tools, you establish a solid foundation for reliable and scalable testing.
