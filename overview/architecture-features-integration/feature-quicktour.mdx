# Feature Quicktour

Get a rapid glimpse of GoogleTest's standout capabilities designed to streamline and empower your C++ testing workflows. This quicktour spotlights automated test discovery, versatile assertions, parameterized tests, death tests for robust error condition handling, and seamless integration with GoogleMock for advanced mocking.

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs your tests without manual registration. Tests are organized into test cases and test suites, allowing you to write them naturally without worrying about wiring them into a central registry.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyClassTest, DoesSomething) {
  // Your test code here
}
```

After compiling your tests, simply run the binary; GoogleTest finds `TEST` macros and executes them.

## Rich Assertions

GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions to check conditions and values. There are fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) that abort the current test on failure, and non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) that let tests continue.

Examples:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(42, result);    // Checks equality, continues after failure
ASSERT_NE(nullptr, ptr);  // Checks inequality, aborts test on failure
```

You can combine these with helpers to validate complex logic clearly and succinctly.

### Custom Assertions

Beyond built-ins, GoogleTest supports custom assertions and matchers, letting you shape error messages and validation logic to your project's domain.

## Parameterized Tests

To avoid repetitive test code, you can write tests that run multiple times with different parameters.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, DoesBar) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, FooTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

Parameterized tests boost coverage while keeping your test code clean and DRY.

## Death Tests

GoogleTest supports tests that verify your program terminates or crashes under specific conditions, essential for catching fatal errors or invalid states.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, CrashesOnNull) {
  EXPECT_DEATH({ Foo(nullptr); }, "null pointer");
}
```

They ensure that your code fails gracefully and predictably.

## Seamless Integration with GoogleMock

GoogleMock is GoogleTest's mocking framework. With GoogleMock, you can define mock objects to simulate and verify interactions with dependencies.

Typical workflow:

1. Define a mock class using `MOCK_METHOD()` macros.
2. Set expectations using `EXPECT_CALL()`.
3. Use the mock in your test to check interactions.

Example:

```cpp
class MockTurtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), ());
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));

  Painter p(&turtle);
  p.DrawLine(100);
}
```

This tight integration allows you to focus on testing behavior rather than writing boilerplate scaffolding.

## Summary

This quicktour showcases the breadth of GoogleTest's capabilities:

- Automatic test discovery and execution
- Flexible, expressive assertions
- Parameterized tests for scalable coverage
- Specialized death tests for robustness
- Rich integration with GoogleMock for mocking dependencies
