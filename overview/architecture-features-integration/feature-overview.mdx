# Feature Overview

GoogleTest’s feature-rich framework empowers C++ developers with comprehensive testing and mocking capabilities designed to boost code quality and developer productivity. This page summarizes the key functionalities you’ll leverage daily to write expressive, maintainable, and efficient test suites.

---

## Core Functionalities at a Glance

- **xUnit-Style Testing Framework**: Write clear, structured tests using familiar constructs like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()` (fixtures), and assertions such as `EXPECT_EQ()` and `ASSERT_TRUE()` that provide robust investigation points.

- **Automatic Test Discovery**: Seamlessly execute your entire test suite without manual registration. GoogleTest automatically detects all tests under your test binary, enabling effortless and comprehensive test runs.

- **Rich Assertion Library**: Benefit from an extensive collection of assertions that not only check conditions but also provide detailed failure messages, making debugging fast and intuitive.

- **Flexible Mocking Framework (gMock)**: Create mock classes effortlessly to isolate dependencies, specify function call expectations, behaviors, and argument matching with unparalleled precision.

- **Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests**: Write a test logic once and run it against multiple input datasets or types, reducing duplication and expanding coverage efficiently.

- **Custom Assertions and Matchers**: Extend the default set with your own predicates and matchers to capture domain-specific validation scenarios.

- **Versatile Test Execution Controls**:
  - Parallel test execution to speed up your validation cycles.
  - Control test execution order with sequencing and ordering constraints.
  - Selective test filtering and repeated runs for focused diagnostics.


## Deep Dive into Features

### xUnit-Style Testing

GoogleTest adopts the popular xUnit pattern, letting tests be organized logically into suites and cases. Test fixtures (`TEST_F`) enable shared setup and teardown operations for related tests, facilitating reusable, clear test logic. Assertions halt test execution on fatal failures, or continue on non-fatal, giving you flexible error-handling tailored to your test objectives.

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, CanAddNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 3, 5);
  ASSERT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));
}

class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    buffer_.resize(100);
  }
  std::vector<int> buffer_;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, OperatesOnBuffer) {
  EXPECT_FALSE(buffer_.empty());
}
```

### Automatic Test Discovery

Simply add your tests to the binary, link with GoogleTest, and run. GoogleTest scans and runs all tests automatically, eliminating manual test list maintenance and enabling smoother continuous integration workflows.

### Rich Assertions

Assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`, `EXPECT_THROW`, and many more let you verify a wide spectrum of conditions. They provide detailed output on failure, including values that failed, call location, and stack traces, accelerating root cause analysis.

### GoogleMock Usability Highlights

The mocking framework lets you generate mock classes with minimal effort using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro, which captures method signatures to produce fully functional mocks.

By expressing expected function calls, call counts (`Times()`), argument value constraints (via matchers like `_`, `Eq()`, `Gt()`, and composite matchers), and scripted behaviors (`WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`), you gain tight control over the interaction between your components.

Multiple expectations per method are supported, and you can order calls strictly or partially with `InSequence`, `After()`, and `RetiresOnSaturation()`, enabling precise interaction tests.

### Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

Reuse a single test definition to run across a range of values or types. This feature promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and broadens test coverage with minimal overhead.

Example of parameterized tests:

```cpp
class PrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(PrimeTest, CheckPrime) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PrimeValues,
                         PrimeTest,
                         ::testing::Values(2, 3, 5, 7, 11));
```

### Custom Assertions and Matchers

While GoogleTest provides many built-in matchers, you can define your own to express complex domain logic clearly. Use the `MATCHER()` macros or implement matcher classes to achieve this extensibility.

### Test Execution Controls

Control the flow and scaling of your tests effectively:

- Run tests in parallel via test runner options to reduce overall build-test cycles.
- Enforce call order with sequences or explicit dependencies.
- Filter tests by name or tag for focused runs.
- Support for death tests, retry, and repeated test execution to enhance robustness.

## Best Practices & Tips

- Prefer writing expectations before exercising functionality to catch failures early.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations meant for limited sequential calls to avoid sticky expectation issues.
- Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors, and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for calls where invocation verification is essential.
- Apply `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` to change mock behavior on uninteresting calls to match your testing tolerance.
- Leverage parameterized tests to minimize duplication and maximize coverage.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- Failing to mark methods as `virtual` in base classes leads to mock methods not being called.
- Beware of over-specifying expectations causing brittle tests.
- Use test filtering and sequences to control test execution order and reduce flaky tests.
- For functions returning references, use `ReturnRef()` instead of `Return()`.
