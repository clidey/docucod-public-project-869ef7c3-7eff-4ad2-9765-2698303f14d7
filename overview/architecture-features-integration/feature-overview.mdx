# Feature Overview

GoogleTest offers a rich and flexible set of features designed to empower C++ developers in creating robust, maintainable, and efficient tests. This page distills the core capabilities that make GoogleTest a powerful choice for testing, including foundational xUnit support, expressive assertions, comprehensive test discovery, and advanced parameterized and typed testing mechanisms.

---

## Essential xUnit Support

At its heart, GoogleTest embraces the xUnit architecture, making it familiar and intuitive for developers acquainted with other unit testing frameworks. The framework provides:

- **Test Suites and Tests:** Logical grouping of tests into test suites for organized and manageable test code.
- **Test Fixtures:** Enables sharing setup and teardown code across multiple tests, reducing duplication and fostering consistency.
- **Flexible Test Execution:** Runs each test in isolation, ensuring tests remain independent and results reproducible.

### Defining Tests
You write tests using simple macros like `TEST` and `TEST_F` for basic and fixture-based tests respectively:

```cpp
TEST(MySuite, TestName) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, ComputeSomething());
}

class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { Init(); }
  void TearDown() override { CleanUp(); }
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, UsesFixture) {
  ASSERT_TRUE(CheckState());
}
```

This structure keeps the testing code clean and directly focused on validation logic.

---

## Rich and Flexible Assertions

GoogleTest offers an extensive collection of assertion macros that enable validation of diverse conditions:

- `EXPECT_*` vs. `ASSERT_*`: Expectations generate non-fatal failures allowing tests to continue, while assertions generate fatal failures aborting a test function early.
- Support for comparisons, strings, floating-point, exceptions, and regular expressions.
- Ability to stream custom failure messages to aid debugging.

Example of using assertions with detailed messages:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Result does not match expected value.";
ASSERT_TRUE(IsValid(input)) << "Input validation failed.";
```

These assertions assure clear, actionable error diagnostics when tests fail.

---

## Automated Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest manages test registration automatically, removing the need for manual listing. This feature allows:

- Seamless addition of new tests without touching existing test runners.
- Running all tests simply with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Custom filtering and running subsets of tests via command-line flags.

The framework isolates tests, runs them in fresh fixture instances, and reports summary statistics.

---

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports advanced test patterns that dramatically reduce code duplication and increase coverage:

### Parameterized Tests (Value-Parameterized)

- Define test fixtures that receive parameters allowing you to run the same test logic over multiple input values.
- Use `TEST_P` and instantiate with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` combined with parameter generators like `Values()`, `Range()`, `Bool()`, or `Combine()`.

Example:

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(0, GetParam() % 2);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyParamTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```

### Typed Tests

- Write tests once but run them for multiple types by defining templated fixture classes.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` macros to declare and define typed tests.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class StackTest : public testing::Test {
  // ...
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, std::string>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(StackTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(StackTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(this->stack_.IsEmpty());
}
```

### Type-Parameterized Tests

- Similar to typed tests but allow defining test logic first, then instantiating with different sets of types separately.

---

## Additional Capabilities

- **Death Tests:** Verify that code terminates as expected in specific error conditions.
- **User-Defined and Built-In Assertions:** Extend testing with custom predicates and integrate seamlessly with GoogleMock matchers.
- **Flexible Execution Controls:** Fine-grained test filtering, repetition, sharding, and skipping facilitate optimized test runs.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions when you want tests to continue after failures to get comprehensive feedback.
- Use fixtures (`TEST_F`) when multiple tests share setup to avoid duplication.
- Apply parameterized tests for data-driven testing to cover many scenarios with concise code.
- Name test suites thoughtfully without underscores to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected issues.
- Combine death tests with the naming convention `*DeathTest` for better execution and ordering behavior.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Using `ASSERT_*` in constructors or destructors (fatal assertions should be avoided there).
- Forgetting to instantiate parameterized tests after defining them leading to silent failures or test misses.
- Misusing `TEST_F` and `TEST_P` macros interchangeably, resulting in confusing compiler errors.
- Not calling `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which disrupts command-line flag parsing.

Following GoogleTest's guidance on these will make your testing journey smoother.
