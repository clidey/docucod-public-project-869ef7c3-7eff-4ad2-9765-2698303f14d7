# Feature Summary

## Discover the Power of GoogleTest

GoogleTest is a comprehensive and flexible C++ testing framework that empowers you to write, organize, and run robust tests with unmatched ease. This Feature Summary page unveils the major capabilities that make GoogleTest the trusted choice for developers aiming to build reliable, maintainable, and scalable test suites.

Whether you are validating simple logic, crafting complex data-driven tests, or verifying behavior under failure conditions, GoogleTest provides actionable tools tailor-made for your needs.

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Rich Assertions Framework:** Extensive macros to assert conditions, compare values, check exceptions, perform floating-point comparisons, and even create custom predicate assertions.

- **Test Discovery and Organization:** Automatic test registration with `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`, grouping into test suites, support for test fixtures, and hierarchical test structure.

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with multiple input values effortlessly using `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`, enabling data-driven testing.

- **Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests:** Test code over multiple types with `TYPED_TEST` and `TYPED_TEST_P`, reducing duplicates and validating template code.

- **Death Tests:** Safely test that code terminates as expected in failure scenarios, crucial for error handling verification.

- **Mock Object Support:** Seamless integration with GoogleMock for mocking interfaces and verifying interactions.

- **Event Listener API:** Customize test output and behavior by registering listeners to react to lifecycle events.

- **Test Execution Control:** Run subset of tests via filters, repeat tests, shuffle test order, support for running disabled tests, and test sharding for distributed testing.

- **Output and Reporting:** Generate detailed XML and JSON reports, color-coded console output, and options for streaming test results.

## Understanding Core Testing Macros

### TEST
Defines an independent test with a unique name within a test suite.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

### TEST_F
Defines a test using a test fixture class, allowing shared setup.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> queue_;
  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(1);
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsNotEmpty) {
  EXPECT_GT(queue_.size(), 0);
}
```

### TEST_P and INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P
Define and instantiate parameterized tests to run the same tests over various inputs.

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesRange) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(GetParam()));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(RangeTests, FooTest, testing::Range(1, 10));
```

### TYPED_TEST and TYPED_TEST_P
Write type-parameterized test logic to be reused across different types.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_ = static_cast<T>(0);
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, IsZeroInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, static_cast<TypeParam>(0));
}
```

### Death Tests
Validate that code terminates or asserts as expected to catch failure scenarios.

```cpp
TEST(FatalTest, Dies) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(SomeFunctionThatShouldFail(), "error message");
}
```

## Value and Typed Test Generators

GoogleTest provides sophisticated parameter generators for value-parameterized tests, allowing combinations, ranges, and container-based inputs through functions like:

- `Range(begin, end [, step])`
- `Values(...)`
- `ValuesIn(container)`
- `Bool()`
- `Combine(g1, g2, ..., gN)`

These can be transformed or customized with `ConvertGenerator` and custom name generators to produce meaningful, maintainable test invocations.

---

## Enhanced Test Execution Control

- **Filtering Tests:** Run a subset of tests matching complex wildcard expressions via `--gtest_filter`.

- **Running Disabled Tests:** Enable disabled tests with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

- **Repeating Tests:** Identify flaky tests by repeating test executions using `--gtest_repeat`.

- **Shuffling Tests:** Detect test interdependencies by randomizing test execution order with `--gtest_shuffle`.

- **Test Sharding:** Distribute test execution across machines using sharding environment variables.

- **Stop On Failure:** Fail fast behavior with `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop tests after the first failure.

---

## Reporting and Output Options

- **Console Output:** Color-coded test progress and results with concise or verbose modes.

- **XML and JSON Reports:** Generate structured reports for CI systems or further analysis.

- **Streaming:** Stream test results in real-time to remote servers.

- **Custom Event Listeners:** Extend or replace test output formats and add integrations via a powerful event listener API.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use `EXPECT_*` for recoverable checks and `ASSERT_*` for blocking test flow when a condition is critical.

- Leverage test fixtures (`TEST_F`) for shared state across related tests.

- Exploit parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) for cleaner, data-driven testing without code duplication.

- Use death tests to verify correct failure handling.

- Create custom assertions for improved clarity and debugging.

- Name test suites and tests according to C++ naming conventions without underscores, enabling better filtering.

- Always call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` to set up the framework correctly.
