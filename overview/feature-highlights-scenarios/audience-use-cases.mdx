# Target Audience & Use Cases

## Who Benefits from GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock together provide a powerful combination for writing clear, maintainable, and robust automated tests in C++. This documentation helps you understand which roles and teams experience the greatest value from these tools, and how they fit into your software development and delivery workflows.

### Primary User Groups

- **Library Developers:**
  - Craft tests for core libraries and reusable components.
  - Verify API correctness across platforms.
  - Increase confidence when refactoring or optimizing.

- **Application Developers:**
  - Validate application logic with unit and integration tests.
  - Simulate complex or external dependencies using mocks.
  - Catch regressions early in the development cycle.

- **Open-Source Maintainers:**
  - Provide comprehensive test suites to incoming contributors.
  - Ensure consistent behavior through automated testing.
  - Use parameterized tests to cover diverse use cases.

- **CI/CD Engineers:**
  - Integrate GoogleTest/GoogleMock with build and CI systems,
  - Automate regression detection and test reporting.
  - Leverage event listeners and test filters for customized workflows.

## Typical Use Cases

GoogleTest and GoogleMock address a wide range of testing needs, supporting multiple scenarios with tailored features.

### 1. Regression Testing

Prevent bugs from slipping into your codebase by continuously running tests that verify existing functionality.

- Write focused tests that pinpoint regressions without ambiguity.
- Automatically run tests on changes locally and in CI.
- Benefit from rich failure messages to quickly identify defects.

### 2. API Contract Verification

Ensure that your interfaces behave as expected and that your public APIs remain consistent.

- Define tests grouped logically by test suites.
- Use assertions to validate return values, side effects, and exceptions.
- Leverage mock objects (GoogleMock) to simulate collaborators and check interactions.

### 3. Error-Handling Validation

Check that your code correctly handles failure modes and edge cases.

- Apply death tests to confirm that critical errors cause expected termination.
- Use mocks to simulate error conditions in dependencies.
- Validate fallback logic and recovery scenarios.

### 4. Parameterized and Data-Driven Testing

Test a variety of inputs systematically with parameterized tests to increase coverage without duplicating code.

- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to define flexible, reusable test patterns.
- Generate comprehensive test suites that explore ranges, combinations, and container values.
- Custom name your test cases to maintain clarity during execution and reporting.

### 5. Integration into Complex Development Workflows

- Combine with build tools like CMake and Bazel for automated test discovery and execution.
- Automate tests in CI/CD pipelines with filtered execution, repeat runs, and sharding.
- Extend GoogleTest with event listeners to adapt reporting or trigger auxiliary actions.

## Before and After Using GoogleTest and GoogleMock

| Aspect                    | Before                                              | After                                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Maintenance          | Large hand-written test duplication and fragility. | Tests clearly organized with fixtures and parameterization. |
| Mocking Dependencies      | Manual stubs or complex scaffolding.                | Declarative mocks with automated verification and rich matchers. |
| Test Execution            | Manual invocation, hard to isolate failures.        | Automated discovery, filtering, and repeatable execution.  |
| Debugging Failures        | Vague output and crash logs.                         | Detailed assertions with contextual test traces.           |
| CI/CD Integration         | Complex scripting and brittle automation.            | Seamless integration and consistent reporting formats.     |

## Real-World Scenarios

### Library Author
You maintain a core utility library used by multiple teams. Using GoogleTest, you write parameterized tests to verify your algorithms across different inputs and edge cases. GoogleMock helps you validate callbacks and interactions with collaborators without requiring full implementations.

### Application Developer
Working on a service application, you write tests with `TEST_F` using fixtures to share expensive setup and teardown. You simulate network failures by mocking dependencies, validating your error handling paths. Your tests run automatically on each code push via the CI pipeline.

### Open-Source Maintainer
Your public library accepts contributions worldwide. Your comprehensive GoogleTest suite documents behavioral contracts for maintainers and contributors. You use event listeners to integrate test results with your monitoring dashboards.

### CI/CD Engineer
You automate test execution for multiple platforms using CMake and Bazel, leveraging GoogleTest's filtering and test sharding. You configure your pipelines to stop on the first failure or to run disabled tests selectively. Your team benefits from rich JUnit XML reports emitted by GoogleTest.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Group related tests in suites and use fixtures for shared setup.
- Use parameterized tests to avoid duplication and cover more ground.
- Apply GoogleMock to isolate the unit under test by mocking collaborators.
- Leverage death tests to verify code abort scenarios.
- Use custom name generators for parameterized test clarity.
- Integrate with CI early to catch regressions timely.
- Regularly maintain and review tests to prevent bit rot.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Ensure tests are registered correctly by linking with `gtest_main` or providing a main function.
- Beware of using fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) in constructors or destructors.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to gracefully skip tests when preconditions are unmet.
- When tests fail intermittently, consider using `--gtest_repeat` to identify flakiness.
- Make sure mock expectations match actual interactions to avoid unexpected failures.
