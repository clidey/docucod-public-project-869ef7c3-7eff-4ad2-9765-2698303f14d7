# Sample Workflows & Use Cases

Discover how GoogleTest seamlessly supports a variety of testing workflows, from straightforward unit tests verifying isolated functionalities to complex integration test suites validating interactions between components. This guide walks you through realistic examples that reflect everyday testing scenarios involving continuous testing loops, error handling verification, parameterized test execution, and more â€” equipping you to apply GoogleTest immediately and effectively.

---

## Exploring Simple Unit Testing Workflow

### Objective
Create and run a basic unit test to verify an isolated function or class behavior.

### User Journey
1. **Define a test case** focusing on specific function/class behavior.
2. **Write assertions** that express expected outcomes.
3. **Run the test** locally or in CI to validate correctness.

### Example
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

TEST(SampleTestSuite, AddAddsNumbersCorrectly) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(-1, 1), 0);
}
```

*Outcome:* Tests confirm method correctness quickly and report failures precisely.

---

## Continuous Testing for Early Defect Detection

### Objective
Integrate GoogleTest into automated pipelines that run tests upon changes, catching issues early.

### User Journey
1. Write targeted tests to exercise critical code paths.
2. Configure continuous integration (CI) pipelines to run tests on push or pull request.
3. Analyze test results to verify code quality.

### Realistic Scenario
- After pushing code, the CI server triggers `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` (typically via `testing::InitGoogleTest()` + `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`).
- Failed tests provide actionable failure messages, including file, line, and assertion details.
- Developers iterate confidently, reducing defects before merging.

*Tip:* See [Integrating with Continuous Integration (CI)](/guides/integration-and-best-practices/ci-integration) for setup guidance.

## Advanced Verification: Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Objective
Test how your code handles errors or exceptional conditions using mocks and assertions.

### User Journey
1. Create mocks for collaborators that simulate error cases.
2. Set expectations on mocks about how they should be used or fail.
3. Write tests that verify application responds as intended.

### Example using GoogleMock
```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, GetData, (int id), ());
};

TEST(DatabaseClientTest, HandlesConnectionFailure) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect())
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(false));

  // Code under test calls Connect and handles failure gracefully.
}
```

*Benefit:* Verify error pathways without requiring real failing systems.

## Test Parameterization for Greater Coverage

### Objective
Use parameterized tests to run the same test logic over a range of input values.

### User Journey
1. Define parameterized tests in GoogleTest.
2. Specify the inputs or parameters.
3. Run to ensure all cases behave correctly.

### Sample Code
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenTests, IsEvenTest,
                         ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

*Result:* Confidently verify behavior spans wide data sets with concise code.

## Integration Testing Across Multiple Components

### Objective
Validate that multiple units work together as intended in an integrated environment.

### Workflow
1. Assemble components under test, possibly including real and mocked collaborators.
2. Write tests representing typical integration flows.
3. Run tests with GoogleTest's flexible runners and analyze results.

### Real-World Example
Testing an order processing pipeline involving payment, inventory, and notification subsystems. You might mock external payment gateways but exercise key flows end-to-end.

*Tip:* Use GoogleTest fixtures and test suite organization to manage complex dependencies. See [Using Test Fixtures for Reusable Setups](/guides/core-workflows/using-fixtures).

## Troubleshooting and Optimization

### Best Practices
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to gain insights on mock function calls and failures.
- Leverage sequences and cardinalities to enforce call order and frequency precisely.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` judiciously to avoid sticky expectations causing false failures.

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to set expectations before exercising mocks leads to undefined behavior.
- Overly strict expectations with order enforcement can make tests fragile; prefer partial orders if appropriate.
- Missing virtual destructors on interfaces can cause leaks and resource mismanagement.
