# Primary Use Cases & Sample Workflows

Explore real-world scenarios where GoogleTest elevates your testing strategy through streamlined unit testing, effective regression checks, support for multiple implementations, and smooth integration into diverse build environments. This page offers practical narratives that connect GoogleTest’s robust features directly with developers’ goals—demonstrating how to leverage its power efficiently in your workflows.

## Unlocking Core Developer Goals with GoogleTest

GoogleTest isn’t just a testing framework—it’s a productivity amplifier. Developers aim to write reliable, maintainable, and repeatable tests while keeping complexity manageable and iterating fast. This page shows you precisely how common objectives translate into concrete GoogleTest use cases.

### Why This Matters

Picture this: You have a complex codebase that evolves constantly. Without automated tests, changes can easily introduce regressions. Writing tests manually becomes a maintenance nightmare, especially when supporting multiple code paths or cross-platform environments. GoogleTest shines here by offering:

- **Automated and expressive unit tests** that verify functionality with minimal boilerplate.
- **Regression testing made easy** by grouping tests and running them on every change.
- **Framework support for diverse implementations** through parameterized and typed tests.
- **Flexible integration** with build systems and continuous integration workflows.

---

## Use Case 1: Unit Testing Made Simple

**Goal:** Verify discrete functions or classes behave as expected in isolation.

GoogleTest provides expressive assertions, clear test failures, and mocks (via GoogleMock) to isolate your units.

### Typical Workflow

1. **Define test cases** focusing on one behavior at a time.
2. **Write assertions** that check outputs and side effects.
3. **Use test fixtures** to share setup across related tests.
4. **Run tests frequently** during development to catch issues early.

### Practical Example

Testing a `Calculator` class’s `Add` method:

```cpp
TEST(CalculatorTest, AddsTwoNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);  // Check the sum is correct
}
```

> Running this suite regularly ensures your addition logic stays correct even as code evolves.

---

## Use Case 2: Regression Checks to Prevent Breakage

**Goal:** Detect unintended changes that break previously working code.

Change is inevitable; regression tests safeguard against bugs creeping in.

### How GoogleTest Helps

- **Batch numerous tests** logically grouped and discoverable automatically.
- **Run tests on CI triggers** for instant feedback.
- **Detail test failures with clear diagnostics** aiding swift fixes.

### Scenario

You refactor a parser yet want to confirm it still parses inputs correctly:

```cpp
TEST(ParserTest, ParsesValidInputs) {
  Parser parser;
  EXPECT_TRUE(parser.Parse("valid input"));
}
```

Repeated execution of this test provides a safety net.

---

## Use Case 3: Testing Multiple Implementations

**Goal:** Verify different subject implementations meet the same interface or spec.

GoogleTest supports type-parameterized and value-parameterized tests that let you write a test once, and apply it to multiple implementations automatically.

### Workflow Highlights

1. Define templates for your tests.
2. List the implementations.
3. GoogleTest instantiates tests for each type or value.

### Example

Suppose you have two stack implementations: `ArrayStack` and `ListStack`.

```cpp
template <typename StackType>
class StackTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  StackType stack_;
};

using Implementations = ::testing::Types<ArrayStack<int>, ListStack<int>>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(StackTest, Implementations);

TYPED_TEST(StackTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(this->stack_.IsEmpty());
}
```

> This pattern promotes test reuse and ensures consistency across variants.

---

## Use Case 4: Integration into Diverse Build Environments

**Goal:** Seamlessly incorporate tests in your existing build and CI systems.

GoogleTest is designed for compatibility and ease of integration:

- Supports **CMake**, **Bazel**, and other build tools.
- Provides **command-line flags** to control test selection and output.
- **Runs tests in parallel** to reduce feedback time.

### Developer Flow

1. Add GoogleTest targets to your build config.
2. Write tests and place them as build dependencies.
3. Run tests locally or as part of CI pipelines.
4. Analyze detailed output for failures.

For example, running all tests and getting XML output for CI consumption:

```bash
./your_tests --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Write focused tests**: One assertion per test case keeps failures easier to debug.
- **Use test fixtures** to reduce duplication and setup complexity.
- **Leverage parameterized tests** to cover multiple inputs or implementations succinctly.
- **Mock dependencies** when isolating units—GoogleMock offers rich mocking features.
- **Integrate early and often** into your build environment to catch issues as soon as they appear.
- **Manage test expectations carefully**; avoid over-specification for resilient tests.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- If a test isn’t run: ensure it’s discovered by verifying naming conventions.
- If tests are flaky: isolate dependencies, check for hidden state or race conditions.
- If mocks misbehave: check method signatures, virtual keyword presence, and mock configuration.
