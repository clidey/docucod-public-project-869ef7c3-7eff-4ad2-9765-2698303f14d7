# Core Feature Overview

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive suite of powerful features that streamline writing, organizing, and executing C++ tests with clarity and precision. This page presents a survey of the primary capabilities users rely on to achieve reliable, maintainable, and scalable test suites.

---

## Test Discovery and Organization

GoogleTest automatically discovers and organizes your tests, requiring minimal boilerplate. Simply define your tests using the provided macros, and GoogleTest handles collecting and running them.

- **Test Cases and Test Suites:** Group related tests with test cases (or test suites), enabling structured test organization.
- **Parameterized Tests:** Define tests once and run them against multiple input parameters, avoiding code duplication.
- **Typed Tests:** Write generic tests applicable to multiple types, facilitating type-based validation.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MyMathTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(4, Add(2, 2));
  EXPECT_NE(5, Multiply(2, 2));
}

class FizzBuzzTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FizzBuzzTest, HandlesMultiples) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsMultipleOfThreeOrFive(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Tests, FizzBuzzTest, ::testing::Values(3, 5, 15));
```


## Assertion Varieties

GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions that enable precise and expressive verification of expected behavior.

- **Standard Assertions:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_NE`, and more, for common comparisons and conditions.
- **User-Defined Assertions:** Create custom assertion macros or functions to deliver meaningful diagnostics tailored to your domain.
- **Death Tests:** Verify your code’s behavior when it terminates due to fatal errors or assertions.

**Example:**
```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));  // Fails test immediately if false
EXPECT_EQ(10, Factorial(5)); // Records failure but continues
```


## Test Execution Modes

GoogleTest empowers you with flexible control over how tests run and report results.

- **Test Filters:** Run a subset of tests via command line filtering.
- **Repeated Runs:** Execute tests multiple times to catch flaky behavior.
- **Shuffling:** Randomize test order to expose hidden dependencies.
- **Death Test Environment:** Supports running tests that are expected to cause process termination.

**Example:**
```
--gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*
--gtest_repeat=10
--gtest_shuffle
```


## Failure Reporting and Debugging

GoogleTest offers detailed failure reports that aid in quickly diagnosing issues.

- **Descriptive Messages:** Show expected vs actual values with contextual information.
- **Stack Traces:** Display call stacks on failures where supported.
- **Test Logs:** Optionally capture additional logs during test runs.


## Flexible Test Fixtures

To support setup and teardown semantics, GoogleTest provides test fixtures that allow you to share common test configuration.

- Use fixtures to initialize resources or pre-populate data used across multiple tests.
- Supports both simple and parameterized fixtures.


## Real-World Context

Picture a developer maintaining a large codebase who wants to avoid regressions when refactoring. Using parameterized tests, they write a single test that validates their core algorithm with diverse inputs. When bugs emerge, rich assertions and clear failure messages pinpoint the root cause rapidly. With death tests, they ensure error conditions abort gracefully. Tests run automatically in continuous integration environments, leveraging GoogleTest’s filtering and repetition options to ensure robustness.


## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_` assertions when you want tests to continue after failure; use `ASSERT_` when failure should halt the test immediately.
- Keep parameterized tests focused and concise to maximize reuse.
- Utilize test filters liberally during development to speed up feedback loops.
- Use death tests judiciously for error-handling scenarios that exit the program.
- Combine assertions with informative messages to clarify intent.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests Not Running:** Make sure `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros are used correctly; verify that your test functions are in the same binary and linked correctly.
- **Assertions Not Firing:** Ensure assertions are inside test bodies and not global scope.
- **Death Tests Failing Silently:** Check platform support and ensure `EXPECT_DEATH` macros are used properly.

## Getting Started Preview

To start using these core features:

1. Write your first test using the `TEST` macro.
2. Run your tests and observe output.
3. Gradually introduce fixtures and parameterized tests for more complex scenarios.
