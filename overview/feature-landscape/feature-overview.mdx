# Feature Overview

Explore the essential capabilities of GoogleTest that empower you to write robust, flexible, and expressive tests in C++. This overview highlights the diverse types of assertions, powerful parameterization techniques for tests, and key integration points including mocking utilities.

## Understanding the Landscape of GoogleTest Features

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive set of tools designed to address the varied needs of C++ testing. Whether you need fine-grained assertions, want to run multiple inputs through your tests, or create complex mock behaviors, this feature set has you covered.

### Core Feature Highlights

- **Rich Assertion Types:** Includes equality, inequality, floating-point comparisons, exception assertions, and death tests, giving you fine control to validate your code's behavior.

- **Parameterized Tests:** Write generic tests that run with different input values or types, avoiding code duplication and improving test coverage.

- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Extend parameterization to test template classes or functions across multiple types with ease.

- **Integration with GoogleMock:** Seamlessly mock interfaces with powerful matchers, actions, expectations, and strictness modes to verify interactions.

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Combine GoogleTest's parameterized tests with typed inputs to test functions with various complex scenarios.

## Deep Dive: Assertion Types

Assertions form the backbone of your test validations. GoogleTest offers a variety of assertion macros and functions to confirm your code behaves as expected.

- **Basic Assertions:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_NE`, `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`, etc., for checking equality, inequality, and boolean conditions.

- **Floating Point Assertions:** `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ` tailored for floating-point comparisons to handle rounding errors.

- **Exception Assertions:** `EXPECT_THROW`, `ASSERT_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW` to ensure exceptions are thrown or not thrown.

- **Death Tests:** Confirm that code causes program termination under certain conditions.

For detailed usage and examples, see the [Assertions Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/assertions.html).

## Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest's parameterization framework allows you to write tests that operate over a set of inputs or types, dramatically reducing redundant code.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

These tests accept a set of values as parameters and run the same test logic against each. For example:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, HandlesValues) {
  int val = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(val, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  PositiveNumbers, MyTest,
  ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 4));
```

*Benefits:*
- Write once, test with many inputs
- Easy to maintain and extend


### Type-Parameterized Tests

These tests help validate template code by running the test suite across various types.

```cpp
template <typename T> class TypedTest : public ::testing::Test { };
using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(TypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(TypedTest, WorksForAllTypes) {
  TypeParam value = 0;
  EXPECT_EQ(value, 0);
}
```

*Benefits:*
- Validate templates over multiple data types
- Ensure type safety and consistent logic

## Integration Points: Mocking and Advanced Features

GoogleTest tightly integrates with GoogleMock, providing a powerful and expressive mocking framework.

### Mocking Framework Highlights

- **Flexible Mock Class Definition:** Use `MOCK_METHOD` to easily generate mock methods.
- **Set Expectations:** `EXPECT_CALL` specifies which calls are expected, argument matchers, number of calls, and result behaviors.
- **On-Call Defaults:** You can set default behavior on mocks with `ON_CALL` for uninteresting calls.
- **Strictness Modes:** Easily toggle between nice (silent on uninteresting calls), naggy (warn on uninteresting calls), or strict (fail on uninteresting calls) mocks using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`.
- **Sequences and Partial Orders:** Control call order with `InSequence` or `After` clauses for complex interaction testing.

### Feature Integration Example

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int), ());
};

TEST(MockFooTest, HandlesCalls) {
  MockFoo mock;

  ON_CALL(mock, Bar).WillByDefault(Return(42));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5)).Times(1);

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Bar(5), 42);
}
```

## Why This Matters for You

By mastering these features, you gain:

- **Enhanced Test Expressiveness:** Write tests that align closer with your intent.
- **Increased Test Coverage:** Thoroughly validate your code against varied inputs and types.
- **Robust Interaction Testing:** Precisely verify collaboration between components.
- **Improved Maintenance:** Parameterized and typed tests reduce duplication and make tests easier to update.

Imagine testing a function that calculates discounts for different types of users and purchase amounts. Using parameterized and type-parameterized tests makes specifying wide input coverage effortless, increasing confidence with minimal overhead. Coupled with mocking, you can simulate external service calls without complex setup.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` for interactions you explicitly want to verify and `ON_CALL` to define default behavior without strict expectations.

- Leverage sequences (`InSequence`) for strict ordering tests but prefer partial ordering (`After`) for flexible interaction graphs.

- When writing parameterized tests, name your test cases clearly to reflect different parameter groups.

- Use `NiceMock` objects when uninteresting calls are common to suppress noisy warnings.

- Always clean up mock objects properly to trigger verification and avoid false positives.
