# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide for mastering the essential language of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page is your gateway to understanding key terms such as assertions, test fixtures, mocks, actions, matchers, cardinalities, and test cases. We focus on demystifying testing terminology to empower you to write expressive, readable, and maintainable tests.

## Why Understand Core Concepts & Terminology?

Imagine entering a new domain where words like _assertion_, _mock_, or _cardinality_ are everywhere but not clearly explained. This page clears the fog by turning those terms into practical tools in your testing toolkit. By grasping these concepts, you'll write tests that are not only correct but also easy to comprehend and evolve, saving time and frustration.

## Key Terms at a Glance

### Assertions
Assertions are your test’s checkpoints — conditions that must hold true for the test to pass. GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions to validate values, states, and outcomes within your tests. Using assertions effectively helps you pinpoint exactly where and why your tests fail.

### Test Fixtures
Think of test fixtures as the stage set before a play. They prepare the environment for your tests by providing setup and teardown logic that runs before and after each test. This allows you to write clean, DRY test code that focuses on the behavior you're verifying.

### Mocks
Mocks are special test doubles representing external dependencies or collaborators. GoogleMock facilitates defining mock classes and methods that track and verify how your code interacts with these dependencies, capturing calls, arguments, and sequences.

### Actions
Actions specify what a mocked method should do when called—for example, returning a value, throwing an exception, or invoking a callback. They enable precise control of mock behavior during tests, simulating real-world scenarios without relying on actual implementations.

### Matchers
Matchers define the criteria for method arguments that are expected or allowed in mock method calls. They let you specify flexible, readable expectations like "any value", "greater than 10", or "has specific property", making tests expressive without being brittle.

### Cardinalities
Cardinalities specify how many times you expect a mock method to be called. They support exact counts (`Exactly(n)`), ranges (`Between(m, n)`), and bounds (`AtLeast(n)`), ensuring your tests reflect proper usage patterns and catch unexpected call count deviations.

### Test Cases and Suites
In GoogleTest, test cases group related tests. A test suite is a collection of test cases that can be run together. Organizing tests this way clarifies test purposes and improves maintainability.

## Bringing It All Together: How These Concepts Empower You

When writing tests, you want to ensure that:

- Your program behaves correctly under different scenarios (`Assertions`).
- You set up consistent test conditions (`Test Fixtures`).
- You isolate your code from external dependencies that are costly or unreliable (`Mocks`).
- You precisely define how dependencies behave during testing (`Actions`).
- You describe the inputs your code expects to receive when interacting with dependencies (`Matchers`).
- You control and verify how often interactions occur (`Cardinalities`).

Mastering these terms ensures you craft tests that are reliable, flexible, and maintainable. For instance, using mocks with defined expectations can help you detect incorrect usage or missed calls immediately.

## Practical Example: Mocking a Turtle Interface

Consider a simple graphics program using a `Turtle` interface. Instead of relying on a real turtle that draws on-screen, you mock the turtle:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
};
```

You can then set expectations on `MockTurtle` methods:

```cpp
MockTurtle turtle;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));

Painter painter(&turtle);
EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
```

This means your code must call `PenDown()` at least once and must invoke `Forward` with 100. Tests that violate these expectations will fail, highlighting incorrect behavior.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Set expectations before exercising mocks:** GoogleMock requires you to define expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) before the mock functions are called for reliable verification.
- **Balance specificity and flexibility:** Avoid over-specifying matchers to prevent brittle tests; use wildcard `_` when argument values are irrelevant.
- **Leverage `ON_CALL` for default behaviors:** Use `ON_CALL` to set mock default behaviors without imposing call count expectations.
- **Use cardinalities to express intent:** Express expected call counts clearly using cardinalities like `Exactly`, `AtLeast`, and `AnyNumber`.
- **Avoid mocking classes you don’t own:** This reduces maintenance burden as changes in external classes may break your mocks.

## Troubleshooting Common Terminology Pitfalls

- **Confusing uninteresting and unexpected calls:** Uninteresting calls have no expectations and typically produce warnings; unexpected calls violate defined expectations and cause test failures.
- **Missing virtual destructors:** Ensure interfaces and base classes have virtual destructors to avoid undefined behavior in mocks.
- **Over- or under-specifying matchers or cardinalities:** Leads to test fragility or missed bugs.
