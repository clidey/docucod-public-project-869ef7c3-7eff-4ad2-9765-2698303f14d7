# Integration and Ecosystem Compatibility

Discover how GoogleMock seamlessly fits into your development environment and toolchain. This page explains the supported platforms, integration with popular build systems like CMake and Bazel, and how you can extend your workflow with complementary tools and IDE plugins. Learn the essential include files to add and how to properly initialize GoogleMock in your tests for smooth adoption.

## Supported Platforms and Environments

GoogleMock is designed for broad compatibility with a wide range of operating systems and hardware platforms. Whether you are targeting standard desktop environments, embedded systems, or specialized IoT devices, GoogleMock has you covered.

Supported platforms include:

- Major desktop OSes: Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD
- Embedded platforms: ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52 (with Arduino support)
- Cross-compilation environments supported through Bazel and CMake

This flexibility enables developers to use GoogleMock for unit testing across diverse hardware targets without sacrificing test reliability or features.


## Build System Compatibility

GoogleMock integrates smoothly with popular build systems, enabling effortless inclusion in your build and test process.

### CMake Integration

GoogleMock includes CMake build configurations that facilitate easy linking into your projects. Simply find the GoogleMock package and link it with your test targets. Example:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
find_package(GMock REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(my_test PRIVATE GMock::gmock_main)
```

This setup automatically handles dependencies, compiler flags, and linking order.

### Bazel Integration

Using Bazel, GoogleMock is available as part of the `@com_google_googletest` repository. You can add gmock as a dependency in your `BUILD` files:

```python
cc_test(
    name = "my_test",
    srcs = ["my_test.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main"],
)
```

Bazel ensures isolated, reproducible builds and test runs.

### Additional Build Systems

GoogleMock also builds with other systems like Makefiles or Visual Studio projects. The key is to correctly include the necessary headers and link libraries.


## Extension: Related Tools and IDE Plugins

Enhance your GoogleMock experience by integrating it with tools and IDE extensions that boost productivity:

- **GoogleTest Plugin for IDEs**: Supports running and debugging tests with GoogleMock
- **Coverage Tools**: Combine with coverage analyzers to verify test completeness
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Ensure mock usage correctness and catch common pitfalls

These integrations help maintain high code quality and accelerate test-driven development.


## Integration Entry Points

To begin using GoogleMock in your project, focus on these key integration points:

### Recommended Include File

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
```

This single header includes all of GoogleMockâ€™s capabilities:

- Mock class macros (`MOCK_METHOD`)
- Matchers and actions
- Default mocking behaviors

Including `gmock/gmock.h` ensures you have all the necessary declarations and utilities ready for mocking.


### Test Initialization

Proper setup is critical for GoogleMock to function correctly, as it initializes both GoogleMock and GoogleTest frameworks.

Use one of the following initialization functions in your test `main()` or setup routine:

```cpp
// Standard main() initialization with command-line args
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

For Windows UNICODE builds:

```cpp
int main(int argc, wchar_t** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

For embedded or Arduino platforms without argc/argv:

```cpp
testing::InitGoogleMock();
```

The initialization parses command-line flags related to GoogleMock and GoogleTest, removes them from `argv`, and prepares the frameworks.

**Tip:** Avoid calling `testing::InitGoogleTest()` separately, as `InitGoogleMock()` initializes GoogleTest as well.


## Practical Integration Flow

1. **Include Headers**

   Include `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test source files.

2. **Link Libraries**

   Configure your build system to link against `gmock` and `gmock_main` libraries.

3. **Initialize Framework**

   Call `testing::InitGoogleMock()` early in `main()`.

4. **Write Tests**

   Write mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros, set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`, then run tests.

5. **Run and Debug**

   Use your preferred IDE or test runner integrated with GoogleMock/GoogleTest.


## Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Linker Errors?** Ensure you are linking `gmock` and `gmock_main` libraries properly; missing `gmock_main` often causes `main()` linkage issues.

- **Include Only What's Needed:** Prefer including `gmock/gmock.h` instead of individual headers to avoid missing dependencies.

- **Initialization Order:** Always call `testing::InitGoogleMock()` before calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

- **Unicode Builds:** Use the correct `InitGoogleMock` overload if your project uses wide-character arguments.

- **Embedded Systems:** On boards like ESP32 or NRF52, implement `setup()` and `loop()` using provided examples and call `testing::InitGoogleMock()` without parameters.

- **Build System Configurations:** Leverage provided CMake targets or Bazel dependencies for hassle-free integration.


## Summary

GoogleMock integrates effortlessly across a variety of platforms and build systems. Central to this integration are the inclusive header `<gmock/gmock.h>`, the versatile `InitGoogleMock` initialization method, and growth-friendly support for popular build tools like CMake and Bazel. Carefully following these integration steps ensures a robust, maintainable setup.
