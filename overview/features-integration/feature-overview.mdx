# Feature Overview

## Comprehensive xUnit Structure

GoogleTest implements an intuitive, xUnit-based testing framework that helps C++ developers write organized, maintainable tests. At its core, this framework treats tests as individual entities grouped into test suites, providing clear separation and categorization for complex projects.

- **Test Suites and Tests**: Users define *test suites* as containers grouping related tests. Each *test* within a suite is an independent unit of verification.
- **Automatic Test Discovery**: GoogleTest automatically discovers all defined tests when executing, eliminating the need for manual enumeration.

This structure promotes clarity and empowers developers to maintain large test bases efficiently.

## Rich Assertions for Thorough Verification

Assertions form GoogleTest’s foundation for validating code correctness. The framework supplies a broad set of assertions tailored to different verification needs:

- **Boolean Assertions**: Check simple true/false conditions.
- **Equality Assertions**: Compare values with macros like `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_EQ`.
- **String and Floating-Point Assertions**: Specialized macros simplify checks involving strings and floating-point numbers.
- **Custom Predicate Support**: Users can write predicates returning detailed `AssertionResult` objects for granular, descriptive feedback.

### Example: Custom Predicate
```cpp
// Checks if n is even, providing a descriptive message on failure.
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if ((n % 2) == 0)
    return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else
    return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(NumberTest, EvenCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(3));  // Will print: "Value of: IsEven(3) ... Actual: false (3 is odd)"
}
```

This flexibility enables users to tailor test feedback for better debugging.

## User-Defined Assertions for Enhanced Testing

Beyond built-in macros, GoogleTest supports user-defined assertions and value printers:

- **Value Printers**: The framework can print built-in and custom types via `AbslStringify()` or `PrintTo()`, making failures easier to interpret.
- **RecordProperty Logging**: Tests can log custom key-value pairs (`RecordProperty`) that become part of XML output, enabling richer test metadata.

## Death Tests: Validating Program Failures Safely

GoogleTest supports *death tests*, which assert that specific code causes process termination or abnormal exit:

- Run in subprocesses to isolate failures and protect test stability.
- Use macros like `ASSERT_DEATH()` to verify death conditions and stderr output.
- Provide different styles, including "threadsafe" execution for safer multithreaded death tests.

For example:
```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, CheckCrash) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({ DangerousFunction(); }, "expected error message");
}
```

This capability is crucial for testing failure handling in critical code.

## Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest goes beyond basic test cases by enabling *parameterized* and *typed* testing, fostering broad test coverage with minimal duplication.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

- Define test fixtures inheriting from `TestWithParam<T>`.
- Write tests with `TEST_P()` that use parameters via `GetParam()`.
- Instantiate with a parameter generator via `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`, e.g., `Values()`, `Range()`, or `Combine()`.

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, IsPositive) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(RangeTests, FooTest, testing::Range(1, 5));
```

This runs the test `IsPositive` for values 1 through 4, greatly improving automation.

### Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests

- Typed tests allow executing the same test logic across a set of types.
- Define a template test fixture, declare which types to test with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()`, and write test bodies with `TYPED_TEST()`.
- Type-parameterized tests enable decoupling test definition from instantiation.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test { ... };

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, DoesStuff) {
  TypeParam val = TypeParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(val, val);
}
```

This approach streamlines testing for multiple implementations or concepts.

## Versatile Test Runners and Output

GoogleTest features robust runners with flexible configuration and output customization:

- **Command Line Flags**: Control test selection, output formats, shuffling, repeats, and debugging aids.
- **Output Formats**: Choose between rich Colorized Console, XML, or JSON output for integration with CI systems.
- **Sharding and Repetition**: Support for distributing tests across machines and repeating tests to detect flakiness.
- **Event Listener API**: Extend or customize output by handling test lifecycle events.

### Example: Running with Filters and XML Output
```shell
./my_test --gtest_filter=MySuite.* --gtest_output=xml:results.xml
```

This runs only tests in `MySuite` and generates a detailed XML report.

## Summary and Recommended Next Steps

GoogleTest invites C++ developers to leverage its powerful, flexible framework to write robust tests efficiently. Start with writing simple tests using `TEST()`, then explore fixtures (`TEST_F()`). Gradually advance to parameterized tests and death tests as your coverage needs grow.

For a complete learning journey, consider these next steps:

- [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md): Get started with basic tests, assertions, and test fixtures.
- [Advanced GoogleTest](advanced.md): Develop mastery over parameterized tests, custom assertions, event listeners, and death tests.
- [Test Reference](reference/testing.md): Understand detailed macros and test registration.
- [Samples](samples.md): See working example tests to guide your own.

You may also want to customize test reporting by creating event listeners, or integrate GoogleTest with your existing build and CI environment.
