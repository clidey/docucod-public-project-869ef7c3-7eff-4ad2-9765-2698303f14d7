# Key Features at a Glance

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive set of features tailored to streamline and elevate your C++ testing experience. This page provides a concise yet powerful overview of its main capabilities, enabling you to quickly determine how GoogleTest aligns with your project requirements.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically finds and registers your tests without requiring manual listing or configuration. Simply define test cases using macros, and the framework detects them at runtime, allowing seamless and scalable test management.

**Why it matters:**
- No boilerplate to register tests
- Supports large and modular codebases
- Simplifies continuous integration

---

## Versatile Assertion Library

Expressive and rich assertions form the core of GoogleTest’s ability to verify correctness. From simple equality checks to complex predicate evaluations, GoogleTest’s assertion macros give you precise control over validation.

**Key benefits:**
- Clear, human-readable failure messages
- Assertions that work for almost any C++ type
- Integration with matchers for flexible argument checks

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
ASSERT_TRUE(IsValid(value));
EXPECT_THAT(container, ::testing::Contains(42));
```

---

## User-Defined Matchers

Extend GoogleTest with custom matchers that capture domain-specific validation logic. Matchers let you write assertions that feel natural and strongly express the intent of your tests.

**Value for you:**
- Increase test expressiveness and readability
- Reuse common validation logic across tests
- Reduce chances of brittle, over-specified checks

You can define matchers quickly using macros such as `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, or implement matcher classes for full control.

---

## Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

Create one test template and run it with multiple input values or types to cover broad scenarios efficiently. GoogleTest supports:
- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same logic with various parameters.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same tests for different data types.

Example:
```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};
TEST_P(MyTest, HandlesValues) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(Process(param));
}
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Values, MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This approach dramatically reduces test code duplication while ensuring correctness across diverse inputs.

---

## Fatal and Non-Fatal Failures

GoogleTest distinguishes between fatal (`ASSERT_`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_`) failures to give you finer control:
- **Fatal Failures** stop execution of the current test, useful to abort when prerequisites fail.
- **Non-Fatal Failures** allow the test to continue, providing comprehensive feedback from a single run.

This enables balanced test designs where you can combine strict preconditions with broader verification.

---

## Sophisticated Mocking with GoogleMock

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with GoogleMock, a powerful mocking framework offering:

- Declarative syntax for defining mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros
- Ability to mock normal classes, class templates, overloaded functions, and even non-virtual methods
- Rich set of matchers to specify intricate expectations on method arguments
- Control over invocation counts with cardinalities like `Times()`, `AtLeast()`, `AnyNumber()`, etc.
- Order control of mock calls via `InSequence()` and `After()` clauses
- Default action specifications using `ON_CALL()` for setting behavior of uninteresting calls
- Strictness modes - `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock` (default), and `StrictMock` to fine-tune treatment of unexpected or uninteresting calls

Example:
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Process, (int count), (override));
};

using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

MockFoo mock;
ON_CALL(mock, GetSize()).WillByDefault(Return(5));
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_)).Times(AtLeast(1));

// Your test code exercises mock here.
```

This mocking capability transforms testing of complex interactions and dependencies into a straightforward, maintainable process.

## Quickly Assess Applicability

This summary helps you decide if GoogleTest fits your project by highlighting:

- How GoogleTest discovers and organizes tests effortlessly
- The breadth and flexibility of assertions and matchers empowering precise validation
- Support for advanced test structuring via parameterization
- Controlled failure handling to improve test diagnostics
- Deep integration with GoogleMock enabling sophisticated mocking strategies

<Tip>
For hands-on guidance, proceed to the [Getting Started with GoogleMock](/guides/mocking-advanced/getting-started-mocking) page where basic mock setup, expectations, and usage patterns are explained step-by-step.
</Tip>

<Note>
Remember that to fully leverage mocking features, you should have a clear interface design with virtual methods. For challenging cases like mocking non-virtual or static functions, consider design adjustments as explained in the [gMock Cookbook](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html#mocking_non_virtual_methods).
</Note>

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

**Tips for success:**
- Define mock methods in the `public` section regardless of original access levels to enable expectations and default actions
- Use `NiceMock` during development to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls, switching to `StrictMock` for stringent error detection
- Set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) before exercising the mocks to ensure accurate verification
- Avoid over-specifying expectations; use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and only set expectations on interactions you intend to verify

**Common pitfalls:**
- Forgetting virtual destructors in interfaces can lead to undefined behavior
- Mismatched argument types in matchers cause test failures or unexpected call mismatches
- Defining too many expectations without `RetiresOnSaturation()` can cause interaction conflicts

For advanced scenarios, consult the [Mocking Reference](/docs/reference/mocking.md) and [Legacy gMock FAQ](docs/gmock_faq.md) for solutions to frequently reported issues.
