# Core Features at a Glance

Unlock the full potential of GoogleTest with a tour of its most powerful and widely used features. This page serves as your quick-reference guide to the automated test discovery, versatile assertion macros, flexible mocking capabilities powered by GoogleMock, and advanced testing features like parameterized and death tests. Whether you are writing simple unit tests or constructing complex test scenarios, this overview maps key functionalities to their implementation files for easy navigation and deeper exploration.

## Automated Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest makes running all your defined tests effortless, automatically discovering them without the need for manual enumeration or registration.

- **Auto-registration**: Tests defined with `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and typed test macros register themselves automatically.
- **Centralized Execution**: Invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` once to execute every test registered, across all test suites and source files.
- **Isolation**: Each test runs independently under its own fixture instance, promoting clean, repeatable test outcomes.

**Key File:** [`src/gtest.cc`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/src/gtest.cc)

## Comprehensive Assertion Suite

Assertions are the backbone of verifying code correctness. GoogleTest provides a rich variety of macros that allow precise and expressive validation.

- **Fatal vs Nonfatal Assertions**: Use `ASSERT_*` to stop test execution immediately upon failure, or `EXPECT_*` to continue and gather multiple failures.
- **Wide Range of Checks**: From simple boolean checks to equality, string comparison, floating-point verifications, exception testing, and predicate-based assertions.
- **Custom Failure Messages**: Stream additional context directly into assertions for clearer diagnostics.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(VectorTest, SizeEquality) {
  std::vector<int> a = {1, 2, 3};
  std::vector<int> b = {1, 2, 3};
  ASSERT_EQ(a.size(), b.size()) << "Vectors differ in length";
}
```

## Flexible Mocking with GoogleMock

GoogleMock extends your testing power by letting you simulate complex dependencies through mock objects.

- **Declarative Mock Syntax**: Define mock methods succinctly using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- **Expectation Setting**: Specify call expectations via `EXPECT_CALL` with argument matchers for precise control over interactions.
- **Control Behavior**: Define what mocks return or do when methods are called using `WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`, or `WillByDefault`.
- **Partial Mocks**: Support hybrid objects combining real and mock implementations.
- **Sequence and Ordering**: Express call order constraints with sequences and the `InSequence` or `After` clauses.
- **Mock Strictness**: Choose between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control sensitivity to unexpected calls.

Example:

```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& uri), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetUserCount, (), (const));
};

TEST(UserServiceTest, ConnectsToDatabase) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("db://localhost"))
      .WillOnce(Return(true));

  // Code that uses mock_db...
}
```

**Key Files:**
- [`src/gmock-all.cc`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/src/gmock-all.cc)
- [`include/gmock/gmock.h`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googlemock/include/gmock/gmock.h)

## Support for Death Tests

Death tests verify that your program terminates under expected error conditions, such as invalid input or fatal assertions.

- **Special Macros**: Use `ASSERT_DEATH` and `EXPECT_DEATH` to validate that code blocks cause the program to exit or abort.
- **Flexible Verification**: Check both the exit status and output printed to `stderr`.
- **Thread-Safe Styles**: Choose between "fast" and "threadsafe" death test styles to balance safety and speed.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FatalTest, DeathOnNull) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(
    Foo(nullptr), "Null pointer passed to Foo");
}
```

**Key File:** [`src/gtest-death-test.cc`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/src/gtest-death-test.cc)

---

## Parameterized and Typed Testing

Save effort and boost coverage by running the same test logic over multiple inputs and types.

- **Value-Parameterized Tests**: Write a single test pattern to run over a series of values using `TEST_P` and instantiate with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests**: Repeat test logic across different C++ types using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`.
- **Abstract and Reusable Tests**: Define parameterized tests once and instantiate in multiple places, supporting interface conformance checks.

Example:

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroAndPositive) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GE(Factorial(n), 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveNumbers, FactorialTest, testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 8));
```

**Key File:** [`include/gtest/gtest-param-test.h`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/gtest-param-test.h)

---

## Configurable Test Execution

Control how your tests run to suit debugging, scaling, and continuous integration workflows.

- **Test Filtering**: Run specific subsets of tests with `--gtest_filter`.
- **Repeated Runs**: Find flaky tests via `--gtest_repeat`.
- **Test Sharding**: Distribute tests across multiple machines using environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`.
- **TODO and Disabled Tests**: Temporarily disable tests with `DISABLED_` prefix without removing them from builds.
- **XML and JSON Reporting**: Generate detailed reports of test results for CI integration.

Example Command:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MathTest* --gtest_repeat=10
```

**Key File:** [`src/gtest.cc`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/src/gtest.cc)
