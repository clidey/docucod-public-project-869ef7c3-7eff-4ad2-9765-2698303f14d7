# Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed and maintained with a commitment to broad C++ compatibility that aligns with Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). This ensures that the framework runs smoothly across major operating systems and compilers commonly used in modern C++ development.

---

## What This Means For You

Whether you are developing on Linux, Windows, or macOS, GoogleTest aims to support your environment with minimal friction. Compatibility extends not only to operating systems but also to the compilers and build tools you choose, providing you with a stable and consistent testing framework regardless of your toolchain setup.

## Supported Compilers, Platforms, and Build Tools

GoogleTest relies on the comprehensive compatibility matrix maintained by Google, which outlines currently supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build tools. This matrix ensures that the framework prioritizes support for environments that receive active maintenance and meet modern C++ standards.

For a detailed and up-to-date list of supported platforms, compilers, and versions, please refer to this [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).


## Why You Should Care

Selecting a testing framework that aligns with your development environment avoids common pitfalls caused by unsupported compiler features or platform quirks. GoogleTest's adherence to this support policy guarantees:

- **Portability:** Write tests that compile and run on your preferred platform without platform-specific hacks.
- **Reliability:** Avoid unexpected build or runtime errors caused by unsupported toolchains.
- **Longevity:** Benefit from ongoing support as your project's dependencies and environment evolve.

## Practical Tips

- Before integrating GoogleTest, verify that your compiler and platform versions are listed in the support matrix.
- If you are targeting a less common environment, review the matrix carefully to assess potential compatibility issues.
- Use the support policy as a guideline for upgrading your toolchain to maintain compatibility.

## Common Pitfalls

- Attempting to use GoogleTest with deprecated or unsupported compiler versions may lead to build failures.
- Some embedded or niche platforms may lack full support, so always check the matrix before assuming compatibility.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup title="Common Questions About Platform Support">
<Accordion title="Why is GoogleTest’s support based on the Google Foundational C++ Support Policy?">
This policy ensures the testing framework stays compatible with environments actively supported by Google, guaranteeing stable and reliable operation across a wide range of modern development setups.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if my platform or compiler isn’t listed?">
GoogleTest may still build on some unsupported platforms, but issues may arise. For critical projects, consider upgrading to a supported version or reaching out to the community for guidance.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are all versions of Windows supported?">
GoogleTest supports mainstream desktop and server versions via MSVC and MinGW. Mobile or embedded Windows variants typically lack full support.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does platform support include multi-threaded test execution?">
Support varies depending on pthread availability and platform thread safety. When building, GoogleTest detects these capabilities automatically or can be configured manually.
