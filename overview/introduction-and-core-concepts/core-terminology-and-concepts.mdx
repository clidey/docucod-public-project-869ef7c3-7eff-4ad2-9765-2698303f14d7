# Core Concepts & Terminology

Familiarize yourself with foundational terms like *xUnit*, *assertions*, *fixtures*, *death tests*, and *parameterized tests*. This page provides concise, user-friendly definitions and explains how they underpin both test authoring and execution in GoogleTest.

## Understanding Core Terms in GoogleTest

GoogleTest and its companion library GoogleMock rely on key concepts that help you effectively write, organize, and execute tests. Clarifying these foundational terms empowers you to seamlessly apply the framework to your projects.

### 1. xUnit

xUnit is a general testing framework design pattern that GoogleTest follows. The name originated from the earliest such framework called JUnit for Java. It revolves around organizing tests into **test cases** (logical groups of related tests) and **test methods** or **test functions** (individual test implementations).

- **Why it matters:** It fosters a standard and systematic approach to unit testing.

### 2. Assertions

Assertions are statements that verify conditions or values in tests and automatically fail tests when expectations aren't met.

- Examples:
  - `EXPECT_EQ()` asserts that two values are equal but allows the test to continue on failure.
  - `ASSERT_TRUE()` checks that a condition is true and aborts the current test on failure.

- **Benefit:** Assertions let you confirm your code behaves as expected and immediately spot errors.

### 3. Fixtures

Fixtures are user-defined test classes that help you share setup and teardown code across related tests.

- You create a fixture by subclassing `testing::Test` and overriding the `SetUp()` / `TearDown()` methods.
- Tests that use the fixture share common test state and resources for cleaner, DRY test code.

### 4. Death Tests

Death tests verify that your code responds correctly to fatal errors or must terminate under certain conditions.

- They are tests that expect the program to crash, raise a fatal signal, or call `exit()`.
- GoogleTest provides `EXPECT_DEATH()` macros to execute such tests safely.

- **Use Case:** Validating error handling logic and defensive programming.

### 5. Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests enable testing the same logic against different input values or types, reducing duplication.

- They allow concise expression of multiple similar tests using templates or test parameter data.
- GoogleTest supports value-parameterized tests (varying input values) and type-parameterized tests (varying types).

- **Example:** Testing that a sorting algorithm sorts arrays of different sizes and types.

## How These Terms Enable Effective Testing

Each of these concepts forms a pillar in how you author and execute tests:

- **xUnit** organizes tests for understanding and maintenance.
- **Assertions** concretely verify correctness.
- **Fixtures** manage reusable states and resources to avoid boilerplate.
- **Death tests** catch undesirable failure modes.
- **Parameterized tests** scale your coverage without bloating your code.

Together, they elevate your ability to write clear, robust, maintainable tests that thoroughly exercise your code.

## Related Concepts in GoogleMock

GoogleMock builds on these test core ideas and introduces mocks, matchers, and actions to verify interactions and behaviors:

- **Expectations:** Define how many times and in what ways mock methods should be called.
- **Matchers:** Specify argument constraints for method calls.
- **Actions:** Define what mocked methods do when invoked (e.g., return a value, invoke a callback).

Explore the [gMock Cheat Sheet](../../../api_reference/mocking_and_expectations/creating_mock_objects.md) and [Actions Reference](../../../api_reference/core_testing_apis/actions_reference.md) to deepen your understanding.

## Practical Tips

- **Start simple:** Focus on writing clear assertions and simple test cases.
- **Use fixtures:** When you observe duplication of setup code, create a fixture.
- **Think about ordering:** Use parameterized tests for varying inputs instead of copying similar tests.
- **Death tests:** Guard with platform macros if you need cross-platform compatibility.
- **Combine mocks and tests:** Use GoogleMock to complement your GoogleTest assertions, verifying both state and interaction.
