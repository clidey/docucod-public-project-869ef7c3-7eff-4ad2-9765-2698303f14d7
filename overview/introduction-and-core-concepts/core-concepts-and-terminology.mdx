# Key Concepts and Testing Terminology

Learn essential testing terms as they relate to GoogleTest—such as test cases, test suites, test fixtures, assertions, expectations, and mocks. Build foundational knowledge to interpret tests and documentation effectively.

## Introduction: Understanding the Language of GoogleTest

Before diving into writing tests or reading test code, it's important to master the core terminology used in GoogleTest. These concepts form the building blocks for creating, organizing, and interpreting tests. Knowing what these terms mean will greatly enhance your productivity and reduce confusion.

### Why Terminology Matters

Imagine you are collaborating on a large C++ project. You receive a test report stating that a "test case failed." Is it a single assertion that failed? Is it a group of related tests? Misunderstanding terms such as "test suite" and "test fixture" can quickly lead to wasted time and miscommunication.

GoogleTest uses certain terms in ways that might differ from other testing communities or standards like ISTQB. This page will clarify these terms and explain how they fit into GoogleTest's architecture.

## Core GoogleTest Terminology

### Tests

A **Test** in GoogleTest is a function that verifies one aspect or path of your code. Tests typically contain one or more **assertions** — checks that verify specific conditions about your code's state or output.

Tests are the fundamental units of verification. When a test runs, it can succeed, fail due to a failed assertion, or be aborted due to a fatal failure.

#### Example
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```
Here, `HandlesZeroInput` is a test verifying that calling `Factorial` with zero produces 1.

---

### Test Suites

A **Test Suite** is a collection of related tests. It's the level where tests are grouped logically, often mirroring the structure or components of the code under test. This grouping helps organize tests and can facilitate shared setup or teardown logic via fixtures.

This term may cause confusion: GoogleTest historically used **Test Case** to mean what is now called **Test Suite**. To align with modern standards, GoogleTest is moving toward using "Test Suite" exclusively.

#### Example
In the above snippet, both tests mentioned belong to the `FactorialTest` test suite:
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) { ... }
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) { ... }
```

---

### Test Fixtures

A **Test Fixture** is a C++ class used when multiple tests need to share the same setup, data, or helper functions. It allows tests to reuse code and state easily.

When you use a test fixture, GoogleTest creates a fresh instance for each test, ensuring tests remain independent and do not interfere with each other.

#### Workflow
- Define a class derived from `testing::Test`, declare shared data members and setup/teardown methods.
- Use `TEST_F()` macros to define tests that operate with the fixture.

#### Example
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;

  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);  // Setup
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  auto* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

---

### Assertions

**Assertions** are statements in tests that check conditions — for example, whether a value equals what you expect or if a pointer is `nullptr`. Assertions determine test results: if an assertion fails, the test fails.

GoogleTest assertions come in two flavors:

- `ASSERT_*`: Failures here are **fatal** and abort the current test function immediately.
- `EXPECT_*`: Failures are **non-fatal**; test continues after the failure.

Using non-fatal (`EXPECT_`) assertions allows multiple problems to surface from a single test run, improving debugging efficiency.

#### Example
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(a, b) << "a and b must be equal";
EXPECT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "ptr should not be NULL";
```

---

### Expectations

While *assertions* verify program behavior inside tests, **expectations** pertain to behavior set on mocks — objects simulating real dependencies. Expectations define:

- Which mock methods are expected to be called.
- With what arguments.
- How many times.
- In what order.

Expectations serve as contracts between the test and its mocked collaborators.

Note that this page focuses mostly on the general testing terminology; detailed mock-related concepts are covered in the mocking documentation.

---

### Mocks

**Mocks** are simulated objects implementing the interfaces of real components, used to verify interactions and isolate tests.

GoogleTest integrates closely with the GoogleMock (gMock) framework for mocking. Mocks allow you to:

- Define mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Set expectations on method calls.
- Check that your code under test interacts correctly with its dependencies.

## Terminology Comparison: GoogleTest vs ISTQB

| Meaning                                                 | GoogleTest Term | ISTQB Equivalent |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Single verification of a program path with input/output | Test           | Test Case        |
| Grouping of related tests                               | Test Suite     | Test Suite       |

GoogleTest has recognized the confusion caused by previous use of "Test Case" to mean what is now standardized as "Test Suite". Recent versions prefer `TestSuite` in APIs.

---

## How These Pieces Fit Together

1. **Assertions** verify conditions inside individual **tests**.
2. Related tests are organized into **test suites**.
3. Tests in the same suite can share a **test fixture** class for common setup/teardown.
4. The entire test program can consist of multiple test suites.
5. When using mocks, expectations define expected **interactions** between code and mocks.

This structure helps keep tests independent, maintainable, and scalable.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Name your test suites and tests carefully.** Follow C++ naming conventions and avoid underscores in test names. Clear names improve readability and navigation.

- **Use test fixtures to avoid duplication.** If multiple tests share data or setup, encapsulate it into a fixture.

- **Prefer non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) assertions for multiple checks.** Use `ASSERT_*` only when continuing after failure risks crashes.

- **Group logically related tests together** in a test suite for clear test organization.

- **Be mindful of the semantic differences between test terminology.** When collaborating, clarify terminology use to avoid confusion.

- **Refer to the GoogleMock documentation** to learn how mocks and expectations augment your tests beyond basic assertions.

## Summary

Mastering GoogleTest's terminology empowers you to write better tests, read test suites with clarity, and communicate effectively with your team.

With this foundation, you can confidently dive into writing tests, using assertions, sharing data via fixtures, and structuring your test suite to align with the code architecture.

## Next Steps

- Begin writing your own tests using the `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros.
- Explore assertions to verify behavior effectively.
- Experiment with test fixtures to manage shared test resources.
- When your tests depend on interactions with external components, learn about mocking via GoogleMock.
- Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to run and verify your tests.
