# Supported Platforms & Target Audience

Welcome to the key reference for GoogleTest's supported platforms and target audience. This page helps you quickly determine whether GoogleTest fits your development environment and if it's the right tool for your testing needs—from solo developers experimenting locally to large distributed teams managing enterprise-grade projects.

## Why This Matters

Choosing a testing framework hinges on compatibility and suitability. Understanding which platforms, compilers, and build tools GoogleTest supports ensures a smooth integration into your workflow. Additionally, knowing who benefits most from GoogleTest helps you decide whether it aligns with your team's goals and scale.

## Supported Platforms, Compilers, & Build Environments

GoogleTest adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to guarantee broad compatibility and reliability across environments.

### Platform Compatibility Highlights
- **Operating Systems:** GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms, including Linux, Windows (Desktop and variants), Mac OS X, and several Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, and more.
- **Mobile & Embedded Devices:** It explicitly supports platforms like iOS and Android but offers limited support for specialized embedded systems.
- **Platform Detection:** The framework auto-detects target platforms using built-in macros, minimizing manual configuration.

### Compiler & Language Standards
- **C++ Standard:** Requires an environment supporting at least C++17 to build successfully.
- **Compilers Supported:** Modern versions of GCC, Clang, MSVC, Intel, and other standard compilers on supported platforms.
- **Build Tools:** Supports cross-platform building primarily through [CMake](https://cmake.org/), enabling integration with native build environments such as Makefiles on Linux/macOS, Visual Studio on Windows, and Xcode on Mac.

### Build System Integration
The recommended and most straightforward way to build and integrate GoogleTest is with CMake:

- **Standalone Build:** Clone the GoogleTest repository, create a build directory, and generate build scripts via `cmake ..`.
- **Embedding in Your Project:** You can link to GoogleTest libraries via `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` or incorporate GoogleTest as a subdirectory using `add_subdirectory()` to ensure consistent compiler and linker settings.
- **Special Build Configurations:** Supports building GoogleTest as a shared library (DLL on Windows) by defining macros like `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` and adjusting linker flags accordingly.

### Platform-Specific Details & Tweaks
- **Thread Safety:** GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support but may require manual setting of macros like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` to force detection.
- **Macro Conflicts:** If macros like `TEST`, `ASSERT_EQ`, etc., conflict with your code, GoogleTest allows renaming through macros such as `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1` to avoid these collisions.
- **Runtime Compatibility:** On Windows, you can toggle CRT linkage modes (dynamic vs static runtime) using `gtest_force_shared_crt` to prevent runtime conflicts.

<Tip>
Incorporating GoogleTest through CMake ensures that you benefit from its wide platform support while simplifying build management across development, testing, and continuous integration environments.

## Who Benefits Most from GoogleTest?

GoogleTest serves a diverse audience with a unified goal: improving the quality and reliability of C++ software through testing.

### Ideal Users
- **Individual Developers & Small Teams:** Rapid setup and minimal configuration make GoogleTest perfect for personal projects and small teams requiring fast feedback.
- **Open Source Projects:** Its portability and permissive license foster collaborative development and reproducible testing across community contributions.
- **Enterprise & Large-Scale Teams:** GoogleTest’s robust feature set, integration flexibility, and multi-platform support enable large teams to maintain complex test suites across varied environments.

### User Profiles & Scenarios
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Teams targeting multiple OSes (Windows, Linux, macOS) need a framework that behaves consistently; GoogleTest fulfills this need.
- **Continuous Integration Pipelines:** Automated test discovery and command-line flag configuration support seamless integration into CI tools.
- **Legacy and Modern Codebases:** Supports projects with or without exceptions, RTTI, or different compiler quirks, catering to both modern and legacy C++ code.

### Common Benefits Experienced by Users
- Improved test reliability via independent, repeatable tests.
- Faster debugging with detailed failure information and isolated test execution.
- Consolidation of testing across diverse environments without rewriting tests.

<Note>
GoogleTest’s design assumes users possess a C++17-capable environment and basic familiarity with C++ build systems. Understanding these prerequisites accelerates your success in leveraging the framework.

## Getting Started Preview

Here is what your initial experience with GoogleTest's platforms and build environment looks like:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Environment Compatibility">
Ensure your development environment is running a supported OS and that you have a modern C++17 compiler and build tools installed.
</Step>
<Step title="Download and Prepare GoogleTest">
Clone or download the GoogleTest repository from GitHub to your local machine.
</Step>
<Step title="Build Using CMake">

Execute the following commands in your terminal to build GoogleTest standalone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b v1.17.0
cd googletest
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

Alternatively, integrate it directly into your existing project’s CMake setup.
</Step>
<Step title="Start Writing Tests">
Use GoogleTest’s macros and assertions to create test suites that are portable across your supported platforms.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
GoogleTest requires C++17 or later due to language features and dependencies.
</Check>
