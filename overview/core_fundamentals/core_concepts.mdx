# Core Testing Concepts

## Master the Building Blocks of GoogleTest

GoogleTest structures your testing code around several key concepts: tests, test cases (test suites), assertions, fixtures, and test runners. This page breaks down these essential components, explaining how they interrelate and how they shape your testing workflow for clearer, more reliable results.

---

## Understanding the Fundamentals

### Tests and Test Suites

- **Tests**: The fundamental units of verification. Each test verifies some behavior or output of your code. GoogleTest defines tests using the `TEST()` macro, which combines *test suite name* (sometimes called test case) and *test name*.
- **Test Suites**: Groups of related tests logically organized under one umbrella. Sharing a test suite name links tests related to specific functionality or a component.

### What You Achieve

- Ensure your code behaves as expected for diverse inputs by writing multiple individual tests.
- Organize your tests clearly so that failures trace back easily to related features.

> "Think of test suites as folders and tests as files inside — grouping and isolating tests is key to maintainability."

### Running the Tests

Tests are automatically discovered and registered at compile time. You trigger their execution with the `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` function, typically from your `main()` function, which runs every test and provides an aggregate pass/fail status.

---

## Writing Tests: Macros and Syntax

GoogleTest offers multiple macros to declare tests, each suiting a particular use case:

- **`TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`**: Defines a simple test without shared setup.

  ```cpp
  TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
    EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
  }
  ```

- **`TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`**: Defines a test using a test fixture (shared setup and teardown).

- **`TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`**: For value-parameterized tests (running the same test logic with multiple inputs).

### Rules of Naming

- Test suite and test names must be valid C++ identifiers without underscores (`_`) to avoid internal naming conflicts.
- Test names within the same suite must be unique.

---

## Assertions: The Heart of Verification

Assertions define the conditions your code should meet during test execution. GoogleTest provides two main types:

- **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: Aborts the current test function on failure.
- **Non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: Records failure but allows the test to continue.

Examples:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));
ASSERT_EQ(Factorial(4), 24) << "Factorial calculation failed!";
```

### Common Assertions Include

- Equality: `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_EQ`
- Boolean conditions: `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`
- String comparisons: `EXPECT_STREQ`, etc.
- Exception checks: `EXPECT_THROW`, `ASSERT_NO_THROW`

### Best Practices

* Use `EXPECT_*` when you want to see all failures within a test.
* Use `ASSERT_*` if it makes no sense to continue after failure (e.g., null pointer checks).

## Test Fixtures: Reusing Setup and Teardown

To avoid duplicating common setup code for multiple tests, GoogleTest provides **test fixtures** — classes derived from `testing::Test` that hold shared data and setup logic.

### How It Works

1. Define a fixture class with member variables and `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` methods.
2. Write tests using `TEST_F()` macro with the fixture class.
3. GoogleTest constructs a new fixture object per test, calls `SetUp()`, runs the test, calls `TearDown()`, and then deletes the object.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    shared_resource = new Resource();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    delete shared_resource;
  }

  Resource* shared_resource;
};

TEST_F(FooTest, DoesX) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_resource->Check());
}
```

## Test Runner Lifecycle

GoogleTest manages the full lifecycle of tests including:

- Discovering tests at compile time.
- Running tests in order.
- Handling test suite setup (`SetUpTestSuite()`) and teardown (`TearDownTestSuite()`).
- Running each test with fresh fixture objects to ensure independence.
- Aggregating results for reporting.

You interact with the runner primarily by calling:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

The framework ensures test isolation, repeatability, and robust reporting.

  A --> H[Test Runner] --> I[Runs all tests]
```

## Tips & Pitfalls

- Avoid sharing state between tests without proper synchronization; tests should remain independent.
- Always check the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in `main()` to correctly propagate test success or failure.
- Prefer fixtures when multiple tests require the same environment; this improves maintainability.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context when debugging failures inside helper functions.
- Remember that each test gets a fresh fixture object: do not assume state persists between tests.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="Test Name Collision or Underscores Usage">
Using underscores in test suite or test names can produce confusing errors or misnaming internally. Stick to plain alphanumeric names without underscores.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Assertion Usage in Non-Void Functions">
Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) can only be safely used in functions returning `void`. Using them elsewhere causes compilation errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fixture Setup Not Called">
Ensure you override `SetUp()` with the correct capitalization and use `override` to catch mistakes. Mis-spelling as `Setup()` prevents GoogleTest from calling it.
</Accordion>

## Next Steps

To begin applying these concepts:

- Write your first basic test using the `TEST()` macro.
- Explore test fixtures and how `TEST_F()` enables shared setup.
- Learn to write assertions and interpret failure messages.
- Consult [Writing Your First Test](../getting-started/first-test-and-validation/writing-your-first-test) for hands-on examples.
