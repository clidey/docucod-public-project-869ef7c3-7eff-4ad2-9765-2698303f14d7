# Feature Highlights

Discover the essential features that make GoogleTest a powerful, reliable, and flexible C++ testing framework. This guide walks you through the key functionalities that drive efficient unit testing and mocking with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, enabling you to write expressive and maintainable tests.

---

## Core Features at a Glance

- **xUnit Architecture**: Leverage a familiar, structured framework for organizing tests into test cases with clear lifecycle management.
- **Automatic Test Discovery**: Run your tests with no manual registration, as GoogleTest automatically discovers tests across your codebase.
- **Rich Assertion Library**: Use a comprehensive set of assertions, including death tests for crash scenarios and exception assertions, to validate behavior precisely.
- **User-Defined Assertions**: Extend default assertions with custom logic tailored to your specific domain and needs.
- **Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests**: Write tests that run with multiple data inputs or across different types, making your tests concise but thorough.
- **Advanced Test Execution Controls**: Manage the order, repetition, and conditional execution of tests to suit complex workflows.

## Understanding GoogleTest's Core Features

### 1. xUnit Test Architecture

GoogleTest follows the widely recognized xUnit design model where tests are organized into suites (test cases) and individual tests.

- **Test Cases & Tests**: Group related tests under test cases.
- **Test Fixtures**: Set up shared objects and clean them up automatically before and after each test.

This architecture empowers you to write structured, isolated tests focusing on one aspect at a time.

### 2. Automatic Test Discovery

Forget the hustle of manually registering tests. GoogleTest automatically finds all tests defined using its macros:

```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, MyTest) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}
```

Run your test binary, and all such tests execute without additional setup.

### 3. Rich Assertion Library

GoogleTest provides expressive assertions that check conditions in your code and report clear failures:

- **Basic Assertions** like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE` for validating test results.
- **Death Tests**: Verify your program crashes as expected in certain situations.
- **Exception Assertions**: Check for throws or lack thereof.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(MyFunction(), std::runtime_error);
ASSERT_DEATH(CrashFunction(), "error message");
```

### 4. User-Defined Assertions

You can craft custom assertions to encapsulate complex validations, improving readability and reuse:

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsValidUser(const User& user) {
  if (user.id <= 0) {
    return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << "Invalid user id";
  }
  return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
}

EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsValidUser, user);
```

### 5. Parameterized & Type-Parameterized Tests

Run the same test logic with multiple input values or for different types without code duplication.

- **Value Parameterized Tests** use input values supplied as parameters.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests** run for different types as templates.

This leads to extensive validation with less code.

### 6. Advanced Test Execution Controls

Control test execution finely with features like:

- Specifying exact number of times a test should run
- Ordering tests using sequences and dependencies
- Conditional execution and test filters

By combining these controls, you customize test flows to your project’s needs.

## GoogleMock Feature Highlights

GoogleMock integrates seamlessly with GoogleTest to offer comprehensive mocking capabilities:

- Declarative syntax for defining mocks via `MOCK_METHOD`
- Automatic verification of expectations without a separate record/replay phase
- Intuitive and flexible controls over the behavior and order of mock method calls
- Rich matchers for argument validation and custom matchers for domain-specific needs
- Support for nice, naggy, and strict mock objects to regulate how uninteresting calls are handled
- Easy delegation to real objects or fakes, enabling hybrid test doubles

Example:

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(MyTest, UsesMock) {
  MockFoo foo;
  ON_CALL(foo, GetSize()).WillByDefault(Return(42));
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, GetSize()).Times(1);
  ASSERT_EQ(foo.GetSize(), 42);
}
```

## Why These Features Matter

GoogleTest’s core features ensure that:

- Writing tests is fast and intuitive, reducing learning curves.
- Tests are reliable, reproduce failures consistently, and provide detailed diagnostics.
- Complex testing scenarios involving different inputs or interactions can be expressed straightforwardly.
- Tests remain maintainable and scalable as projects grow.
- Mock objects enable precise interaction testing, isolating components and improving design.

By mastering these features, you’ll gain full mastery over test construction and validation.

## Quick Start Preview

To harness these features quickly:

1. Start with a simple test using `TEST` and basic assertions.
2. Explore automatic test discovery by compiling and running your test binary.
3. Use parameterized tests to cover multiple input cases succinctly.
4. Define mocks with `MOCK_METHOD` in your test classes.
5. Set expectations via `EXPECT_CALL`, customize behavior with `ON_CALL`.

For detailed examples and best practices, proceed to the [Common Use Cases & Workflows](../common_use_cases.md) page.


<Note>
Remember: Start simple, then layer on complexity. Use assertions to convey intent clearly. Use mocks to focus on interactions. Avoid over-specifying expectations to maintain test resilience.
