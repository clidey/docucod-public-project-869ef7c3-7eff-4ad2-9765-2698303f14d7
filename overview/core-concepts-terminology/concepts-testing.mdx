# Testing: Key Concepts

GoogleTest provides a powerful, flexible framework to write, organize, and execute C++ tests. This page introduces essential testing concepts that form the foundation of writing effective tests with GoogleTest. You will learn about test cases, test fixtures, assertions, parameterized and typed tests, and the role of the test runner.

## Core Concepts of Testing in GoogleTest

### What Is a Test Case (Test Suite)?

A test case, also called a *test suite*, is a logical grouping of related tests. It usually corresponds to a class, module, or feature you want to verify. Grouping tests maintains organization and enables shared setup and teardown through test fixtures.

- Each test case contains multiple individual tests that check specific behaviors.
- Test case names provide context about what code or feature the tests cover.

### What Is a Test?

An individual *test* is a function designed to verify one aspect or behavior of the code. Each test:

- Has a unique name within its test case.
- Contains assertions that verify expected outcomes.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, AddTwoPlusTwo) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 2), 4);
}
```

Here, `MathTest` is the test case, and `AddTwoPlusTwo` is the individual test.

### Test Fixtures: Sharing Setup and Cleanup

Test fixtures allow sharing common setup and teardown code for tests within the same test case. This makes your tests cleaner, avoids duplication, and ensures consistent test environments.

- A fixture is implemented as a C++ class derived from `testing::Test`.
- You define setup by overriding `SetUp()`, and cleanup by overriding `TearDown()`.
- Use the `TEST_F` macro to write tests that use the fixture.

Example:
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }
  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryReturnsResults) {
  auto result = db.Query("SELECT * FROM table");
  EXPECT_FALSE(result.empty());
}
```

### Assertions: Verifying Behavior

Assertions are statements that check if a condition holds. They determine whether a test passes or fails. GoogleTest offers:

- **Fatal assertions** (`ASSERT_*`): Fail the test and abort the current function immediately.
- **Non-fatal assertions** (`EXPECT_*`): Report failure but allow test execution to continue.

You use the correct assertion based on whether it is safe or meaningful to continue after failure.

Common assertion types include:

- Boolean checks: `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`
- Equality/Inequality: `EXPECT_EQ(value1, value2)`, `ASSERT_NE(value1, value2)`
- String comparisons
- Floating point comparisons

Example:
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(vec.size(), expected_size) << "Vector size mismatch!";
EXPECT_TRUE(Process(input));
```

### Fatal vs Non-fatal Assertions

- Use **fatal assertions** when a failure prevents further meaningful test progress.
- Use **non-fatal assertions** to collect multiple failures within a single test run.

### Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test logic multiple times, each with different input values, improving coverage without duplicating code.

- Define parameterized fixtures by inheriting from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the parameter type.
- Use `TEST_P` to write the parameterized test.
- Instantiate them with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`, supplying a set or generator of parameters.

Example:
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesFactorial) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(Factorial(n), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, FactorialTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 4));
```

Each test runs with one of the values `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

### Typed Tests

Typed tests let you run the same test logic across different data types.

- Define a template fixture class inheriting from `testing::Test`.
- Associate a list of types using the `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` macro.
- Write test cases with `TYPED_TEST` using `TypeParam` to refer to the type.

Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value{0};
};

using NumericTypes = testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, DefaultValueIsZero) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value, TypeParam(0));
}
```

This test runs three times, once per type.

### The Test Runner

GoogleTest automates test discovery and execution.

- Tests register automatically with the framework.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` runs all registered tests, manages setup, teardown, and result reporting.
- You can filter tests to run specific subsets.

Example main function:
```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Always use `ASSERT_*` when subsequent test code depends on the assertion.
- Use fixtures to avoid duplicated setup/teardown code.
- Use parameterized or typed tests to cover variations without code duplication.
- Name your test cases and tests clearly and consistently.
- Avoid test dependencies; tests should be independent and repeatable.

## Summary

This page explained the fundamental concepts for testing with GoogleTest including the structure and purpose of test cases, tests, test fixtures, assertions, parameterized, and typed tests. It also introduced the test runner lifecycle.

For hands-on examples and deeper understanding, sample projects under `googletest/samples` demonstrate practical usage of these concepts.
