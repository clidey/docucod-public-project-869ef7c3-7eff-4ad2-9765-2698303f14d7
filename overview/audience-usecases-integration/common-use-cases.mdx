# Common Use Cases

Explore typical scenarios where GoogleTest excels, demonstrating its power in unit testing C++ code, regression validation, cross-platform assurance, CI/CD workflows, and complex mocking for large codebases. This page presents real-world case studies and practical insights that reflect GoogleTest's broad applicability and adaptability.

## Unit Testing C++ Libraries and Projects

GoogleTest is the go-to framework for comprehensive unit testing in C++. It helps developers isolate individual components and verify their correctness precisely and repeatedly.

### Scenario: Testing Mathematical Utilities

Imagine you have a complex mathematical library with classes and functions performing matrix operations. Using GoogleTest, you can:

- Write test cases that invoke matrix addition, multiplication, and inversion.
- Use assertions to verify that matrix elements match expected values after operations.
- Easily run tests repeatedly to catch regressions early.

**Benefits:**
- Ensures correctness of low-level components.
- Facilitates refactoring without risking functionality.
- Supports writing Maintainable and readable test suites.


## Regression Testing for Continuous Quality

GoogleTest enables building regression test suites that automatically verify all previously fixed bugs stay fixed.

### Scenario: Legacy Code Stabilization

For a large existing system with known bugs:

- Write tests that replicate the bugs using GoogleTest.
- Incorporate these tests into your CI pipeline.
- Guarantee that fixing one bug doesn't break others.

**Benefits:**
- Detects unintended side-effects of code changes.
- Builds confidence in legacy code maintenance.
- Saves debugging time by identifying breakages early.


## Platform-Agnostic Testing and Cross-Platform Development

GoogleTest supports multiple platforms and compilers, making it ideal for projects that target diverse environments.

### Scenario: Cross-Platform Networking Library

Deploy and test your networking code consistently across Windows, Linux, and macOS by:

- Writing portable test cases.
- Verifying that network protocols behave identically.
- Using GoogleTest's command-line options to filter tests by platform or feature.

**Benefits:**
- Helps identify platform-specific bugs early.
- Simplifies maintaining a single test suite for multiple targets.
- Supports compiler-specific differences with ease.


## CI/CD Integration for Automated Testing

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with common CI/CD pipelines ensuring high code quality through automated testing.

### Scenario: Continuous Integration in a Large Team

- Automatically run GoogleTest test suites after every code commit.
- Capture detailed test reports including passed, failed, and skipped tests.
- Trigger alerts on failures to enable timely fixes.

**Benefits:**
- Accelerates feedback loops.
- Decreases risk of regression bugs.
- Promotes collaboration with transparent quality metrics.


## Advanced Mocking for Complex, Large Codebases

GoogleMock, bundled with GoogleTest, provides powerful mocking capabilities to simulate and verify interactions in complex component graphs.

### Scenario: Testing a Payment Processing System

- Mock external payment gateways to simulate network failures or erroneous responses.
- Set expectations on how your code calls these gateways using `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Use custom matchers to verify call arguments.
- Control mock behavior tightly with `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()`.

**Benefits:**
- Makes testing integration points without real dependencies safe, fast, and repeatable.
- Enables behavior verification, not just state verification.
- Supports strict control on call order, argument matching, and frequency.

## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Open-Source Graphics Project
- Migrated from manual tests to GoogleTest.
- Reduced test execution time by 40%.
- Improved bug detection rate in rendering modules.

### Case Study 2: Enterprise Cloud Service
- Leveraged GoogleMock to mock distributed services.
- Built complex interaction tests with ordered sequences.
- Integrated tests fully into Jenkins CI, increasing deployment confidence.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Start small: write tests for core, critical components before expanding.
- Use mocks to isolate dependencies and improve test stability.
- Employ sequences and cardinalities to model expected call orders and counts.
- Regularly run tests locally and in CI to catch regressions.


## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and How To Tackle Them">
<Accordion title="Tests Passing Locally but Failing in CI">
Often caused by environment differences or missing dependencies. Verify the setup scripts and run tests with verbose flags like `--gtest_verbose=info`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Expectations Not Being Met">
Check the exact matchers and call sequences. Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls and understand mismatches.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow Test Execution">
Identify tests causing bottlenecks and refactor to use mocks or fixtures that reduce expensive resource usage.
