# Feature Highlights

GoogleTest empowers C++ developers with a comprehensive suite of features tailored to ease the rigorous task of testing robust applications. This page provides a concise overview of GoogleTest’s key capabilities—including test discovery, a powerful assertion library, parameterized and typed tests, mocking facilities, and flexible test runners—that collectively address modern C++ testing challenges.

---

## Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs tests, eliminating tedious manual test suite maintenance. By simply writing tests using its rich macros, users can run all their tests with minimal configuration.

- Tests are organized by test cases and test names, simplifying grouping and reporting.
- Supports run filtering to selectively execute tests by name patterns.
- Provides integration-friendly test executables that fit into build and CI workflows.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```
When executing your test binary, all such tests are discovered and run.

## Rich Assertion Library

Beyond basic equality, GoogleTest offers expressive, readable assertions that help precisely verify program behavior:

- Assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_THROW`, and many specialized forms.
- Support for equality comparison, floating-point comparisons with tolerances, string comparisons, container comparisons.
- Integration with powerful matchers enhances flexibility to write clear, intention-revealing tests.

**User Benefit:**
Clear assertion failures provide detailed diagnostics immediately, accelerating root cause analysis.

## Parameterized and Typed Testing

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests enabling the same test logic to run with varying inputs, increasing test coverage without duplication:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run a test with different values supplied at runtime.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Run a test over a set of types, helpful for template-heavy code.
- Both forms support defining setup/teardown and can be combined with fixtures.

**Example of Value-Parameterized Test:**
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

**Why It Matters:**
This approach eliminates repetition and fosters robust testing of behaviors under diverse conditions.

## Mocking Support via GoogleMock

GoogleTest includes GoogleMock, a powerful mocking framework:

- Provides macros like `MOCK_METHOD` to generate mock implementations of interfaces effortlessly.
- Supports setting precise expectations on mock object methods using `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Supports argument matchers, sequence ordering, multiple expectations, and default behaviors (`ON_CALL`).
- Allows strictness controls with `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` wrappers.
- Facilitates interaction testing, crucial for verifying collaboration among components.

**Scenario:**
Imagine testing a class that interacts with a hardware controller. Instead of the actual hardware, GoogleMock lets you simulate the controller behavior and verify interaction sequences and data passed.

---

## Flexible Test Runners

GoogleTest’s test runners cater to diverse user needs:

- Runs tests serially or in parallel;
- Supports custom event listeners to tailor test output formatting or integrate with IDEs and CI systems;
- Facilitates death tests to validate program termination scenarios safely.

Users can configure runners via command-line flags or programmatically for repeatable and automated workflows.
