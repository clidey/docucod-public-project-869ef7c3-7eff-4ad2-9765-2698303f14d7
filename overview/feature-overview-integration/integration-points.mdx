# Integration & Ecosystem

Understand how GoogleTest fits into your workflow: supported platforms and compilers, integration with CI/build systems (like CMake and Bazel), and examples of adoption in open-source and enterprise environments.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest is designed to integrate seamlessly into a wide range of development environments and build systems, making it easy to adopt in your existing workflows. This page helps you understand where and how you can use GoogleTest effectively.

---

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest supports the major desktop and server platforms commonly used in C++ development:

- **Operating Systems:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Compilers:** GCC, Clang, MSVC

This broad support ensures that your tests remain portable across platforms and development environments.

> GoogleTest aims to provide consistent behavior regardless of where your code is running, empowering your cross-platform development efforts.

---

## Build System Integration

GoogleTest comes with built-in support and guidance for popular C++ build systems, facilitating straightforward integration:

### CMake

GoogleTest's official source repository contains ready-to-use CMake scripts to:

- Discover and build test targets.
- Link GoogleTest libraries as dependencies.
- Enable test discovery within CMake-generated test runners.

This allows you to add GoogleTest with minimal configuration.

### Bazel

If you use Bazel as your build system, GoogleTest provides Bazel BUILD files compatible with its structure. You can directly depend on GoogleTest targets and run tests with Bazel's native test runner.

> Leveraging GoogleTest's CMake or Bazel integration ensures your tests build correctly, execute efficiently, and integrate with your continuous integration pipelines.

---

## Continuous Integration (CI) Support

GoogleTest works well in all CI environments, thanks to:

- **Automated Test Discovery:** Runs all tests automatically without manual enumeration.
- **Rich Test Reporting:** Returns detailed exit codes and output logs compatible with popular CI systems.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Same test binaries run on different platforms without modification.

This makes GoogleTest ideal for inclusion in your CI pipelines—whether on Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or other systems.

---

## Adoption in Open-Source and Enterprise Environments

GoogleTest is widely adopted and battle-tested:

- Many open-source C++ projects use GoogleTest as their standard testing framework.
- Enterprises rely on GoogleTest for high-quality, maintainable unit tests across diverse codebases.

Its extensive ecosystem and robust documentation reflect its maturity and reliability.

## Practical Examples

Here are practical snippets illustrating integration points:

### CMake Example

```cmake
# Add GoogleTest as a subdirectory
add_subdirectory(googletest)

# Define your test executable
add_executable(my_tests test_main.cc my_tests.cc)

# Link with GoogleTest libraries
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest_main)

# Enable testing
enable_testing()

# Register the tests
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_tests)
```

### Bazel Example

```starlark
load("@com_google_googletest//:bazel/mock.bzl", "gmock")

gmock(
    name = "my_tests",
    srcs = ["my_tests.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main"],
)
```

> These examples can be used as templates or starting points for your build configuration.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Nice or Strict Mocks Appropriately:** Depending on your test's needs, toggle mock strictness modes ([see Strictness Modes documentation](../api-reference/core-mocking-apis/strictness-modes)).
- **Separate Mock Classes:** Maintain mock class definitions adjacent to the interfaces they mock for ease of maintenance and clearer ownership.
- **Use ON_CALL and EXPECT_CALL Judiciously:** Set default behaviors with `ON_CALL` and verification expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` ([see Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md)).

---

## Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls

- **Build Failures:** Make sure your build system paths and compiler configurations point correctly to GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers and binaries.
- **Linking Errors:** Verify library linking order and visibility of mock classes.
- **Test Discovery Issues:** Ensure tests use the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros and that the test binary is correctly registered with your build/test system.

For additional help, refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../../getting-started/troubleshooting-help/common-issues) page.

## Next Steps

- To integrate GoogleTest in your projects, start with the [System Requirements](../../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) and [Project Setup & Configuration](../../getting-started/configuration-first-use/project-setup).
- For details on writing tests, see [Write and Run Your First Test](../../getting-started/configuration-first-use/write-and-run-first-test).
- For advanced mocking details, consult the [Mocking Reference](../docs/reference/mocking.md) and [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md).
