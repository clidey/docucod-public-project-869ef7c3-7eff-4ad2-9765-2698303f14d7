# Glossary of Key Terms

## Introduction
This glossary clarifies the foundational concepts and terminology used throughout GoogleTest. Understanding these terms is essential to writing effective tests, organizing test code, utilizing mocking, and interpreting test results.

---

## Test
A **Test** is an individual verification unit in GoogleTest. It is a function-like entity defined using the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros, which exercises a small piece of your code to confirm it behaves as expected.

- **Test Suites** group related tests for organization and shared setup.
- A test succeeds if all its assertions pass and fails otherwise.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

---

## Test Suite
A **Test Suite** is a collection of related tests, logically grouped under a shared name and often sharing common setup/teardown operations.

- Defined implicitly by giving all tests in the group the same first parameter to `TEST()` or by defining a fixture class used with `TEST_F()`.
- Helps organize tests and apply common resource management via fixtures.

---

## Test Fixture
A **Test Fixture** is a C++ class derived from `testing::Test` used to set up and clean up the environment shared by several related tests within a test suite.

- Provides member variables and subroutines for use by all tests using the fixture.
- Each test gets its own fresh instance of the fixture, ensuring test isolation.
- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for setup and cleanup logic.

**Example:**
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> q_;
  void SetUp() override { q_.Enqueue(1); }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(*q_.Dequeue(), 1);
}
```

---

## Assertion
An **Assertion** is a statement that checks a condition in a test and reports success or failure.

- GoogleTest provides macros such as `EXPECT_*` (non-fatal; test continues if fails) and `ASSERT_*` (fatal; aborts test on failure).
- Assertions verify code correctness: Boolean conditions, equality, exceptions, string matching, floating-point comparison, etc.
- Failure messages include source file and line number and help identify problems.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Optional user message";
```

For details, see the [Assertions Reference](../overview/core-concepts/assertions-and-matchers).

---

## Matcher
A **Matcher** describes a rule or condition used in assertions or mock expectations to specify which values are considered acceptable.

- Provides expressive ways to check arguments, e.g. `Eq(5)`, `Contains(substring)`, or complex combinations.
- Used with `EXPECT_THAT()` assertions or to specify mock method argument expectations.

---

## Mock Object
A **Mock Object** is a test double that simulates the behavior of real objects.

- Created using classes that inherit from a mock base class and use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to define mock methods.
- Used in unit tests to isolate the code under test by replacing dependencies with controlled behavior.

---

## Expectation
An **Expectation** specifies how a mock object's method is expected to be called during the test.

- Declared with `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Defines allowed argument patterns (via matchers), cardinality (how many times the method should be called), order constraints, and actions (what happens when called).

---

## Death Test
A **Death Test** checks that a program or function terminates in a specific way (e.g., due to a fatal error).

- Runs the statement in a subprocess so the main test isn't terminated.
- Useful for testing error handling and fatal conditions.
- Uses macros such as `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH`.

---

## Test Lifecycle Terms

- **SetUpTestSuite / TearDownTestSuite:** Static methods to set up and tear down shared resources once per test suite.
- **SetUp / TearDown:** Instance methods to set up and tear down resources before and after each individual test.
- **Skipped:** Tests that are marked to be excluded from execution.

---

## Value-Parameterized Test
A test type that runs the same test logic multiple times with different values.

- Defined using `TEST_P` and instantiated via `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Parameters accessed via `GetParam()`.

---

## Typed Test
A test type that runs the same test logic with multiple data types.

- Defined using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`.
- Useful for templated code testing.

---

## TestInfo
An object representing metadata and results about an individual test.

- Contains test suite name, test name, source file, line number, result status, and properties.

---

## TestResult
An object holding detailed outcome information about a test execution.

- Contains results of individual assertions, passed/failed/skipped status, timing data, and recorded properties.

---

## UnitTest
The singleton class representing the whole test program.

- Manages all test suites and tests.
- Responsible for running tests, maintaining listeners, and collecting global test results.

---

## Best Practices & Tips
- Use meaningful test names and suites reflecting code structure.
- Prefer test fixtures when tests share setup/teardown logic.
- Use `EXPECT_*` to allow a test to continue after failure, `ASSERT_*` to stop it as needed.
- Use parameterized tests to avoid duplicating test code.
- Isolate dependencies using mock objects with clear expectations.
- For death tests, understand they run in subprocesses with isolated state.
