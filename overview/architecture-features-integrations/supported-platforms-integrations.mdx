# Supported Platforms & Integrations

GoogleTest is designed to deliver reliable, portable, and efficient C++ testing across a wide range of environments. This page details the operating systems, compilers, and build tools officially supported by GoogleTest, alongside guidance on integrating with continuous integration (CI) workflows and popular integrated development environments (IDEs).

---

## Platform Support

GoogleTest follows Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring broad coverage of modern development environments while embracing industry standards for compiler and platform stability.

### Operating Systems

GoogleTest fully supports and is continuously tested on the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (multiple distributions and kernel versions)
- **Windows** (including Desktop, MinGW, Windows Store/WinRT apps)
- **macOS** (including support for iOS and related Apple platforms)

Partial or experimental support exists for several less common or embedded platforms, though stability in these environments may vary due to limited core team access.

### Compilers

To ensure modern C++ support and reliability, GoogleTest requires:

- **C++17 compliant compilers** or later

Commonly supported compilers include:

- GCC (version 7.0 and later)
- Clang (version 3.4 and later)
- Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) 2017 Update 3 (19.11) and later
- Intel C++ Compiler supporting C++17 features

Users must verify that the compiler is configured to enable C++17 or a newer standard to guarantee successful build and execution.

### Build Tools

GoogleTest supports multiple build systems with recommended and tested configurations:

- **CMake**
  - CMake 3.14 or later is recommended
  - GoogleTest provides CMake targets for easy inclusion
- **Make**
  - Supported on Unix-like systems
- **Visual Studio** (for Windows)
  - Visual Studio 2017 or newer projects can import GoogleTest

The framework also works smoothly with other build systems that can handle standard C++ compilation, including Bazel and Ninja.

## Continuous Integration & Test Automation Support

GoogleTest's design facilitates seamless integration with modern CI pipelines and testing infrastructures:

- **Exit codes reflect test results**, allowing automated systems to detect failures easily.
- **Stable command-line flags and APIs** enable filtering tests, controlling output verbosity, and managing parallelism.
- **Custom listeners and event listeners** allow tools like Jenkins, TeamCity, GitLab CI, and others to consume test events for richer reporting.

Users can incorporate GoogleTest into their CI workflows using typical CLI invocations:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=SuiteName.* --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

This triggers a targeted test run and produces an XML report consumable by many CI systems.

## IDE Integration & External Runners

GoogleTest enjoys excellent support in popular C++ IDEs, improving developer productivity:

- **Visual Studio** 
  - Built-in test explorer integration with GoogleTest adapter extensions
  - Debugging and test management support
- **CLion & JetBrains IDEs**
  - Native support for GoogleTest test discovery and execution
- **Eclipse CDT**
  - Supports GoogleTest plugin and test execution

Additionally, various external test runners and plugins exist for editors like VSCode, enhancing test writing, running, and debugging experiences.

## Best Practices for Platform Compatibility

* **Use approved compiler flags and build options** aligned with GoogleTest’s requirements (e.g., `-std=c++17`).
* **Define control macros** cautiously if tweaking GoogleTest for unsupported or unusual environments, see the macros in [gtest-port.h](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h).
* **Run tests in isolated CI environments** reflecting the target platform to catch platform-specific issues early.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Pitfalls

- **Incorrect compiler version**: Compile errors often arise if the compiler does not support C++17 or later.
- **Missing `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` flag on Linux when using pthreads**: Thread safety and related tests might fail.
- **Linker errors on Windows**: Ensure runtime libraries are consistent (see [CMake Visual Studio Dynamic vs Static Runtimes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md#visual-studio-dynamic-vs-static-runtimes)).

### How to Diagnose

- Use `testing::InitGoogleTest()` at the start of your test executable to parse flags and initialize properly.
- Run `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` once to ensure full test execution.
- Increase verbosity using flags like `--gtest_verbose=info` for clearer output.

## Getting Started with Supported Platforms

Leverage GoogleTest’s flexible build scripts (especially CMake) and start with the sample tests included in the source. Make sure to:

- Confirm your platform, compiler, and build tool versions meet the minimum requirements.
- Follow the [Installation and Build Instructions](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md) carefully.
- Employ CI integration best practices to maintain test reliability across environments.
