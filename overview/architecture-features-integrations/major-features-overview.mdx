# Major Features at a Glance

Welcome to a concise summary of the most powerful and essential features that GoogleTest offers. This page delivers a focused overview of GoogleTest’s major capabilities — from xUnit-style tests and automatic test discovery to rich assertions, parameterized tests, flexible test runners, death tests, and seamless mocking support — providing quick insight into why developers rely on it for robust C++ testing.

## Core Features at a Glance

### xUnit-Style Tests
GoogleTest embraces the familiar xUnit testing paradigm, making it intuitive for developers coming from other testing frameworks. By structuring tests into test cases (suites) and test functions, it helps organize your tests logically and clearly.

*Example use case:* Define a `CalculatorTest` test case containing multiple tests such as `Addition` and `Subtraction` to modularize your testing effort.

### Automatic Test Discovery
Forget tedious manual test registration. GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests in your codebase, streamlining your workflow and ensuring that no test is overlooked.

*User benefit:* Quickly add new tests without worrying about registering them; simply build and run.

### Rich Assertions
Expressive and detailed assertions allow you to verify complex conditions while producing clear diagnostic messages.

*Real-world scenario:* Use `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, or `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers to precisely assert expected behaviors and values.

### Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests
Run the same test logic with different inputs or types without duplicating code.

*Concrete example:* Test a sorting algorithm with multiple data sets using parameterized tests, or run the same test on different container types using type-parameterized tests.

### Death Tests
Validate that your code crashes or terminates under expected failure conditions, helping you ensure defensive programming.

*User walkthrough:* Write tests that expect your program to exit or throw under invalid input scenarios, enhancing reliability.

### Flexible Test Runners
Select how your tests execute — from running all tests, specific subsets, or filtered groups.

*Value:* This flexibility accelerates debugging by focusing only on tests relevant to your current task.

### Mocking Support (GoogleMock Integration)
Seamless integration with GoogleMock enables creation of mock objects for isolating dependencies and validating interactions.

*Benefits:* Easily specify how mock methods behave, set call expectations, use matchers for argument validation, and verify call sequences.
