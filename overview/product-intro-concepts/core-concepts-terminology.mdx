# Core Concepts & Testing Terminology

This page demystifies key testing concepts used throughout GoogleTest and GoogleMock, including test cases, assertions, matchers, test discovery, mocks, death tests, value- and type-parameterized tests, and test lifecycles. Clarify foundational terms to accelerate your onboarding.

## Understanding GoogleTest and GoogleMock Terminology

As you start using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, you will encounter a variety of terms that describe fundamental testing concepts. This page provides clear definitions and explanations of those terms, ensuring you have a strong foundation to write effective and maintainable tests.

### Test, Test Suite, and Test Case

- **Test**: A single function that exercises a piece of code and verifies expected behavior using assertions. It may succeed, fail, or be skipped.

- **Test Suite**: A logical grouping of related tests. It helps organize tests to reflect the structure of the code being tested.

- **Test Case**: Historically used synonymously with *Test Suite* in GoogleTest, but now the preferred term in GoogleTest is *Test Suite*.

> **Note:** Terminology can differ in other tools and standards. GoogleTest aligns *Test* with ISTQB's *Test Case*, and uses *Test Suite* for grouping.

### Assertions

Assertions are conditions checked within tests to verify correctness.

- **Fatal Assertions (ASSERT_*)**: When these fail, the current test function aborts immediately, preventing further code execution and assertions inside that test. Use when continuing after failure is meaningless or unsafe.

- **Nonfatal Assertions (EXPECT_*)**: When these fail, the current test continues running, allowing multiple assertion failures to be reported in one run.

#### Example
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(vec.size(), 3) << "Vector size must be 3";
EXPECT_EQ(vec[0], 1);
EXPECT_EQ(vec[1], 2);
EXPECT_EQ(vec[2], 3);
```
This lets you catch all indexing errors even if the size check fails.

### Matchers

Matchers specify patterns tests expect for arguments or values. They provide expressive ways to verify if data meets certain criteria beyond simple equality.

Common matchers include: `_` (wildcard, matches anything), `Eq(value)`, `Ge(value)` (greater or equal), and complex combinations like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, or custom matchers you can define.

Example usage:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(5)));  // Expect Foo called with argument >= 5
```

### Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests in your code base registered using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and related macros.

You do not need to enumerate your tests manually. After building your test executable, all registered tests run by invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Mocks and Mock Objects

**Mock objects** simulate parts of the system that your code interacts with, such as dependencies or collaborators.

- Mock classes are defined by subclassing interfaces and using `MOCK_METHOD()` macros.
- Expectations about which methods will be called and with what arguments are expressed via `EXPECT_CALL()`.
- The behavior of these mock methods can be customized with clauses like `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, and modifiers like `.Times()`.

Mocks help you isolate the code under test and validate its interactions precisely.

### Death Tests

Death tests verify that a specific statement causes the program to terminate (e.g., due to failed assertions or fatal signals).

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, matcher)` to confirm that `statement` triggers termination matching the error output pattern `matcher`.
- Death tests run in a separate process to safely verify crashes.
- Proper naming conventions like ending test suite names with `DeathTest` help manage threading and execution order.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

These tests run the same code multiple times with various input values to validate behavior across different data.

- Create a test fixture derived from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is parameter type.
- Write your test using `TEST_P()`, accessing the parameter via `GetParam()`.
- Instantiate tests using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` with a parameter generator such as `Values()`, `Range()`, or `Combine()`.

Example:
```cpp
class MyTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, HandlesValues) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(RangeTests, MyTest, testing::Range(1, 5));
```

### Type-Parameterized Tests

Type-parameterized tests enable running the same test code for multiple types, helpful when ensuring generic code correctness.

- Define a fixture template derived from `testing::Test`.
- Declare your tests with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` and `TYPED_TEST()`.
- Supply a list of types via `testing::Types<>`.

Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test { };

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, float>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, CanInitialize) {
  TypeParam value = TypeParam{};
  EXPECT_EQ(value, TypeParam{});
}
```

### Test Lifecycle

- Each test runs in isolation.
- If using test fixtures, a fresh fixture object is created for each test.
- Setup and teardown happen via `SetUp()`, `TearDown()` per test.
- Shared setup for test suites can be done via `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Use `EXPECT_` assertions when tests should continue to uncover multiple issues, and `ASSERT_` when continuing after failure is unsafe.**
- **Always set expectations on mocks before the code under test invokes mocked methods.**
- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add helpful context to assertion failures when you call shared helper functions.**
- **Prefer testing behavior through public interfaces rather than private or internal code.**
- **Wrap template and complex test constructs carefully, especially when combining multiple parameter types and their names.**
- **Name death tests with a `DeathTest` suffix in test suite names to avoid threading issues and ensure proper execution order.**

|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test                            | Single function containing assertions that verify code behavior. |
| Test Suite (formerly Test Case) | Grouping of related tests; shared setup possible.           |
| Assertion (ASSERT_/EXPECT_)     | Condition that verifies a property; controls test outcome.  |
| Matcher                        | Predicate describing acceptable argument or value patterns. |
| Mock Object                    | Fake implementation facilitating behavior and interaction verification. |
| Death Test                     | Test validating that code termination occurs as expected.   |
| Value-Parameterized Test        | Same test logic run with varying input parameters.          |
| Type-Parameterized Test         | Same test logic run with various type parameters.           |
