# Integration and Extensibility

GoogleTest and Google Mock are designed to fit seamlessly into a wide variety of development environments and workflows. This page explores how you can integrate GoogleTest and Google Mock with popular build systems, leveraged planned dependencies to improve your testing ecosystem, and utilize extensions and adapters to enhance your productivity.

---

## Build System Integration

### Using GoogleTest and Google Mock with CMake

GoogleTest and Google Mock provide official support for CMake-based projects. Integration is straightforward and designed to keep your test builds maintainable and efficient.

**Highlights:**
- CMake targets for GoogleTest and Google Mock are provided, allowing easy inclusion via `find_package(googletest REQUIRED)`.
- Pre-built targets such as `gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, and `gmock_main` are available for linking.

**Basic CMake snippet for integration:**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject LANGUAGES CXX)

# Enable testing support
enable_testing()

# Find GoogleTest package
find_package(googletest REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_test test_main.cpp my_tests.cpp)

target_link_libraries(my_test PRIVATE gtest_main gmock)

add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_test)
```

This setup compiles your tests, links against GoogleTest and Google Mock libraries, and registers the test executable with CTest.

### Using GoogleTest and Google Mock with Bazel

If you use Bazel as your build system, GoogleTest and Google Mock integrate natively via their own Bazel build files.

- The rules provide separate `cc_test` targets where you can depend on `@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main` or `@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main` to get main functions and link in the mocking framework.
- They support fine-grained control over test dependencies and reporting.

Refer to the [GoogleTest Bazel Integration Guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/README.md#bazel) for detailed instructions.

## Planned Dependencies: Abseil

GoogleTest and Google Mock are planned to interoperate closely with [Abseil](https://abseil.io/), a collection of C++ common libraries developed by Google.

- Abseil offers utilities like strings, synchronization, memory management, and more, well-suited to complement testing code.
- Enhanced integration with Abseil facilities is expected, improving test writing brevity and robustness.

This alignment ensures that Google's recommended C++ libraries form a cohesive ecosystem for production and testing.

## Extensions and Adapters

### IDE Plugins and Tooling

To boost developer productivity, multiple IDEs have plugins or extensions supporting GoogleTest and Google Mock:

- Syntax highlighting and code snippets for test definitions and mock usage.
- Test discovery and run integration inside the IDE, allowing one-click test execution and failure navigation.
- Debugging support mapping failures to source code.

Explore your IDE's plugin marketplace for GoogleTest or Google Mock bundles.

### Support for New Protocols and Languages

GoogleTest is primarily a C++ testing framework. However, extensibility via adapters allows interfacing with other languages or test protocols:

- Wrappers for integrating with Python or Java test harnesses.
- Test event forwarding for CI systems via standard formats like JUnit XML or Test Anything Protocol (TAP).

Such adapters enable GoogleTest to fit into broader automation pipelines.

## Summary

GoogleTest and Google Mock extend their utility far beyond just being a testing framework through smooth build system integration, planned complementary dependencies, and tooling support. Whether you are building with CMake or Bazel, or integrating with IDEs and CI systems, GoogleTest is engineered for flexibility and developer efficiency.

## Getting Started Tips

- Choose the build system integration method that matches your project's infrastructure.
- Explore Abseil to leverage its facilities alongside GoogleTest for modern C++ utility.
- Utilize your IDE's GoogleTest support or add one if not available to improve your testing workflow.
- Familiarize yourself with output formats and adapters for easy integration with CI/CD tools.
