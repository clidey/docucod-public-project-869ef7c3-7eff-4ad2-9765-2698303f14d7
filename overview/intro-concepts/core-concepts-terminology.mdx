# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational glossary of GoogleTest, your quick reference to essential concepts and terminology that underpin effective testing using this framework. This page demystifies key ideas such as test fixtures, assertions, matchers, parameterized and typed tests, death tests, and mock objects — all explained in everyday language tailored for C++ developers.

Understanding these concepts will empower you to write more reliable, maintainable tests and navigate the full GoogleTest ecosystem with confidence.

## What Is a Test in GoogleTest?

A **test** is the smallest unit of validation you write. It checks a specific piece of your code by running logic and making **assertions** to verify expected behavior. Every test lives inside a **test suite**.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

Here, `FactorialTest` is the test suite; `HandlesZeroInput` is the test name.


## Test Suites and Fixtures

### Test Suites

A **test suite** groups related tests together, often reflecting a component or function of your software. This grouping helps organize your tests logically.

### Test Fixtures

A **test fixture** is a class that provides a shared environment for multiple tests, helping you reuse setup and teardown code.

For example, if many tests need the same objects or data, define a test fixture:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
     q1_.Enqueue(1);
     q2_.Enqueue(2); q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};
```

Then write tests using the fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each test operates on a fresh fixture instance, ensuring independence.


## Assertions: Verifying Expected Behavior

Assertions are conditions your test checks to confirm correct behavior. Failures are reported with helpful messages.

- `EXPECT_*`: Nonfatal assertions that report failures but let tests keep running.
- `ASSERT_*`: Fatal assertions that abort the current test if they fail.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Result did not match expected value.";
```

You can assert booleans, compare values, strings, containers, exception throwing, and more.


## Matchers: Precise and Expressive Checks

Matchers let you specify rich conditions for expected values in assertions and mock expectations.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(my_string, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
```

Matchers read like natural language and generate detailed failure messages, helping diagnose problems faster.


## Parameterized Tests: Testing Multiple Inputs Efficiently

Parameterized tests let you run the same test logic over different data values without repetition.

You define a test fixture that inherits from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the parameter type.

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesStrings) {
  std::string param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(Validate(param));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Examples, FooTest, testing::Values("input1", "input2"));
```

This runs `HandlesStrings` twice, once with each input.


## Typed Tests: Testing Across Multiple Types

Typed tests let you reuse the same test logic with different types, useful for testing template classes or interfaces.

You write a fixture template:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, IsDefaultConstructed) {
  TypeParam val = this->value_;
  EXPECT_EQ(val, TypeParam());
}
```

The same test is run for both `int` and `double`.


## Death Tests: Verifying Program Aborts

Sometimes your code must crash or terminate under certain conditions (e.g., failed assertions). These are called **death tests**.

GoogleTest supports macros like `ASSERT_DEATH()` and `EXPECT_DEATH()` to verify such behavior.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, CrashesOnBadInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({ DoSomething(-1); }, "Invalid argument");
}
```

The test passes if `DoSomething(-1)` terminates the process and produces an error message containing "Invalid argument".


## Mock Objects: Simulating Dependencies

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest with mock objects that simulate and verify interactions with dependencies.

- Define mocks with `MOCK_METHOD` inside mock classes.
- Set expectations on mock method calls with `EXPECT_CALL`.

Example mock class:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x), (override));
};
```

Example test using mocks:

```cpp
MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5)).WillOnce(Return(10));
EXPECT_EQ(mock.Bar(5), 10);
```

Mocking lets you isolate your code and verify its behavior precisely.


## Additional Core Concepts

- **Test Event Listeners:** Components you can write to customize handling of test events (start, finish, failures).
- **RecordProperty:** Log arbitrary key/value properties about tests that get included in reports.
- **Test Filters:** Select which tests to run via patterns like `--gtest_filter=FooTest.*`.


## How This Page Fits Into GoogleTest Documentation

- Complements the [What is GoogleTest?](overview/intro-concepts/what-is-googletest) overview.
- Provides foundational terminology referenced in detailed guides like [Writing Your First Test](guides/getting-started/writing-first-test) and [Assertions, Macros & Expectations](guides/core-test-design/assertions-macros).
- Links to related advanced topics such as [Parameterized & Typed Tests](guides/core-test-design/parameterized-typed-tests) and [Death Tests & Error Handling](guides/core-test-design/death-tests-error-handling).


## Practical Tips

- Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names to prevent naming conflicts and compilation errors.
- Use test fixtures to reduce repetition and share setup across related tests.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` for checking multiple conditions and `ASSERT_*` when early exit on failure is necessary.
- Use parameterized tests to efficiently verify behavior over multiple inputs.
- Leverage matchers to write clear and expressive assertions.
- Employ mock objects to isolate units and verify interactions.


## Troubleshooting Common Confusions

- **Why can't I use `ASSERT_*` in constructors?** GoogleTest only allows fatal assertions in void-returning functions; constructors are non-void.

- **What’s the difference between uninteresting and unexpected mock calls?**
  - *Uninteresting*: No expectation set; generates a warning by default.
  - *Unexpected*: Calls don't match any expectation; fails the test.

- **How to get custom failure messages?** Use streaming with `<<` in assertions or write custom matchers.

- **How to control test execution?** Use filters, disable tests with `DISABLED_` prefix, and use flags like `--gtest_fail_fast`.
