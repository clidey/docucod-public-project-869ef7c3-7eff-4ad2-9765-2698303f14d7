# Who Should Use GoogleTest

GoogleTest is designed for C++ developers, test engineers, and contributors who require a robust framework to write, organize, and maintain comprehensive tests for their C++ codebases. Whether you are building small libraries or large-scale applications, GoogleTest provides the tools you need to ensure code correctness, prevent regressions, and improve overall software quality.

---

## Primary Audience

- **C++ Developers:** Engineers responsible for writing application, library, or system code in C++. GoogleTest helps them verify that individual units and integrated components behave as expected.

- **Test Engineers:** Specialized testers who design test cases and automate testing workflows. GoogleTest supports developing both simple unit tests and sophisticated interaction tests using mocks.

- **Open Source Contributors:** Developers contributing to C++ open-source projects who want a standardized, well-supported testing framework that integrates easily into various build and CI environments.

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Unit Testing

GoogleTest excels at verifying the correctness of minimal, independent parts of your application, such as functions and classes. By defining focused tests, developers can validate behavior early and fix issues before higher-level integration.

**Example scenario:** Testing a mathematical library class to ensure all arithmetic functions produce valid results across edge cases.

### 2. Integration Testing

GoogleTest can be used to write tests that verify the interactions among multiple components, validating that their combined behavior satisfies system requirements.

**Example scenario:** Testing how different modules of a networking stack collaborate to send and receive packets.

### 3. Mocking Collaborations

Using GoogleMock, the mocking extension bundled with GoogleTest, you can simulate dependencies and verify interactions, which enables testing components in isolation from their real collaborators.

**Example scenario:** Testing a payment processor by mocking the underlying payment gateway to simulate success and failure cases without external system access.

### 4. Regression Prevention

GoogleTest supports automated test suites that run regularly and catch regressions early, helping teams maintain code stability even as their code bases grow and evolve.

**Example scenario:** Continuous integration runs a suite of thousands of tests on every code commit, signaling failures immediately if any behavior changes unexpectedly.

### 5. Behavior Verification and Design Aid

Beyond testing, GoogleTest combined with GoogleMock encourages interaction-based testing. This helps developers clarify design intentions and enables better decoupling of components.

**Example scenario:** Defining mock objects to specify and verify the expected sequence of calls and interactions between components.

## Real-World Scenarios for Adoption

- **An individual library author** who wants to ship reliable and well-tested code.
- **A team maintaining a large application** that requires tight integration with continuous testing workflows.
- **A developer adopting test-driven development (TDD)** practices in C++.
- **An open-source project** seeking a popular, widely-used testing framework that lowers the barrier to contribution.
- **Test automation engineers** aiming to extend test coverage through mocks and stubs.

---

## Benefits for Users

- Access to a feature-rich, C++-native testing framework.
- Readable and maintainable test syntax with powerful assertion macros.
- Tight integration of mocking and testing for comprehensive test coverage.
- Scalability from small projects to massive codebases.
- Compatibility with popular build systems and CI tools.

---

## Best Practices

- Use GoogleTest for small scoped tests first (unit tests), then expand to integration tests as needed.
- Leverage GoogleMock to isolate dependencies and write more robust, faster tests.
- Integrate with CI early to catch regressions continuously.
- Regularly review and refactor test code as part of your development cycle.

## Getting Started

If this describes you or your team, your next step is to start with the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) to learn how to write and run your first tests. Then move on to [GoogleMock for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md) to learn mocking basics, followed by advancing your skills through the [gMock Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md).

<Note>
Taking the time to architect your tests with mocks and matchers can greatly increase your ability to verify complex interactions and edge cases.
