# Common Use Cases & Real World Impact

Explore how GoogleTest and GoogleMock empower developers to write robust, efficient, and safe C++ tests. This page showcases a spectrum of usage—from straightforward unit tests to intricate integration and mocking scenarios—highlighting why these tools have become essential in safety-critical and performance-sensitive domains. You’ll also find examples of marquee adopters in both open-source and commercial projects, illustrating real-world impact.

## Why This Matters

Imagine you are responsible for delivering a complex C++ system—be it embedded software in avionics, a high-frequency trading platform, or a critical backend service. You need your tests to be reliable, insightful, and performance-conscious. GoogleTest and GoogleMock help you achieve that by:

- **Verifying correctness early** in the development cycle through expressive, easy-to-write unit tests.
- **Safeguarding integration points** with powerful mocking and precise interaction verification.
- **Reducing fragility and flakiness** of tests by controlling dependencies and replicating fault scenarios.

This documentation page serves as your guide to understanding how these capabilities translate into real productivity and quality gains.

## Standard to Advanced Use Cases

The uses of GoogleTest & GoogleMock span a continuum of testing needs. Here’s what typical and advanced users achieve:

### 1. Basic Unit Testing

**Goal:** Validate individual functions and methods behave correctly in isolation.

- Write concise tests to assert outcomes using expressive assertions.
- Automate test discovery and execution to catch regressions early.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MathUtilsTest, AdditionWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);
}
```

### 2. Advanced Unit Testing Patterns

**Goal:** Handle complex input variations and error conditions.

- Use parameterized and typed tests to cover multiple inputs efficiently.
- Handle death tests and exception scenarios safely.

Example: Running a function against a suite of inputs without duplicating code.

### 3. Mocking and Interaction Verification

**Goal:** Test object collaborations and external interaction without dependencies.

- Automatically generate mocks for real interfaces with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Define expectations on method calls, arguments, call sequence, and return behaviors.
- Use actions and matchers to simulate complex behaviors.

Example:
```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, InsertRecord, (const Record&), (override));
};

TEST(DataServiceTest, InsertsData) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, InsertRecord(_)).WillOnce(Return(true));

  DataService service(&mock_db);
  service.SaveData(sample_record);
}
```

### 4. Complex Integration and Partial Mocks

**Goal:** Test higher-level modules that combine multiple components.

- Use sequences and `After` clauses to define partial orders of calls.
- Combine mocks with real implementations for hybrid behaviors.
- Use default actions (`ON_CALL`) to provide fallbacks and reduce test boilerplate.

### 5. Safety-Critical and Performance-Conscious Testing

**Goal:** Ensure tests support stringent requirements in critical domains.

- Guarantee no side effects or unverified calls with strict mock variants.
- Detect interaction violations immediately with detailed reports.
- Enable fast test execution by mocking out slow or unavailable resources.

## Marquee Adopters and Impact

GoogleTest and GoogleMock have been embraced broadly across industry sectors and open-source projects:

- **Embedded Systems:** Avionics and automotive developers rely on GoogleTest to certify safety with clear test specifications and failure diagnostics.
- **Financial Services:** High-frequency trading platforms use GoogleMock to simulate market feeds and decision logic without risking live data.
- **Cloud Services:** Scalable backend systems secure reliability and maintainability through comprehensive mocks of network and database interactions.
- **Open Source:** Many popular libraries such as Abseil and gRPC test core logic with googletest primitives and mocks.

Organizations benefit from reduced development time, higher confidence in releases, and ease of refactoring critical code with automated tests that catch regression early and clearly.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Start simple, expand as needed:** Begin testing with basic unit tests; add mocking and ordering only when collaboration verification is necessary.
- **Set expectations before exercising mocks:** Always declare `EXPECT_CALL` prior to invoking mock methods to avoid undefined behaviors.
- **Prefer nice mocks for routine tests:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress irrelevant warnings; upgrade to `StrictMock` only when enforcing strict interaction policies.
- **Use sequences and `After` for complex scenarios:** When order matters, explicitly constrain it rather than relying on implicit behaviors.
- **Leverage default actions (`ON_CALL`):** Provide common fallback behaviors to keep tests clean and focused.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and How to Resolve Them">
<Accordion title="Uninteresting Call Warning">
If you see warnings about uninteresting calls, it means that a mock method was invoked without an `EXPECT_CALL` set. Consider whether you need to add an expectation or suppress the warning using `NiceMock`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Failed Expectations on Call Count">
Often caused by expectations being called fewer or more times than specified. Review cardinalities (`Times()`) and the order of calls. For ordering, verify if `InSequence` or `After` clauses are needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock Method Called on Non-Virtual Function">
Ensure all methods you want to mock are declared virtual in the base class. If not, consider refactoring or using high-perf dependency injection techniques.
