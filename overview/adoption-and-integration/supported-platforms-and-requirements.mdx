# Supported Platforms & Requirements

## Overview

This page provides a clear snapshot of the officially supported C++ standards, compilers, and operating systems for GoogleTest. Understanding these supported platforms and their associated prerequisites is essential for a seamless installation process, effective integration, and long-term maintenance of your test environment. By adhering to these requirements, you ensure stable, portable, and maintainable test suites that run reliably across supported setups.

---

## Supported C++ Standards

GoogleTest requires an environment that supports the C++17 standard or later. This is pivotal for compatibility and utilization of modern C++ features beneficial for writing expressive and efficient tests.

- **Requirement:** Minimum C++17 Standard
- **How to Ensure Compatibility:**
  - In a CMake build, add to your top level `CMakeLists.txt`:
    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```
  - Alternatively, specify compiler flags manually, for example:
    ```bash
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=c++17'
    ```

**Tip:** For projects written in C without native C++ code, you can still specify these compiler flags to ensure compatibility when integrating GoogleTest.

---

## Supported Compilers

GoogleTest actively supports a broad range of modern C++ compilers across platforms. Key requirements and practical considerations include:

- **Visual Studio (MSVC)**
  - Version: Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
  - Note: When using MSVC, ensure runtime libraries are compatible. GoogleTest provides a CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to help align dynamic/static runtime linkage.

- **GCC and Clang**
  - GCC: Version 7.0 or newer recommended
  - Clang: Modern versions supporting C++17

- **Intel LLVM and Other Compilers**
  - Basic support given sufficient C++17 compatibility

GoogleTest build scripts for CMake include pre-configured compiler flag handling to accommodate warning level settings, exception and RTTI flags, and threading support.

---

## Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and supports a wide range of operating systems, including but not limited to:

- **Windows**
  - Windows Desktop (Windows 7 and later)
  - Windows via MinGW
  - Windows Mobile variants (limited support)

- **Linux Distributions**
  - Including Android (with some limitations)
  - Various flavors such as Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian

- **macOS / iOS**
  - macOS Desktop and server systems
  - iOS (limited functionality due to restrictions)

- **UNIX Variants**
  - FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD
  - Solaris, AIX, HP-UX

- **Embedded and Specialty Platforms**
  - ESP32, ESP8266
  - Native Client (NaCl)
  - QNX
  
The platform-specific macros in GoogleTest headers (e.g., `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`) enable the framework to tailor behavior and optimizations accordingly.

---

## Threading and Concurrency

GoogleTest detects and enables thread safety features depending on platform capabilities:

- On platforms supporting POSIX threads (`pthread`), GoogleTest is thread-safe.
  - Define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to force pthread usage if auto-detection fails.
  - Link with `-pthread` where applicable.

- Windows uses native threading APIs and synchronization primitives.

- On embedded or limited platforms lacking threading support, GoogleTest disables thread safety features.

**Best Practice:** Use the official CMake build system or pkg-config integration to automatically manage threading flags.

---

## Build System and Integration Considerations

- GoogleTest integrates well with popular build systems such as CMake and supports `pkg-config` for easy flags management.

- When building standalone or integrating into an existing project:
  - Use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` and link through `GTest::gtest` or `GTest::gmock` targets.
  - Leverage `target_compile_options()` and `target_link_libraries()` with `pkg-config` outputs to ensure all compiler and linker flags (including threading, include paths, macros) are respected.

- Cross-compilation scenarios require setting certain environment variables like `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` and `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` to correctly resolve paths inside the target sysroot.

---

## Known Limitations and Best Practices

- GoogleTest is not compatible with C++ standards earlier than C++17.
- While header-only usage is possible, building GoogleTest as static or shared libraries ensures better performance and integration.
- Avoid conflicting macro definitions by using provided GoogleTest macros or disabling macro definitions via flags (e.g., `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1`).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Pkg-config Not Finding GoogleTest:**
  - Ensure `.pc` files are installed and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes the directory where they exist.
  - For cross-compilation, make sure `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` and `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` are set properly.

- **Linking Errors:**
  - Verify correct linkage with threading libraries like `-pthread`.
  - Ensure runtime libraries are compatible with your compiler flags (e.g., static vs dynamic CRT on MSVC).

- **Unsupported Platform:**
  - GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms; for unsupported platforms, consider contributing fixes or consult community forums.

## Summary

By following the supported C++ standards, compiler versions, and operating system requirements outlined, users can achieve reliable, efficient, and maintainable test suites with GoogleTest. Integration with popular build tools and awareness of threading and linking intricacies ensures that GoogleTest fits smoothly into diverse development environments.
