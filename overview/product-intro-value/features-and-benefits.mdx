# Key Features & Benefits

GoogleTest combines powerful features that streamline C++ testing, making it easier for developers and teams to write robust, maintainable, and efficient tests. This page highlights the core capabilities of GoogleTest and explains the practical advantages they deliver.

---

## Test Discovery & Automatic Execution

GoogleTest automatically detects and runs all tests defined in your code without manual registration.

- **Benefit:** Rapid iteration with no setup overhead — just write tests, and they run.
- **Use Case:** Easily scale test suites without additional maintenance.

## Rich Set of Assertions

Leverage a comprehensive collection of assertion macros covering basic checks through complex comparisons.

- `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*` assertions allow for flexible failure handling.
- Extensive value-based assertions simplify verifying expected conditions.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, SimpleAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(5, Add(2, 3));
  ASSERT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));
}
```

- **Benefit:** Clear and expressive tests that quickly pinpoint failures.

## Death Tests

Specialized tests that verify your program correctly handles fatal failure conditions.

- Run code in a separate process to check for crashes or termination.

- **Use Case:** Ensuring robustness under invalid input or states.

## Parameterized Tests

Write flexible, data-driven tests by supplying a range of inputs and expected results to the same test logic.

- Avoid repetition.
- Test many scenarios with concise code.

**Example:**
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectly) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), ExpectedFactorial(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Default, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 8));
```

- **Benefit:** Improved test coverage with less code.

## Extensibility & Customization

GoogleTest supports extending with custom matchers, actions, and event listeners.

- Craft matchers that express complex domain logic.
- Enhance failure messages for clearer debugging.
- Integrate with CI pipelines and IDEs.

- **Use Case:** Tailor the framework to your project’s unique needs.
