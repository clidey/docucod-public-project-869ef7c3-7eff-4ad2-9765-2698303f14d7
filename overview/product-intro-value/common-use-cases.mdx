# Common Use Cases and Scenarios

GoogleTest and GoogleMock empower you with a robust framework for comprehensive testing in C++. This page briefly highlights the various testing styles supported by GoogleTest and the typical scenarios where its strengths become most apparent. Whether you are verifying the correctness of individual functions or enforcing complex interaction contracts between software components, GoogleTest offers solutions tailored to your needs.

## Supported Testing Styles

GoogleTest supports a variety of testing styles that fit distinct objectives and code designs:

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual components or functions to verify correctness in isolation. GoogleTest streamlines writing, running, and organizing unit tests.

- **Mocking Dependencies:** With GoogleMock integrated, you can replace real dependencies with mock objects to precisely control and verify interactions, enabling tests that are more deterministic, faster, and focused.

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with different input values. This reduces duplication and enhances coverage systematically.

- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Test templates with multiple types, invaluable for testing generic code such as container classes or algorithms.

- **Test Automation:** GoogleTest effortlessly integrates into automated build and CI systems, promoting continuous validation with minimal maintenance.


### Real-World Example of a Testing Style Flow

Imagine working on a safety-critical module that interacts with hardware sensors. You want to:

1. Write **unit tests** to verify the processing logic for sensor data.
2. Use **mock objects** to simulate sensor APIs, ensuring your module reacts properly to various sensor states.
3. Employ **parameterized tests** to validate edge cases, such as sensor value thresholds.
4. Automate these tests to run on every code change, maintaining confidence in regression safety.

GoogleTest and GoogleMock together make this flow seamless.

## Typical Situations Where GoogleTest Shines

GoogleTest’s feature set uniquely suits certain development challenges and quality goals. Here are some scenarios where it particularly excels:

- **API Contract Verification:**
  Use GoogleMock to define mock interfaces and verify that your components invoke other modules correctly in terms of method calls, argument values, and call order.

- **Safety-Critical Code:**
  Thorough unit testing with strict expectations guards against regressions and uncaught errors in modules where correctness is paramount.

- **Regression Protection:**
  Catch unintended side effects early by automating comprehensive test suites that confirm previously validated behaviors continue to hold.

- **Complex Interaction Testing:**
  Specify call sequences, cardinalities, and argument constraints on mocks to precisely validate complex protocols or workflows between components.

- **Rapid Interface Prototyping:**
  Mock objects foster early experimentation with interface design, allowing you to refine APIs before full production implementations exist.

## Before and After GoogleTest

| With GoogleTest & GoogleMock | Without GoogleTest & GoogleMock |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Quickly create mock objects for dependencies and define expectations in concise code | Manually write complex mock classes or struggle with fragile, I/O bound tests |
| Detect violations of expected interactions as soon as they occur with clear diagnostics | Bugs found late via indirect side-effect checks or manual QA cycles |
| Easily execute parameterized and type-parameterized tests to cover many cases with little code | Repeated, error-prone test code with less coverage and higher maintenance |
| Integrate effortlessly in CI pipelines for automated regression testing | Limited automated tests lead to higher risk of regressions and slower releases |

## Getting Started Preview

To start leveraging these testing styles and scenarios with GoogleTest:

- Define your tests using GoogleTest’s simple macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc).
- Create mock classes as needed using GoogleMock’s `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` to specify call behavior and verification.
- Use parameterized test features to run multiple data-driven test instances.
- Automate your tests in your build or CI system for continuous assurance.

See the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md) and [Sample Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest/samples) for practical examples.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use **`ON_CALL`** to set default mock behavior without enforcing call expectations, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for interactions you specifically want to verify.
- For strict verification, prefer **`StrictMock`** objects to catch unexpected calls.
- Use **sequences (`InSequence`) and order constraints** for tests sensitive to call order.
- Compose **matchers** to verify arguments flexibly.
- Be cautious of over-specifying expectations — tests should verify contracts, not implementation details.
