# Core Features at a Glance

GoogleTest (gTest) and GoogleMock (gMock) form a powerful suite for testing C++ code, providing robust and flexible testing capabilities. Whether you are developing new software or maintaining existing projects, these frameworks enable you to write comprehensive tests that ensure code quality and reliability.

---

## Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs tests based on your defined test cases and test fixtures, eliminating manual test registration. This automation accelerates your testing workflow by letting you focus on writing tests rather than managing them.

You can control test execution with fine granularity, running all tests, selected tests, or filtered subsets based on test names or attributes. This makes it easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines and local iterative development.


## Rich Assertion Library

GoogleTest provides an extensive set of assertions for verifying test results, including:

- Checking equality and inequality
- Floating point comparison with tolerances
- Exception and death tests
- Predicate assertions for custom validation

The assertion system delivers precise diagnostics with clear failure messages and call stacks, making debugging straightforward.


## Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest enables writing generalized tests that run with multiple data sets or types, minimizing code duplication:

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with different input values.
- **Typed Tests:** Use the same test logic for different types.

This helps efficiently test libraries and templates across various scenarios.


## Mocking with GoogleMock

GoogleMock integrates seamlessly with GoogleTest, offering:

- Easy creation of mock classes with the `MOCK_METHOD` macro
- Flexible setting of expectations about function calls, arguments, call count, and order
- Wide array of matchers for argument validation
- Rich built-in and custom actions to define mock behaviors

### Key mocking capabilities include:

- **Strict, Nice, and Naggy Mocks:** Control how uninteresting calls are handled.
- **Support for Overloaded Functions and Templates:** Mock complex APIs with ease.
- **Delegation Patterns:** Delegate to real objects, fakes, or base class implementations.
- **Composite Expectations:** Enforce call sequences, partial orders, and cardinalities.


## Death Tests

GoogleTest supports robust testing of code that is expected to terminate or fail with fatal errors. This ensures that your code handles error conditions appropriately.


## Flexible Test Execution

Tests can be configured to run in various ways, including filters, repeat counts, sharding, and output formats (e.g., XML for CI integration).


## Benefits Summary

Using GoogleTest and GoogleMock together equips C++ developers with:

- **Fast and automated test validation** that integrates with build systems
- **Powerful mocking capabilities** to isolate units and verify interactions
- **Expressive syntax** that keeps tests readable and maintainable
- **Cross-platform support** with consistent behavior across environments


## Example: Basic Mock Setup

Here is a snippet illustrating how to define and use a mock class with GoogleMock:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual std::string Describe(int type) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Describe, (int type), (override));
};

TEST(FooTest, BasicMock) {
  StrictMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, GetSize())
      .WillOnce(testing::Return(5));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_foo.GetSize(), 5);
}
```

## Tips for Getting Started

- Include `<gmock/gmock.h>` in your test files to access both GoogleTest and GoogleMock features.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expected interactions before exercising the tested code.
- Default mock behaviors allow your tests to continue without explicitly specifying every call.
- Transition from naggy to nice mocks to reduce noise in tests, or use strict mocks when you require zero tolerance for unexpected calls.


Harnessing these core features empowers you to write reliable, maintainable, and intelligent tests that provide confidence in your C++ codebase.
