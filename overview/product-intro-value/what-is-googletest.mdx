# What is GoogleTest?

## Introduction: GoogleTest at a Glance

GoogleTest is Google's open source C++ testing framework designed to help you write reliable, maintainable, and fast tests for your C++ codebases. Built with Google's rigorous standards in mind, it supports writing unit tests and many other kinds of tests, enabling teams to confidently verify their software's correctness across platforms.

By using GoogleTest, engineers can structure tests clearly, run them independently, and obtain detailed failure reports that accelerate debugging and improve software quality.

## Origins and Purpose

GoogleTest began as an internal framework at Google to satisfy the need for a portable, flexible, and high-performance C++ testing solution tailored specifically for large-scale and diverse codebases.

Its core mission is:

- To enable writing tests that are *independent* and *repeatable*.
- To organize tests into suites that reflect code structure and improve maintainability.
- To provide extensive runtime information, including nuanced failure messages and the ability to continue tests after non-fatal failures.
- To support a wide range of platforms, compilers, and build environments without compromising performance or usability.

This dedication to practical software testing challenges sets GoogleTest apart, making it a robust choice for professional and enterprise-grade C++ projects.

## Problems GoogleTest Solves

C++ testing can be complex and cumbersome, often requiring manual setup, brittle tests, and limited failure insight. GoogleTest addresses these pain points by:

- **Isolating Tests**: Each test runs on a fresh object, preventing side effects and promoting test independence.
- **Automating Test Registration and Execution**: No need to manually list tests for execution; GoogleTest auto-discovers and runs defined tests.
- **Rich Assertion Support**: Provides both fatal (`ASSERT_*`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) assertions, allowing multiple checks in one test for comprehensive coverage.
- **Parameterizing Tests**: Supports value-parameterized and typed tests to easily test multiple inputs and types without code duplication.
- **Clear Failure Diagnostics**: Detailed error messages, stack traces, and contextual traces with macros like `SCOPED_TRACE` help diagnose problems swiftly.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works uniformly across Linux, Windows, Mac, and embedded systems.
- **Thread Safety**: Designed to be thread-safe on supported platforms, enabling concurrent test execution.

These capabilities make GoogleTest a powerful framework to write reliable C++ tests that scale with your project's complexity.

## Who Uses GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is employed by many organizations and open source projects worldwide, including Google itself, where it originated. If you or your team:

- Develop C++ applications ranging from embedded systems to large-scale servers
- Need well-structured, repeatable tests to ensure code quality
- Want to leverage a mature, community-vetted testing framework

then GoogleTest is well-suited for your testing needs.

## Target Audience

This introduction is ideal for:

- C++ engineers evaluating testing frameworks
- Team leads seeking a robust solution for automated testing
- Organizations aiming for higher code quality and reduced regression risk

Understanding what GoogleTest is and what it offers will empower you to decide if it aligns with your project's goals.

## Next Steps

To learn how to build and integrate GoogleTest into your project, visit the [Installation with CMake](../getting-started/requirements-installation/installation-cmake.md) guide.

Explore tutorials on [Writing and Running Your First Test](../getting-started/configuration-bootstrap/first-test-case.md) to start authoring effective tests.

For a deeper dive into features and concepts, including assertions, fixtures, and parameterized tests, the [GoogleTest Primer](../docs/primer.md) provides hands-on examples and practical advice.

### Example: Simple Test with GoogleTest

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple function to test
int Add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Define a test suite "MathTest" and a test "AddsTwoNumbers"
TEST(MathTest, AddsTwoNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(-1, 1), 0);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This test runs with GoogleTest's framework, automatically reporting success or failure, and is portable and repeatable.
