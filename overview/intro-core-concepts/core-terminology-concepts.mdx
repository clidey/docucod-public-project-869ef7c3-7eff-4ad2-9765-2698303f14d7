# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to the foundational overview where you will familiarize yourself with the language and abstractions central to working effectively with GoogleTest. This documentation focuses on the key terms, components, and conceptual models that underpin GoogleTest's powerful C++ testing framework.

---

## Understanding GoogleTest’s Landscape

GoogleTest is a C++ testing framework inspired by xUnit architecture. Before diving into writing tests, it’s essential to understand the concepts and terminology that will guide your journey.

### Why Care About These Concepts?
Knowing these terms helps you:
- Communicate clearly with team members about tests and testing strategies.
- Understand the structure and flow of tests you write or maintain.
- Efficiently leverage GoogleTest’s features such as assertions, test fixtures, test runners, and more.

---

## Key Terms & Core Abstractions

### 1. xUnit Architecture
GoogleTest follows the xUnit architecture, a pattern for unit testing frameworks characterized by:

- **Test Cases and Test Suites**: Groupings of related test logic.
- **Test Runners**: Components responsible for discovering and executing tests.
- **Fixtures**: Setup and teardown logic to prepare test environments.

### 2. Assertions
Assertions verify that code behavior matches expectations. GoogleTest provides rich assertions such as:

- `EXPECT_*` statements that continue the test even after failure.
- `ASSERT_*` statements that abort the current test on failure.

Examples:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(expected_value, actual_value);
ASSERT_TRUE(condition);
```

### 3. Test Fixtures
Test fixtures define a fixed environment for multiple tests, allowing shared setup and teardown logic.

Example:
```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code here runs before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Code here runs after each test
  }
};
```

Multiple tests can then inherit from `MyTestFixture` to reuse setup logic.

### 4. Test Discovery
GoogleTest automatically discovers tests by scanning the compiled test binary for test macros. It finds tests defined with:

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`
- `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` for fixture-based tests

### 5. Death Tests
Special tests that verify that a piece of code terminates or crashes as expected.

Usage:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ code_that_should_crash(); }, "expected error message");
```

### 6. Parameterized Tests
Enable you to run the same test logic with different inputs.

Example:
```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, TestWithVariousInputs) {
  int param = GetParam();
  // Test logic using param
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyGroup, MyParamTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

### 7. Test Runner
The component that runs all tests and reports results. It manages the execution lifecycle, including test setup, teardown, and capturing output.

The test runner can be invoked by running the test binary, optionally with command-line flags to filter or modify behavior.

---

## How It Fits Together: User Flow

1. **Discover** tests with test runner.
2. **Execute** tests in isolation, with proper fixtures.
3. **Evaluate** assertions to validate behavior.
4. **Report** successes and failures clearly.

This flow, backed by the terminology above, forms the foundation of unit testing with GoogleTest.

---

## Practical Examples to Illustrate Concepts

### Writing a Basic Test with Assertions
```cpp
TEST(ArithmeticTest, AdditionWorks) {
  int a = 2 + 2;
  EXPECT_EQ(4, a);
}
```

### Combining Fixture and Parameterized Tests
```cpp
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

int Factorial(int n) { return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * Factorial(n-1); }

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesVariousInput) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(Factorial(n), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Inputs, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(0,1,2,3,8));
```

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Define clear test suites and test names** to improve readability.
- **Use test fixtures** to avoid duplicating setup and cleanup code.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` for soft assertions** and `ASSERT_*` for critical ones.
- **Leverage parameterized tests** to minimize repetitive code and improve coverage.
- **Write death tests** to verify proper handling of fatal errors.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Tests not discovered?** Ensure you use GoogleTest macros like `TEST`, `TEST_F`, or `TEST_P` to define tests.
- **Tests failing unexpectedly?** Check that `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*` are used correctly.
- **Setup or teardown not executing?** Double-check that your fixtures properly override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods.
- **Death tests not working?** Verify platform support and that tested code indeed triggers fatal failures.
