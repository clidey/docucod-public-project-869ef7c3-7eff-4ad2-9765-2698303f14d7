# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide to GoogleTest and GoogleMock’s essential vocabulary. This page defines and contextualizes the critical concepts you must understand to fluently write, mock, and maintain tests within the GoogleTest ecosystem. Mastering these terms will empower you to create robust test suites, interact confidently with mock objects, and effectively leverage the full power of GoogleTest.

---

## Why This Matters

Understanding key testing concepts is more than memorizing definitions—it’s about gaining clarity on what tests do and how to wield them to uncover software defects early and reliably. GoogleTest provides a versatile set of testing constructs to write clear, maintainable, and expressive tests. Without a solid grasp of these core concepts, it’s easy to miss subtle bugs or fall into common pitfalls.

## Key Terms You Will Encounter

This page introduces the vocabulary critical for success with GoogleTest and GoogleMock, each explained with their significance and practical context.

### 1. Test Case & Test

- **Test Case**: A collection of related test steps designed to verify a specific feature or behavior of the code under test.
- **Test**: An individual verification within a test case that checks a particular condition or function output.

*Example:*
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, AdditionWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);
}
```
Here, `MathTest` is the test case name, and `AdditionWorks` is the test name.

### 2. Test Fixture

A **test fixture** provides a shared environment that multiple tests can reuse. It encapsulates setup and teardown code necessary to prepare and clean up test resources.

*Example:*
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Insert(...));
}
```

### 3. Assertions

**Assertions** check if program behaviors meet expected conditions. GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions like `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_TRUE()`, and `EXPECT_THAT()` using matchers.

- `EXPECT_*` assertions continue test execution on failure.
- `ASSERT_*` assertions abort the current test if they fail.

Using assertions smartly lets you express what you expect from your code explicitly and catch errors early.

### 4. Parameterized & Type-Parameterized Tests

These tests allow writing one test logic that runs multiple times with different inputs or types, improving coverage without redundancy.

- **Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test with varying input values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test logic for different data types.

*Example snippet:*
```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public ::testing::Test {};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, DoesSomething) {
  // Test logic using TypeParam
}
```

### 5. Mock Objects

Mocks are stand-in objects that simulate the behavior of real objects, allowing you to test interactions and isolate components:

- Defined by mocking interfaces or classes with virtual functions.
- You use macros like `MOCK_METHOD` to declare mock methods.
- Control behavior and expectations with `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`.

Mocks verify that your code calls its dependencies as expected.

*Example:*
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const));
};

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(Return(42));
```

### 6. Death Tests

Tests that confirm your program *dies* or terminates under certain error conditions, verifying robustness and error handling. GoogleTest supports death tests that run in subprocesses and verify death conditions safely.

*Example:*
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ SomeFunctionThatFails(); }, "expected error message");
```

## How These Concepts Work Together

At a high level:

- You write **tests** that verify your software behaves correctly; these tests live within **test cases** or can share setup and teardown in **test fixtures**.
- Use **assertions** within tests to check actual results.
- Employ **parameterized tests** to maximize coverage efficiently.
- When your code depends on external modules or hardware, use **mock objects** to simulate their behavior and set expectations.
- For safety-critical checks, use **death tests** to ensure your program responds correctly to fatal errors.

Together, these constructs create a comprehensive testing environment that lets you build reliable, maintainable software.

---

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Always define virtual destructors in interfaces to be mocked** to avoid memory leaks.
- Use **`EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify a call happens**; otherwise use **`ON_CALL` to set default behaviors without expectations**.
- Avoid **overly strict expectations** that can make tests brittle.
- Use **`RetiresOnSaturation()`** when chaining multiple expectations on the same method to prevent unexpected failures.
- When mocking overloaded methods, specify argument types or use `using` declarations to prevent compiler ambiguities.
- Parameterized tests can **reduce duplication** but keep naming clear for easy diagnosis.
