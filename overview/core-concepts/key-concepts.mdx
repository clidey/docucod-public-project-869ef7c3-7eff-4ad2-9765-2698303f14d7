# Essential Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide that introduces the essential concepts and terminology key to mastering GoogleTest. This page lays the groundwork by defining core terms and explaining how they relate, helping you build a clear mental model that accelerates onboarding and effective test writing.

---

## Understanding GoogleTest Core Terms

### Test Case (aka Test Suite)

A **test suite** groups together related tests. Conceptually, it corresponds to a unit or component in your codebase you want to validate. Grouping tests this way keeps your code organized and helps you share common test setup and teardown via fixtures.

- **Role**: Organizes tests logically by functionality or feature
- **Outcome-aware**: GoogleTest executes and reports results grouped per test suite

### Test

A **test** is an individual, named unit of verification within a test suite. Each test is a function that performs checks by asserting conditions about your code.

- **Role**: Encapsulates a distinct check on code behavior
- **Composition**: Contains multiple assertions
- **Naming**: Formed uniquely by `{TestSuiteName}.{TestName}`

### Assertion

An **assertion** is an expression that verifies an invariant or condition within a test. Assertions can result in:

- Success
- Nonfatal failure (test continues)
- Fatal failure (test aborts immediately)

Each assertion macro typically comes in two flavors (`EXPECT_*` for nonfatal and `ASSERT_*` for fatal failures).

### Test Fixture

A **test fixture** is a class that defines the shared environment for multiple tests in the same suite, such as setup and teardown routines or common objects. It is the backbone for tests requiring the same initial state.

- Enables resource sharing
- Supports clean test isolation

### Matcher

**Matchers** describe constraints or patterns used in assertions (such as `EXPECT_THAT`). They allow expressive validations on complex data (strings, containers, etc.) and produce human-readable failure messages.

### Mock

A **mock** is a test double that simulates behavior of real components to isolate units under test. GoogleTest integrates with GoogleMock for mocking functionality, enabling expectation setting, behavior verification, and invocation tracking.

## Relationships and Mental Models

| Concept       | Description                                         | Example/Analogy                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Test Suite    | A container of related tests                        | A Test Suite `MathTest` grouping tests for math functions |
| Test          | A single verification                             | `AdditionWorks` test checking addition behavior |
| Assertion     | The check inside a test                             | `EXPECT_EQ(Add(2,2), 4)` |
| Fixture       | The shared environment for a suite                  | Setting up reusable database connection for all tests in suite |
| Matcher       | A rule or pattern an actual value is matched against| `StartsWith("Hello")` matcher for strings|
| Mock          | A fake object simulating external dependencies      | Mocking a web service in tests to isolate logic |

By thinking of tests as small, atomic verification blocks within grouped suites and leveraging fixtures for common setup, GoogleTest helps you scale your testing systematically.

## Key Types of Tests Supported

### TEST
- Basic, standalone test function not using fixtures.
- Ideal for simple cases without setup.

### TEST_F
- Test that uses a test fixture to share setup and teardown.
- Provides isolation yet reuse.

### TEST_P (Value-Parameterized Test)
- Enables testing a scenario across multiple data points without code duplication.
- Access parameters via `GetParam()`.

### TYPED_TEST and TYPED_TEST_P (Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests)
- Repeat the same test logic across various types.
- Useful for template or interface compliance testing.

---

## Fixtures, Parameterized, and Typed Tests in Context

- **Fixtures** create clean bases for related tests.
- **Parameterization** lets you run the same test multiple times with different inputs, covering more edge cases efficiently.
- **Typed tests** repeat tests across types, validating templated code.

For example, with a fixture for a `Vector`, you might write a parameterized test that verifies behavior on vectors of different sizes, or a typed test that runs on `int`, `float`, and `double` vector implementations.

---

## Practical Examples of Core Concepts

### Basic Test
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```
- A standalone test verifying a simple factorial case.

### Fixture-Based Tests
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;

  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```
- Demonstrates tests sharing common setup with a fixture.

### Value-Parameterized Test
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, FooTest, testing::Values(0, 2, 4, 6));
```
- Same test runs for each provided parameter.

### Typed Test
```cpp
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

typedef testing::Types<int, double> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, IsZeroInitialized) {
  EXPECT_EQ(TypeParam(), this->value_);
}
```
- Examines different types with the same test logic.

## Essential GoogleTest Macros Overview

| Macro                    | Purpose                                       |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `TEST`                   | Define a simple test function                  |
| `TEST_F`                 | Define a test using a fixture                   |
| `TEST_P`                 | Parameterized test using data values           |
| `TYPED_TEST`             | Typed test for multiple types                   |
| `ASSERT_*`               | Fatal assertions (abort test on failure)      |
| `EXPECT_*`               | Nonfatal assertions (continue on failure)     |
| `EXPECT_THAT`            | Matcher-based assertions                        |
| `SCOPED_TRACE`           | Add context info to failure messages           |
| `GTEST_SKIP()`           | Skip test execution at runtime                  |
| `FRIEND_TEST`            | Grant test access to private class members     |

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Use fixtures when tests share setup**: Avoid code duplication and improve clarity.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` unless test must abort immediately**: This helps catch multiple failures in one run.
- **Use parameterized tests for repetitive input variations**: Saves effort and improves coverage.
- **Make assertions clear and precise**: Custom failure messages or predicate assertions (`EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*`) help diagnose issues faster.
- **Leverage matchers for richer condition checks**: `EXPECT_THAT` with gMock matchers allows expressive, readable tests.
- **Avoid mixing Test and Test_F within same suite**: Consistency helps maintainability.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### Assertion Location and Fatal Failures

- Fatal assertions abort only the current function, not the entire test.
- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or check `HasFatalFailure()` to propagate failures in subroutines.

### Disabled Tests

- Tests or suites starting with `DISABLED_` prefix are not executed.
- Use these for temporarily skipping problematic tests.

### Test Order and Isolation

- Tests run in deterministic but unspecified order by default.
- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize test order to detect inter-test dependencies.
