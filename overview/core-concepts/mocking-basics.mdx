# Introduction to Mocking

## Unlocking Precise and Isolated Testing with GoogleMock

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with GoogleMock to empower C++ developers with robust mocking capabilities. Mocking in GoogleTest allows you to create mock objects—test doubles that simulate real dependencies—to enable focused, behavioral tests that validate interactions between components without relying on complex or unavailable real objects.

Mocking is not just about replacing dependencies; it's about crafting precise expectations and behaviors on mocked methods that mirror your production interfaces, allowing controlled, repeatable, and isolated tests.

### Why Mocking Matters

- **Isolate tested code from external dependencies**: Test your components in isolation, without unpredictable network, filesystem, or hardware access.
- **Verify interaction correctness**: Assert *how* other components and dependencies are used — which methods are called, with what parameters, how often, and in what order.
- **Drive design through interfaces**: Encourage clean design by coding to interfaces that are easily mockable.
- **Facilitate testing failure paths**: Simulate errors or edge conditions in dependencies that are difficult to reproduce naturally.

This page introduces GoogleMock’s integrated mocking features, shows how mock objects work, and highlights how mocks enable precise, isolated C++ testing.

## What Is Mocking with GoogleMock?

### Clear Definition

Mocking in GoogleTest is facilitated by GoogleMock, a C++ mocking framework that generates mock classes allowing you to set expectations on method calls, specify return values or actions, and validate interactions during test execution.

### Core Purpose

GoogleMock lets you:

- Define mock classes that mirror your interfaces.
- Specify which methods should be called, with what arguments, how many times.
- Simulate method behaviors by specifying return values or complex actions.
- Receive immediate feedback when the code under test violates expectations.

Thus, it transforms testing from state-based checks into interaction-based verification, which is crucial when the correctness of your code depends on collaborating components.

### Key Differentiators

- **Declarative Mock Generation:** Simplifying mock creation with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- **Rich Matchers:** Validate method arguments with intuitive predicates.
- **Flexible Expectations & Actions:** Fine control over call counts, orders, and simulated behaviors.
- **Strictness Options:** Choose between “nice,” “naggy,” or “strict” mocks for varying levels of warning verbosity.
- **Support for Overloads and Templates:** Handle overloaded and templated methods naturally.

## How Do Mock Objects Work?

### Creating a Mock Class

You define mock classes by subclassing your interface and using macros such as `MOCK_METHOD` to generate methods with automatic expectation and behavior support. For example:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
   MOCK_METHOD(void, SetName, (const std::string& name), (override));
};
```

Even private or protected methods can be mocked by making the mock method public.

### Setting Expectations

You use `EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(matchers...))` to define expected calls before exercising the code:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, GetSize())
    .Times(3)
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));
```

This expects `GetSize` to be called three times, returning 42 each time.

### Default Behavior and ON_CALL

If you want to specify default behaviors without strict expectations, use `ON_CALL`:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_foo, GetSize())
    .WillByDefault(Return(100));
```

This sets what happens if the method is called without any specific expectation.

### Handling Uninteresting Calls

By default, calls to mock methods without expectations generate warnings. Use `NiceMock<T>` to suppress those warnings, or `StrictMock<T>` to treat them as errors.

### Specialized Mock Types

- `NiceMock<T>` — Mocks that ignore uninteresting calls silently.
- `NaggyMock<T>` — Default behavior; warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock<T>` — Mocks that fail tests on any unexpected calls.

## Key Features & Capabilities

- **Declarative Mock Definitions:** `MOCK_METHOD` macro for concise mock method declarations, supporting qualifiers like `const`, `override`, and calling conventions.

- **Rich Argument Matching:** Use matchers like `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()`, and composite logic to check method call arguments precisely.

- **Flexible Expectation Clauses:** Specify times called (`Times()`), order (`InSequence`), and call count ranges.

- **Actions:** Specify return values (`Return()`), side effects, sequences of actions (`WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`), or delegate calls.

- **Partial & Strict Verification:** Auto-verification on mock destruction and options to verify earlier.

- **Support for Advanced C++ Features:** Mock templates, overloaded methods, methods using move-only types, and methods with complex signatures.

### Real-World Context

For example, you have a class `Database` with methods to query data. You mock `Database` so that:

- Verify the code queries only allowed tables.
- Simulate queries failing or returning controlled rows.
- Check that cleanup or transactions occur correctly.

## Why Should I Care?

### Primary Benefits

- **Robust Tests:** Create easily maintainable tests that focus on the behavior, not complex setup.
- **Fast Feedback:** Immediate detection when interactions deviate from specifications.
- **Cleaner Design:** Encourages modular, interface-driven design through mocking.
- **Broader Test Coverage:** Enables testing error paths and edge conditions.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Dependency Injection:** Replace real dependencies with mocks to isolate units.
2. **Integration Points:** Verify the correct collaboration with external systems.
3. **Simulating Failures:** Introduce faults in dependencies to test resilience.
4. **Legacy Systems:** Mock hard-to-control or unavailable resources.

### Before and After

| Without Mocking | With GoogleMock                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Tests rely on slow or fragile real objects | Tests run quickly with controlled mocks |
| Can't verify interactions precisely | Can assert exact calls and order |
| Hard to simulate failure paths | Easy to simulate error conditions |

## Getting Started Preview

### Quick Start Overview

1. Define your interfaces with virtual methods.
2. Create mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
3. In your tests, instantiate mocks, set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`.
4. Run your tests; GoogleMock verifies interactions automatically.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or above.
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock included in your project.
- Interfaces with virtual methods suitable for mocking.

### Next Steps

- Explore [gMock for Dummies](../guides/getting_started/googlemock-quickstart) for practical examples.
- Define mocks and use expectations with the detailed recipes in the [gMock Cookbook](../docs/gmock_cook_book.md).
- Learn about [matchers](../reference/matchers.md) and [actions](../reference/actions.md) to express expectations precisely.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always mock in the public section, even if the base method is private or protected.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings when uninteresting calls are expected.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behavior and reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying calls.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) to assert call order where meaningful.
- Limit the scope of expectations to maintain test simplicity and robustness.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Unexpected Calls:** Use `StrictMock` or add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`s with `Times(AnyNumber())` when some calls are allowed but not interesting.
- **Ambiguous Overloads:** Help compiler by specifying matchers or use `using` declarations to expose overloads in mocks.
- **Compilation Issues:** Wrap complex argument types with parentheses or create type aliases to avoid parsing errors in `MOCK_METHOD`.

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [Legacy gMock FAQ](../docs/gmock_faq.md).
