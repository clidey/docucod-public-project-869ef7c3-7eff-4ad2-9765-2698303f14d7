# Quick Feature Overview

Welcome to a concise survey of GoogleTest’s major features—your gateway to mastering efficient and effective C++ testing. This page guides you through the essentials: how tests are discovered, how assertions empower validation, the flexibility of parameterized and typed tests, mocking capabilities, and the powerful configuration options that put you in control.

---

## Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests through its simple macros, such as `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`. You write tests in source files, and GoogleTest registers them so they run automatically when you invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

This automation frees you from manual enumeration of tests, ensuring every test you’ve written is executed. With this foundation, you can focus on writing tests rather than managing their execution.

## Assertions

At the heart of GoogleTest lie assertions—macros that check conditions in your test code and determine test success or failure.

- `EXPECT_*` assertions report failures but allow the test to continue, helping identify multiple issues in a single run.
- `ASSERT_*` assertions generate fatal failures, aborting the current test function to prevent further execution when continuing would be meaningless.

These include equality checks, relational comparisons, string and floating-point verifications, and more. For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected); 
ASSERT_TRUE(condition);
```

Use assertions to precisely capture your expected behavior and gain informative failure messages, helping diagnose issues quickly.

## Custom Matchers

Take your assertions further with custom matchers that express complex expectations clearly. Custom matchers enable you to write expressive, reusable predicates that improve the readability and maintainability of your tests.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

### Value-Parameterized Tests

Want to test the same logic against multiple inputs? Value-parameterized tests let you write one test pattern and run it with various parameters.

Define a fixture derived from `TestWithParam<T>`, write your tests with `TEST_P()`, and instantiate them with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`, providing parameter generators such as:

- `Range(begin, end[, step])`
- `Values(v1, v2, ..., vN)`
- `ValuesIn(container)`
- `Bool()` for boolean parameters
- `Combine()` for Cartesian products of parameters

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, DoesBar) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(DoSomething(GetParam()));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyTests, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This technique streamlines testing multiple scenarios without duplicating code.

### Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests

Typed tests run the same test logic over a fixed list of types. You define a class template fixture and associate it with a list of types using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()`. Use `TYPED_TEST()` to write your tests once, and GoogleTest runs them for all specified types.

Type-parameterized tests decouple test code from type list definition, allowing you to define abstract test suites that can be instantiated with different types later.

Examples show how to easily verify interface compliance, test multiple implementations, and increase coverage with less code.

## Mocking Facilities

GoogleTest integrates tightly with GoogleMock, providing a powerful mocking framework. You can:

- Define mock classes to simulate complex behaviors.
- Specify expectations on mock method calls.
- Use actions to define how mocks respond.

This enables isolated unit testing by mimicking dependencies’ behaviors, ensuring tests are fast and focused.

## Configuration Flexibility

GoogleTest offers various flags and environment variables to tailor the test runner’s behavior:

- Select specific tests by name pattern using `--gtest_filter`.
- Run disabled tests with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.
- Generate detailed XML or JSON reports for CI integration.
- Fail fast on first error with `--gtest_fail_fast`.
- Repeat tests, shuffle execution order, and control output formatting.

These capabilities let you customize test execution to fit your workflow seamlessly.

## Where to Find Deeper Guidance

- **Typed and Parameterized Tests:** Detailed in [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](advanced.md) and [docs/primer.md](primer.md).
- **Mocking:** Dive into [Mocking for Dummies](gmock_for_dummies.md), [Mocking Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md), and [Mocking Cheat Sheet](gmock_cheat_sheet.md).
- **Configuration:** Full flag listings in the [Advanced Guide](advanced.md).

### Practical Tips

- Use `EXPECT_*` for checks where multiple failures help identify issues; use `ASSERT_*` when continuation is unsafe.
- Parameterize tests to scale coverage without code duplication.
- Leverage `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context to failures within subroutines.
- Customize test names in parameterized tests for clarity.
- Register your own event listeners to customize output or tracking.

### Common Pitfalls

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent internal name mangling issues.
- Don’t ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` — it signals overall test success.
- If your `SetUp()` is not called, check for spelling and casing errors.

## Code Example: Naming Parameterized Tests

```cpp
class MyTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, HandlesParameters) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

// Instantiate with values 2, 4, and 6
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```

This example shows how easy it is to reuse test logic with varied input values.
