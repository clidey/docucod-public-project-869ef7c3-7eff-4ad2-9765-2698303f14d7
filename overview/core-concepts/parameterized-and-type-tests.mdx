# Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest empowers you to write highly expressive, scalable tests by enabling the reuse of the same test logic across multiple data values or types. This approach dramatically reduces boilerplate, enhances coverage, and ensures consistency across a variety of test scenarios.

---

## Introduction: Why Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests Matter

Picture needing to verify your code against different input values or data structures without rewriting the same test repeatedly. Parameterized tests let you run one test implementation over many values, while type-parameterized tests enable this over types, ensuring your template or generic code behaves correctly across all intended types.

This page demonstrates how GoogleTest makes it straightforward to leverage these powerful features with minimal ceremony.

---

## What Are Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests?

### Parameterized Tests (Value-Parameterized Tests)
These allow you to reuse a test for multiple input values:

- Write a test fixture class derived from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the parameter type.
- Use `TEST_P` to define test cases accessing the current parameter with `GetParam()`.
- Instantiate the test suite with different parameter values using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` and generator functions like `Values()`, `ValuesIn()`, or `Range()`.

**What problem does this solve?**
- Avoids repetitive test code for different input data
- Ensures comprehensive input coverage with less code
- Facilitates data-driven testing patterns

### Type-Parameterized Tests (Typed Tests and Type-Parameterized Tests)
These extend the concept of parameterization from values to types:

- Define a fixture template class derived from `testing::Test` that depends on a type parameter.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` to associate a list of types for which the tests will run, then write tests with `TYPED_TEST`.

**Type-Parameterized Tests** take this further:

- Test logic is defined independently of the type list using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P` (pattern-based).
- Tests are registered with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Then instantiated with concrete types using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`, even across translation units.

**Value that this brings:**
- Verify interface or concept conformance for any number of types.
- Share rigorous test logic across implementations without knowing types up front.

## Core Features and User Workflow

### Parameterized (Value-Parameterized) Tests

- **Fixture Class**: Derive from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`.
- **Test Definitions**: Use `TEST_P` to write tests that use `GetParam()` to access parameters.
- **Instantiation**: Instantiate with parameter sets using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` and parameter generators:
  - `Values(...)` for explicit values
  - `ValuesIn(container)` for ranges or containers
  - `Range(begin, end[, step])` for sequences
  - `Bool()` for Boolean flags
  - `Combine(...)` for Cartesian product of parameters

Example:
```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, FooTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

#### Customizing Test Names
You can supply a function or functor to `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to generate friendly test names based on parameters, which helps in filtering and reporting.

---

### Typed Tests

- **Define a Template Fixture Class** parameterized by type:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};
```

- **Associate Types with Fixture**:
```cpp
using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, char, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(FooTest, MyTypes);
```

- **Write Tests** using `TYPED_TEST`, where `TypeParam` refers to the current type:
```cpp
TYPED_TEST(FooTest, HasDefaultValueZero) {
  TypeParam val = this->value_;
  EXPECT_EQ(val, TypeParam{});
}
```

---

### Type-Parameterized Tests (Pattern-Based)

- Write test patterns with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P` without specifying type list.
- Register tests with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Instantiate anywhere with `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and specify different type lists multiple times.

Example:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class MyTest : public testing::Test {};

TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyTest);

TYPED_TEST_P(MyTest, DoesSomething) { ... }

REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyTest, DoesSomething);

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float>;
INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(Instance1, MyTest, MyTypes);
```

This allows defining abstract test suites reusable by multiple implementations.

## Practical Benefits: Why You Should Care

- **Increased Test Coverage**: Run the same test logic across multiple inputs or types to catch edge cases and regressions.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Write concise tests once, instead of duplicating logic per input or type.
- **Improved Consistency**: Ensures uniform behavior verification across all variants.
- **Scalable Test Maintenance**: Quickly add new types or parameters without code duplication.
- **Better Test Naming and Filtering**: Fine-grained control over test instance names aids debugging and selective runs.

### Common Use Cases

- Testing template classes or functions over different types.
- Verifying algorithm correctness across multiple input datasets.
- Ensuring interface implementations meet contract requirements.
- Running flag combinations and configuration permutations.

### Before and After

| Before                         | After                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Write duplicated tests for each type or value | Single test logic reused over many inputs/types |
| Missed coverage on corner cases | Confident coverage for multiple cases            |
| Harder to maintain and update tests | Easier to extend with new parameters or types     |

## Step-by-Step Getting Started Preview

### Typed Tests Quick Start

1. Define a fixture template class:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_{};
};
```
2. Specify the types:
```cpp
using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);
```
3. Write typed test cases:
```cpp
TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, IsDefaultConstructed) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, TypeParam{});
}
```
4. Compile and run. Each type instantiates a test suite.

### Value-Parameterized Tests Quick Start

1. Define a fixture class deriving from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`:
```cpp
class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};
```
2. Write parameterized tests:
```cpp
TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsPositive) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}
```
3. Instantiate tests with parameters:
```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyInst, MyParamTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```
4. Compile and run.

## Tips, Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Declare `SetUpTestSuite()` as public** when using typed or parameterized tests to avoid access issues.
- **Use type lists (`::testing::Types<>`) instead of raw commas** to avoid parsing errors with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.
- **Always register type-parameterized tests** with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` before instantiating.
- **Name your parameterized test instantiations uniquely** to avoid confusion in test outputs.
- **Avoid underscores in test suite and test names** as GoogleTest filters and naming can be sensitive to them.
- **Use custom naming functors or lambdas** in `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to create readable and unique test names.
- **Suppress uninstantiated test errors** using `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` if you have tests defined but deliberately not instantiated.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Parameterized and Typed Tests">  
<Accordion title="Tests are defined but not instantiated error">
GoogleTest reports missing instantiations for type-parameterized tests.

**Cause:** You need to register tests with `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and instantiate before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

**Solution:** Check that you have both registration and instantiation macros properly placed.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Test parameter names are invalid or duplicated">
Failure about invalid or duplicate parameterized test names.

**Cause:** Custom name generator producing names with invalid characters or duplicates.

**Solution:** Ensure test name suffixes contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores, and are unique within the suite.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Test fixture access specifiers" >
Compilation or runtime errors related to `SetUpTestSuite()` accessibility.

**Cause:** `SetUpTestSuite()` or `TearDownTestSuite()` is not public in your test fixture used with parameterized tests.

**Solution:** Make `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` public in your fixture class.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Missing `GetParam()` in TEST_P">
Errors trying to use `GetParam()` outside a value-parameterized test.

**Cause:** You may be using `GetParam()` in a non-parameterized or typed test.

**Solution:** Use `GetParam()` only inside `TEST_P` tests; for typed tests use `TypeParam` instead.
</Accordion>  
<Accordion title="Parameter generators not producing values">
Tests are instantiated but do not run any parameterized instances.

**Cause:** Parameter generators like `Range()` or `ValuesIn()` might have empty sequences.

**Solution:** Verify the parameter sets are non-empty and valid.
</Accordion>
