## Getting Started With Your First Tests

Starting with GoogleTest is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. Here is a simple workflow to help you move from setup to running your first test:

1. **Install GoogleTest and GoogleMock**
   - Choose your preferred build system such as CMake or Bazel.
   - Follow our dedicated installation instructions (links provided below).

2. **Configure Your Test Project**
   - Integrate GoogleTest into your build environment.
   - Verify your build system can locate and link the necessary libraries.

3. **Write a Basic Test**
   - Use the [GoogleTest Primer](../guides/getting-started/primer) to learn how to write simple, clear test cases.
   - For mocking dependencies or collaborators, explore the [gMock for Dummies](../guides/core-testing-workflows/mocking-basics) guide.

4. **Run and Validate Your Test**
   - Build and execute your test binary.
   - Use the [Validating Your Setup](../../getting-started/initial-setup-usage/validating-setup) guide to troubleshoot common issues.

5. **Explore Advanced Features**
   - Once comfortable, expand your skills by diving into the [Advanced Guide](../guides/advanced-patterns/custom-matchers-actions) or the [Feature Overview](../../overview/architecture-and-concepts/feature-overview) page.

## Practical Tips for Quick Momentum

- **Start simple:** Focus on writing one test at a time.
- **Use provided examples:** Our samples and primer pages offer code you can adapt immediately.
- **Leverage mocking early:** Use GoogleMock to isolate components easily and speed up failure detection.
- **Keep expectations manageable:** Avoid over-specifying tests, which can cause brittleness.

## What’s Next?

After you complete your first test run, consider these next steps to build expertise:

- Dive into detailed testing strategies with the [GoogleTest Primer](/guides/getting-started/primer).
- Learn mocking fundamentals with the [gMock for Dummies](/guides/core-testing-workflows/mocking-basics).
- Explore test assertions and matcher flexibility in [Writing Effective Assertions](/guides/core-testing-workflows/writing-assertions) and [Using Matchers for Flexible Verification](/guides/core-testing-workflows/using-matchers).

This approach ensures your learning curve remains balanced—building confidence before complexity.
