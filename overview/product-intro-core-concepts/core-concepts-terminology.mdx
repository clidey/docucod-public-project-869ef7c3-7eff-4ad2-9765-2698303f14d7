# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Understanding the Language of GoogleTest

To fully leverage GoogleTest for C++ unit testing, it's essential to grasp its key concepts and terminology. This guide clarifies important terms such as **test case**, **test fixture**, **assertion**, **death test**, and **parameterized tests**. It also explains how GoogleTest organizes tests following the xUnit framework principles and demystifies language like 'fatal' and 'non-fatal' failures to help you better design, write, and interpret tests.

---

## What Is a Test Case?

A **test case** refers to a grouping of tests that share a common setup or context. In GoogleTest, this is often represented either as a single test or a suite of related tests that exercise different parts of the functionality under test. Informally, think of a test case as a named bundle of tests that verify related behaviors.

---

## What Is a Test Fixture?

A **test fixture** in GoogleTest provides a way to reuse common setup and teardown code across multiple tests. It is a C++ class derived from `::testing::Test` that holds the shared objects, variables, and helper functions necessary for multiple related tests.

- **Purpose:** Create a consistent environment so tests can focus on verifying behavior without duplicating setup code.
- **Usage:** Each test using the fixture inherits the setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) logic automatically.

For example, if you are testing a class `Calculator`, a test fixture might initialize a `Calculator` instance reused across individual test methods.

---

## What Is an Assertion?

An **assertion** is a statement that checks if a condition holds true during test execution. Assertions determine test success or failure. 

GoogleTest provides various assertion macros, such as `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_TRUE()`, and `EXPECT_THROW()`. 

- **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`)** halt the current test immediately upon failure.
- **Non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`)** report the failure but allow the test to continue.

Understanding when to use fatal versus non-fatal assertions will help make tests more robust and informative.

---

## What Is a Death Test?

A **death test** verifies that a program terminates or crashes under specific conditions. It helps confirm that your code fails gracefully or asserts as expected in fatal error conditions.

GoogleTest provides mechanisms to write death tests that spawn subprocesses and monitor for expected exit conditions, like crashing or calling `exit()`.

Death tests are useful for validating code that must terminate given illegal state or invalid input, ensuring safety and correctness.

---

## What Are Parameterized Tests?

**Parameterized tests** allow you to write a single test logic executed repeatedly with different input values. This reduces code duplication while increasing coverage.

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests where inputs are provided as tuples or arrays, and the test receives different parameters each run.

For example, testing a sorting algorithm across various input sequences can be done elegantly with parameterized tests.

---

## How Does GoogleTest Structure Tests? What Does "xUnit-based" Mean?

GoogleTest adopts the **xUnit** family pattern, a widely used standard for unit testing frameworks:

- Tests are grouped in **test cases** or **test suites**
- Each test is an independent method that runs with pre- and post-conditions
- Assertions signal success or failure
- Test fixtures provide consistent setup and teardown

This familiar structure helps developers reason about tests naturally and transfer knowledge from other frameworks like JUnit or NUnit.

---

## Understanding Failures: Fatal vs. Non-Fatal

In GoogleTest:

- **Fatal failures** (`ASSERT_*` macros) stop execution of the current test immediately since further checks would be invalid or meaningless.
- **Non-fatal failures** (`EXPECT_*` macros) log the failure but allow the test to continue running to report multiple issues in a single pass.

Use fatal failures when subsequent test operations depend on the checked condition being true, and non-fatal ones when independent conditions can be verified in one run.

---

## Putting It All Together: A Real-World Test Structure Example

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator_ = new Calculator();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    delete calculator_;
  }

  Calculator* calculator_;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AdditionWorks) {
  ASSERT_EQ(calculator_->Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, DivisionByZeroDies) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(calculator_->Divide(10, 0), "division by zero");
}

class CalculatorParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<int, int, int>> {
};

TEST_P(CalculatorParamTest, AddsCorrectly) {
  int a, b, expected;
  std::tie(a, b, expected) = GetParam();
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(a, b), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    AdditionTests,
    CalculatorParamTest,
    ::testing::Values(
        std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3),
        std::make_tuple(-1, 1, 0),
        std::make_tuple(100, 200, 300))
);
```

This example showcases the use of test fixtures for shared setup (`CalculatorTest`), death tests for ensuring correct failure (`DivisionByZeroDies`), and parameterized tests (`CalculatorParamTest`) for checking addition with multiple inputs.

## Tips, Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- Prefer **test fixtures** to duplicate setup code across tests.
- Choose **`ASSERT_*`** when failure invalidates further checks; use **`EXPECT_*`** to check multiple conditions per test.
- Use **death tests** judiciously to verify program termination scenarios.
- Leverage **parameterized tests** to reduce redundancy when testing functions with multiple input sets.
- Understand the **xUnit** approach to intuitively organize and interpret tests.
- Avoid overly strict expectations; write tests that check the contract rather than implementation details.
- Remember that **fatal failures** stop test execution while **non-fatal** do not.
