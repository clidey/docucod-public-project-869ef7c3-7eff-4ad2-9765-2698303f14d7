# Key Concepts & Terminology

GoogleTest provides a strong foundation for writing reliable and maintainable C++ tests by introducing several core concepts. Understanding these key terms and how they fit together is essential for effective test development.

---

## Tests

A **test** is a piece of code written to verify an aspect of your program's behavior. In GoogleTest, tests are organized as functions annotated with macros such as `TEST` or within test fixtures. The goal of a test is to automatically confirm that the code behaves correctly under specified conditions.

## Assertions

**Assertions** are statements inside tests that verify certain conditions. If an assertion fails, the test fails and reports the problem. GoogleTest provides a variety of assertions:

- `EXPECT_` assertions continue the test after failure, allowing multiple checks per test.
- `ASSERT_` assertions abort the test when they fail.

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value);  // Checks equality but continues on failure
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr);         // Fails and aborts the test immediately
```

Assertions are the primary mechanism by which test expectations are verified.

## Fixtures

A **test fixture** is a class that provides a common environment for multiple related tests. It sets up initial conditions and cleans up after tests run. Using fixtures allows shared setup and teardown code, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and test clarity.

Basic flow with fixtures:

1. **Setup:** Code to prepare test environment (`SetUp()` method).
2. **Test body:** The test logic itself.
3. **Teardown:** Cleanup code (`TearDown()` method).

Example minimum fixture definition:

```cpp
class MyClassTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* prepare data or state */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* cleanup */ }
};

TEST_F(MyClassTest, DoesSomething) {
  // Test code here
}
```

## Mocks

**Mocks** are specialized test doubles that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way. They allow you to:

- Verify the interactions your code has with dependencies.
- Specify expected calls, their arguments, and return values.

In GoogleTest, mocking is supported through GoogleMock (gMock), which enables defining mock classes with mock methods, setting expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) and default behaviors (`ON_CALL`).

Mocks enhance the ability to perform fine-grained testing of component interactions beyond observable outcomes alone.

## Matchers

**Matchers** express constraints on function call arguments in expectations. They define conditions that arguments should meet when mock methods are invoked.

Matchers allow flexible argument verification, typically used inside `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL`, for example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;       // Matches any value
using ::testing::Ge;      // Matches values greater than or equal to

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(5)));   // Expects Foo() with argument >= 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(_));        // Expects Bar() with any argument
```

Matchers support composition, predicate functions, and custom definitions enabling expressive, readable expectations.

## How These Fit Together

Here is how you typically use these concepts together:

1. Define or obtain an interface you want to test against.
2. Create a Mock class that implements this interface using GoogleMock macros.
3. In your test, create mock objects.
4. Use **matchers** inside `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expected arguments to methods.
5. Use **assertions** to verify outcomes.
6. Organize shared setup inside **fixtures** for related tests.

This allows you to:

- Isolate your tests from real implementations.
- Precisely control method call expectations and behaviors.
- Verify interaction between components clearly.

## Practical Examples

### Basic Mocking Example

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX()).WillOnce(Return(0));

  // Your code that uses Turtle goes here...
}
```

### Using Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GoTo(50, _));  // Expects x coordinate 50 and any y.
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(Ge(100)));  // Forward at least 100 units.
```

### Using Fixtures

```cpp
class TurtleTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    turtle_ = new MockTurtle();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    delete turtle_;
  }

  MockTurtle* turtle_;
};

TEST_F(TurtleTest, PenUpCalled) {
  EXPECT_CALL(*turtle_, PenUp());
  turtle_->PenUp();
}
```

## Troubleshooting and Tips

- **Assertion failures:** Review the expectations and the actual calls. Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to show detailed call logs.
- **Uninteresting calls warnings:** These happen when mock methods are called with no expectations. You can suppress these by using `NiceMock` or by adding expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- **Overloaded methods:** Use `MOCK_METHOD` carefully for overloaded methods, and consider using `using` declarations to avoid hiding base class methods.
- **Matchers must be pure:** Matchers cannot have side effects nor depend on external mutable state.
