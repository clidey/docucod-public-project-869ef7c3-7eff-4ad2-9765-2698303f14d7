# Key Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to the foundational page where we define the essential terms and ideas that you will encounter throughout GoogleTest and GoogleMock documentation. This page establishes the mental map you need before diving into code, APIs, or advanced workflows — helping you understand how concepts connect and why they matter.

---

## What You Will Learn Here

- The meaning and role of *Assertions*, *Test Cases*, and *Test Fixtures* in structuring your tests.
- The purpose and functionality of *Matchers*, *Actions*, and *Cardinalities* for controlling and validating test behavior.
- What *Mocks* are, their varying *Strictness Levels*, and how they integrate into your test workflows.
- How these concepts fit together into typical user flows to help you achieve reliable, maintainable, and expressive tests.

## Assertions: The Heartbeat of Test Verification

At the core of every test is an *assertion*. Assertions are statements that verify whether your code behaves as expected.

- GoogleTest provides various assertion macros starting with `EXPECT_` (non-fatal, test continues after failure) and `ASSERT_` (fatal, test aborts immediately on failure).
- Assertions check conditions such as equality, comparison, or custom predicates.
- They report failures with detailed information, including file, line number, and custom messages, facilitating quick and focused debugging.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Check if function returned expected value";
```


## Test Cases, Test Suites, and Test Fixtures: Organizing Your Tests

Terminology can be confusing, so here’s how GoogleTest organizes tests:

| Concept           | Meaning and Role                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test**          | A single scenario or function check (a test function).|
| **Test Suite**    | A group of related tests, often sharing common setup. |
| **Test Fixture**  | A class that encapsulates shared test data and setup/teardown code for tests in a suite.

### Structuring Tests:

- Each `TEST()` defines an independent test function.
- `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` runs the test with access to fixture setup.
- Fixtures ensure repeatable, isolated test environments and reduce duplication.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MyFeatureTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* common setup */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* cleanup */ }
  int shared_resource;
};

TEST_F(MyFeatureTest, HandlesInputX) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_resource > 0);
}
```


## Matchers: Describing Expected Arguments Clearly

Matchers define the criteria mock functions expect for their parameters.

- They work like predicates that can match exact values, or more complex conditions (e.g., ranges, patterns).
- The wildcard matcher `_` allows any value.
- Matchers can be combined to form rich conditions (e.g., `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`).

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Foo(Ge(10), StartsWith("test")));
```

This expects calls to `Foo()` where the first argument is greater or equal to 10 and the second argument starts with "test".


## Actions: Defining Mock Behavior

While assertions verify behavior, *actions* define what a mock does when called.

- Actions include returning values, invoking callbacks, modifying arguments, or invoking real implementations.
- You specify actions with clauses like `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, or default actions via `ON_CALL()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(42))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(0));
```


## Cardinalities: Controlling Call Frequency

Cardinalities specify how many times you expect a mock function to be called.

- Examples include `Times(1)`, `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)`, `Between(m, n)`, or `AnyNumber()`.
- Cardinalities balance strictness: too strict can cause brittle tests, too loose can hide bugs.

Omitting cardinalities lets GoogleMock infer them intelligently based on action clauses.


## Mocks and Strictness Levels: Managing Expectations Robustly

Mocks replace real object behavior in tests to observe and control interactions.

### Types of Mocks by Strictness:

- **NaggyMock (default):** Warns on uninteresting calls (calls without expectations).
- **NiceMock:** Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, making tests quieter.
- **StrictMock:** Treats uninteresting calls as errors, enforcing precise expectations.

### Choosing the Right Strictness:

- Use **NiceMock** for relaxed, maintainable tests.
- Use **StrictMock** when you want to strictly verify every interaction.
- NaggyMock is an intermediate, providing warnings but allowing flexibility.

**Example of Declaring Strict Mocks:**
```cpp
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
EXPECT_CALL(strict_mock, DoThis());
```


## How These Concepts Fit Into Your Workflow

1. Define test suites and fixtures to organize tests with shared context.
2. Write assertions in tests to verify results and states.
3. For dependencies needing control, create mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
4. Specify expectations on mocks using `EXPECT_CALL`, defining *matchers*, *actions*, and *cardinalities*.
5. Run tests and rely on GoogleTest/GoogleMock to automatically verify all expectations.

This semantic structure allows you to write expressive, maintainable tests that clearly specify *what* you expect and *how* mocks will behave.


## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- Always set expectations **before** exercising the mock objects.
- Use `ON_CALL` to define default behaviors without expectations.
- Avoid over-specification to keep tests resilient to refactoring.
- Leverage sequences (`InSequence` and `Sequence`) to enforce call orders where necessary.
- Be aware of sticky expectations: use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to disable expectations after usage.
- Remember to mock only virtual functions or relevant interfaces; avoid mocking private members directly.
