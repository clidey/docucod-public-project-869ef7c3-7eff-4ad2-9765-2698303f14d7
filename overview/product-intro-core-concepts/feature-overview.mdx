# Feature Overview

GoogleTest equips C++ developers with a comprehensive suite of testing capabilities designed to improve code quality, ease of use, and automation. This feature snapshot guides you through the core capabilities that make GoogleTest an exceptional choice in the space of unit testing, ensuring your tests are expressive, maintainable, and integrate smoothly in your development workflow.

## Automatic Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest discovers and runs tests automatically, removing the overhead of manual test registration.

- Write test cases anywhere in your project.
- GoogleTest scans the executable, identifies all test cases, and runs them.
- Supports running specific tests or test suites via command-line filters.

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

Run all tests automatically or filter on `MathTest.Addition`.

## Wide Range of Assertions

Assertions are the heart of verifying correctness. GoogleTest provides:

- Basic assertions like `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_TRUE()`, `EXPECT_NE()`.
- Rich failure reporting that shows the exact expression values.
- Non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) and fatal (`ASSERT_*`) assertions giving fine control over test flow.

**Example:**

```cpp
EXPECT_NE(result, nullptr);  // Test continues on failure
ASSERT_GT(size, 0);        // Test aborts on failure
```

## Support for Custom and Parameterized Tests

To maximize reusability and coverage:

- Parameterized tests enable running the same test logic over multiple inputs,
  reducing boilerplate and increasing coverage.
- Custom test fixtures allow shared setup and teardown,
  improving maintainability.

**Parameterized test example:**

```cpp
class PrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(PrimeTest, IsPrime) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PrimeValues, PrimeTest, ::testing::Values(2,3,5,7));
```

## Handling of Fatal and Non-Fatal Failures

GoogleTest distinguishes between assertion failures that should stop the
current test immediately (fatal) and those that can be recorded while continuing
execution (non-fatal). This balance allows flexible test designs:

- Use fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) for prerequisites that make subsequent steps invalid if failed.
- Use non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) to verify multiple conditions in the same test.

## Extensive Mocking Support via GoogleMock Integration

GoogleTest fully integrates with GoogleMock, enhancing testing of interactions:

- Define mock classes quickly with intuitive macros.
- Set flexible expectations on method calls, argument values, call sequences, and cardinalities.
- Specify default behaviors or expectations, helping simulate complex environments.
- Supports strict, nice, and naggy mock behavior modes to match your test discipline.

**Simple mock example:**

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), (const));
};

TEST(FooTest, ReturnsValue) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(Return(10));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(), 10);
}
```

## Flexible Test Running Options

GoogleTest supports various configurations in how you run your tests, optimizing for your CI/CD pipeline or local development:

- Run all tests or selectively run subsets with filters.
- Control test repetitions and time-outs.
- Initialize test environment with custom global setup and teardown.
- Supports death tests to verify program behavior under fatal errors.

## Why This Matters to You

GoogleTest streamlines the creation, execution, and maintenance of automated tests in C++. You save time by avoiding manual test registration, gain confidence through robust assertions and expressive failure output, and achieve full control over your test scenarios including complex interaction testing with mocks.

Whether you are starting with simple unit tests or advancing into detailed interaction and parameterized scenarios, GoogleTest's features align with your evolving testing needs.
