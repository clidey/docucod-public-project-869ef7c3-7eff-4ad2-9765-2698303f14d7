# Supported Platforms & Compatibility

GoogleTest is designed to run your C++ tests reliably across a broad range of platforms, compilers, and environments. This page provides a clear and authoritative overview of the officially supported platforms and compatibility policies to help your team quickly assess whether GoogleTest fits your development ecosystem.

---

## Why Platform Compatibility Matters

When adopting a testing framework like GoogleTest, knowing the exact environment it supports is critical. Platform and compiler compatibility ensures smooth integration, predictable behavior, and reduced maintenance overhead. GoogleTest strictly follows Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) to maintain broad, stable support.

By reviewing this page, you can avoid runtime surprises, compilation errors, and incompatibilities early—saving valuable engineering time.

## Officially Supported Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide variety of operating systems including but not limited to:

- Linux (including various distributions and Android)
- Windows (desktop versions, MinGW)
- Mac OS X and iOS
- BSD variants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD)
- Other UNIX-like systems (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX)

This compatibility harnesses platform detection macros defined internally ([`gtest-port-arch.h`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port-arch.h)) that tailor GoogleTest functionality based on the detected environment.


## Supported Compiler Versions

GoogleTest requires an environment supporting at least C++17. It is rigorously tested with many major compilers including:

- GCC (minimum version varies by platform but generally recent releases supporting C++17)
- Clang/LLVM
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and newer
- Intel LLVM Compiler

For a detailed and up-to-date list, consult the [Google foundational C++ support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md), which outlines compiler versions, platform support, and build tool compatibility.

## Build and Integration Environments

GoogleTest provides first-class support for the following build systems:

- **CMake:** The primary and recommended method with versatile cross-platform support. GoogleTest ships with its own `CMakeLists.txt` allowing simple standalone builds or seamless incorporation into existing projects.

- **Bazel:** Supported as an alternative, especially within large monorepos or projects already using Bazel.

- **Manual Build:** GoogleTest’s source files can be directly compiled and linked if needed, but this is less common.

- **Pkg-config:** For automated flag management and integration in complex toolchains, GoogleTest supplies pkg-config files facilitating smooth compiler and linker configuration.


## Platform-Specific Considerations

- **Thread Safety:** GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms that provide POSIX pthreads support. On other systems (such as Windows), some threading features are limited.

- **Shared Libraries (DLLs):** While GoogleTest is typically built as a static library for simplicity, it supports dynamic linking with compiler flags that you need to explicitly enable.

- **Macro Name Clashes:** To avoid conflicts with other libraries, GoogleTest allows renaming its macros via compiler definitions.

- **Stream Capturing and Death Tests:** Features like output capturing and death tests depend on platform capabilities and may have limitations on embedded or mobile platforms.


## How to Confirm Platform Compatibility

1. Visit Google’s [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).
2. Check the [Compiler/Platform/Build Tool Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for your exact development environment.
3. Use GoogleTest’s internal platform macros (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`) to conditionally adjust tests if necessary.


## Practical Tips for Users

- **Use CMake for Best Cross-Platform Experience:** GoogleTest's CMake integration automatically handles platform quirks such as POSIX threads and Windows runtime linking.

- **Set C++ Standard to 17 or Later:** Ensure your build environment uses C++17 or newer as GoogleTest requires this.

- **Enable Pthreads if Available:** On POSIX systems, pthread libraries enable full thread-safety. CMake scripts detect and link these automatically.

- **Check for Known Limitations:** Some platforms may have incomplete support for features like death tests or stream redirection—check your platform’s macros to adapt accordingly.

- **Leverage Macro Configuration:** Use compiler macros like `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to customize your build for your platform’s specifics.
