# Supported Platforms & Compatibility

## Overview

Understanding the platforms, compilers, and toolchains supported by GoogleTest is essential to ensure seamless integration and smooth testing workflows within your development stack. This page summarizes the officially supported environments and highlights key compatibility considerations, linking directly to the canonical support matrix maintained by Google. By clarifying these parameters, users can quickly assess whether GoogleTest fits their platform and tooling requirements, avoiding integration pitfalls early on.

---

## What Is Covered on This Page?

This documentation page focuses explicitly on the breadth of supported platforms, the compatibility with common C++ compilers, and toolchain environment constraints for GoogleTest:

- Supported operating systems and platform environments
- Compatible compilers and minimum C++ standard requirements
- Toolchains and build system integrations
- Standard compliance guarantees
- Links to the official support matrix for detailed, current platform data

Unlike general product overviews, this page delves into practical compatibility details that help you confirm GoogleTest runs reliably in your ecosystem.

## Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to be highly portable, reflecting Google's commitment to cross-platform C++ testing. It follows the [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and currently supports a broad set of platforms including but not limited to:

- **Linux** (desktop and server distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, Windows Store App environments)
- **macOS** (including recent versions with Xcode support)
- **BSD variants** (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD)
- **Other Unix platforms** (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS)

The comprehensive list is regularly maintained and available [here in the official compatibility matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Key Platform Notes

- **Linux Android:** Supported with limitations starting from API 9.
- **iOS:** Supported on Apple’s mobile platform.
- **Windows:** Different editions including desktop and MinGW environments are supported.

## Compiler and C++ Standard Requirements

GoogleTest requires an environment supporting **C++17** or later, aligning with modern C++ standards for improved language features and performance reliability.

### Supported Compilers

- **GCC** 7.0 and above
- **Clang/LLVM** with C++17 support
- **Microsoft Visual Studio** 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
- **Intel C++ Compiler** with proper C++17 compliance

Setting the C++ standard version is critical and typically done by configuring your build toolchain, for example, using CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

This ensures successful builds and prevents subtle runtime or compilation issues due to mismatched language versions.

## Build System and Toolchain Integration

GoogleTest offers native support for CMake, enabling smooth integration into various build environments and workflows:

- **Standalone builds:** Easily clone and build GoogleTest as a standalone project using CMake.
- **Subdirectory add:** Incorporate GoogleTest source directly into your project’s CMake build tree via `add_subdirectory()`, ensuring consistent compiler and linker settings.
- **Find Package:** Use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` to consume installed GoogleTest libraries and headers.

This flexibility facilitates cross-platform builds while maintaining consistent behavior.

### Special Considerations

- On **Windows with Visual Studio**, GoogleTest's default static linkage runtime libraries may conflict with your project settings. Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align runtime linkage.
- In **multi-threaded environments**, where pthread support exists, GoogleTest enables thread safety. For platforms lacking automatic pthread detection, define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` explicitly.
- Building GoogleTest as a **shared library (DLL on Windows)** requires additional compiler flags (`-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1`) and linker configuration.

---

## Ecosystem Compatibility

GoogleTest’s design emphasizes compatibility with a wide range of development ecosystems:

- Supports building and running tests on various continuous integration platforms.
- Works with most popular IDEs and debuggers across supported platforms.
- Seamlessly integrates with GoogleMock (gMock) for mocking capabilities.

---

## Benefits of Compatibility Awareness

By using GoogleTest within supported environments, you gain:

- Reliable, repeatable testing without environment-induced flakiness.
- Access to advanced features like death tests and typed tests across supported OSes.
- Assurance that your tests will run consistently in different compiler toolchains.
- Reduced build and linkage issues by following recommended integration methods.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always verify your compiler meets the minimum C++17 requirement.
- Use CMake as your primary build system to leverage default integration scripts and avoid manual configuration errors.
- Check the [official support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) periodically for updates.
- If targeting non-standard or embedded platforms, prepare to adjust control macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` to match your environment.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Build Failures Due to Unsupported Compiler">
If your compiler does not support C++17, the build will fail. Upgrade your compiler or adjust your build environment to a compatible version.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime Crashes on Unsupported Platforms">
Running GoogleTest on unsupported or partially supported platforms may cause crashes or unstable behavior. Confirm platform support before deployment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linking Errors on Windows with Runtime Library Mismatch">
Ensure `gtest_force_shared_crt` is set appropriately when building GoogleTest alongside Visual Studio projects using dynamic CRT linkage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Thread Safety Problems When Pthreads Not Detected">
Explicitly set `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` based on your platform’s thread capability to avoid errors related to multi-threading.
</Accordion>
