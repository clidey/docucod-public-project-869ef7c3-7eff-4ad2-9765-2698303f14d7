# Feature Highlights

GoogleTest provides a rich, versatile framework for C++ testing, enabling developers to write clear, maintainable, and powerful tests. This page highlights the key features of GoogleTest that solve core testing challenges, from simple unit tests to advanced mocking and parameterized tests.

## Comprehensive xUnit-style Testing Framework

GoogleTest is built around the xUnit testing style, familiar to many developers. You can rapidly define test cases and test suites using simple macros, minimizing boilerplate code.

- **Test discovery and auto-registration:** Simply write tests with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros, and GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs them.
- **Rich assertions:** Over 50 assertion macros let you verify conditions with precise diagnostics on failure.
- **Test fixtures:** Share common setup and teardown logic across related tests, improving organization and reuse.

### Example
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, SquareRoot) {
  double val = std::sqrt(4.0);
  EXPECT_EQ(val, 2.0);
}
```

## Flexible Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest empowers you to write tests once and run them for multiple data sets or types:

- **Parameterized tests:** Easily test the same logic with a variety of inputs, reducing duplication.
- **Typed tests and type-parameterized tests:** Validate templated code across many types within a consistent framework.

This leads to thorough test coverage with less code.

## Customizable and Extensible Test Runners

GoogleTest supports:

- Fine-grained control over which tests to run using filters.
- Custom event listeners for integrating with build systems or CI workflows.
- Support for test sharding, repeat runs, and seed control for flaky tests.

This flexibility eases integration and scaling.

## Robust and Expressive Assertion Suite

Assertions are at the heart of testing. GoogleTest provides:

- **Boolean assertions:** `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`, etc.
- **Equality and relational assertions:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, etc., with detailed diff output on failure.
- **String and container assertions:** Specialized macros like `EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`, and container element matchers.
- **Exception and death test support:** Verify expected failures and abnormal program termination behavior.

The expressive syntax allows pinpointing failures quickly.

## Seamless Mocking Support via GoogleMock Integration

GoogleTest tightly integrates with GoogleMock (gMock), providing:

- Declarative syntax for defining mock classes and methods.
- Powerful expectations and matchers to specify call argument constraints.
- Customizable actions to specify mock method behaviors (returning values, setting output parameters, throwing exceptions).
- Support for sequences and ordering constraints to test call sequences precisely.

This makes it straightforward to mock dependencies and write interaction-focused tests.

### Example of Mocking
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (int key), (const));
};

TEST(FooTest, ReturnsValue) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue(42)).WillOnce(Return(100));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(42), 100);
}
```

## Why GoogleTest Matters

Using GoogleTest significantly accelerates test development, simplifies maintenance, and promotes designs that are easier to test. By supporting both state and interaction testing styles (through GoogleMock), it provides comprehensive tools for C++ developers to ensure code reliability.

## Getting Started Preview

- Write your first test by including `<gtest/gtest.h>` and using the `TEST()` macro.
- Define mocks with `<gmock/gmock.h>` and the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL()` to set expectations on mocks.
- Run tests using the provided test runner or integrate into your build system.
