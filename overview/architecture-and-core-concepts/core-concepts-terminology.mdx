# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms and concepts used by GoogleTest is essential for mastering effective test writing. This page clearly defines key terminology like test cases, assertions, fixtures, mocks, death tests, parameterized tests, and cardinalities, detailing their role in structuring and composing your tests. By grasping these core ideas, new users can write robust, maintainable, and scalable test suites.

---

## Introduction to Core Testing Concepts

Every test you write with GoogleTest builds upon a shared vocabulary. Knowing this vocabulary lets you write tests that are not only correct but also expressive and easy to maintain.

We'll explore each key term, focusing on what you want to achieve as a test author and how these concepts help you structure your tests effectively.

---

## Test Cases and Test Methods

- **Test Case:** Groups related tests usually focused on a particular class or functionality.
- **Test (Test Method):** An individual test scenario verifying one specific aspect of behavior.

Together these let you logically organize your tests for clarity and management.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(MyClassTest, DoesThisCorrectly) {
  MyClass m;
  EXPECT_TRUE(m.DoesThis());
}
```
This defines a test named `DoesThisCorrectly` inside the `MyClassTest` case.

---

## Assertions: Verifying Outcomes

Assertions are the checks within tests that validate behavior. GoogleTest provides two main categories:

- **EXPECT_ Assertions:** Continue test execution after a failure.
- **ASSERT_ Assertions:** Abort the current test on failure.

### Why This Matters
Use `EXPECT_` when you want to see multiple failures in one run. Use `ASSERT_` when failure makes further test steps meaningless.

### Common Assertions
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` — Check equality.
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` — Check condition.
- `ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr)` — Assert pointer is not null.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(42, result);
ASSERT_TRUE(ptr != nullptr);
```

---

## Fixtures: Shared Test Setup and Teardown

Fixtures allow you to share setup and teardown logic across tests, avoiding duplication and ensuring consistent test environments.

- Define a fixture class derived from `::testing::Test`.
- Define `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for preparation and cleanup.
- Write multiple tests using the fixture.

### Example

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialization
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
  }

  MyClass obj;
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test1) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(obj.IsReady());
}
```

## Mocks: Controlling and Verifying Interactions with Dependencies

Mocks let you replace real objects in your tests with controllable, observable substitutes. They let you define:

- Expected method calls
- Specific return values or side effects
- Invocation cardinalities and order

GoogleMock, integrated with GoogleTest, provides powerful mocking support via:

- `MOCK_METHOD` macros to declare mock methods.
- `EXPECT_CALL` to set expectations with detailed behavior.
- Types like `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control handling of uninteresting calls.

### Example

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n), (override));
};

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5)).WillOnce(Return(10));
```

---

## Death Tests: Testing Fatal Failures

Death tests verify that your code handles fatal errors as expected (e.g., assertions, crashes).

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH` macros.
- Run the code expected to cause termination inside the test.
- Verify error messages or conditions.

This is critical for testing failure modes safely without terminating the test process.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ CrashFunction(); }, "expected error message");
```

---

## Parameterized Tests: Running the Same Test with Different Inputs

Parameterized tests enable you to run identical test logic on multiple sets of data with:

- Template-based or typed test fixtures.
- Value parameterization for diverse inputs.

This avoids duplication and improves coverage.

### Example

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, Runs) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, MyParamTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

---

## Cardinalities: Specifying How Many Times a Call Is Expected

Cardinalities control *how many times* a mock method call is expected:

- `Times(Exactly(n))` — Exactly n times.
- `Times(AtLeast(n))` — At least n times.
- `Times(AtMost(n))` — At most n times.
- `Times(AnyNumber())` — Any number of times.

Correct cardinality specification avoids unexpected failures or missed verifications.

### Example

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo()).Times(AtLeast(1));
```

---

## Putting Concepts into Practice: Writing Structured Tests

A typical user flow leveraging these core primitives looks like:

1. Define test cases and methods with clear names reflecting behavior.
2. Use fixtures to initialize test state reused across tests.
3. Use assertions (`EXPECT_` / `ASSERT_`) to check results precisely.
4. Mock dependencies with `MOCK_METHOD` and specify expectations.
5. Use parameterized tests when testing multiple inputs.
6. Verify interaction cardinalities and call order if needed.
7. Use death tests to assert error handling.

This structured approach makes tests reliable, maintainable, and expressive.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Avoid over-specifying mock call counts, which make tests brittle.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on irrelevant method calls.
- Prefer `EXPECT_` assertions when you want multiple checks per test.
- Retire expectations with `.RetiresOnSaturation()` in sequences to avoid sticky matching issues.
- Always set expectations before invoking code under test to avoid undefined behavior.
- Use parameterized tests to reduce duplication.
