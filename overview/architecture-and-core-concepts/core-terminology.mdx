# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Getting Acquainted with Essential Testing Terms

Welcome to the foundational page where we define and demystify key terms that every GoogleTest user must master. This guide unlocks your ability to navigate the framework confidently by linking terminology directly to practical features and typical developer workflows.

---

## What Are These Terms and Why Do They Matter?

GoogleTest provides powerful abstractions to write and organize tests efficiently. Understanding the core concepts like *test cases*, *test fixtures*, *assertions*, *mocks*, *matchers*, *parameterized tests*, and *death tests* is pivotal to leveraging GoogleTest's full power:

- **Test Case (Test Suite)**: A logical grouping of related tests. Think of it as a container that holds multiple test scenarios sharing common setup or purpose.

- **Test Fixture**: A reusable setup environment for a group of tests within a test case. It enables you to write code that runs before and after tests to prepare and clean up the test context.

- **Assertions**: Statements that verify expected conditions in tests. They come in forms like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, which check outcomes and mark tests as failed when expectations are unmet.

- **Mocks and Fake Objects**: Specialized objects created to simulate real dependencies, allowing you to verify interactions and control behavior.

- **Matchers**: Expressive constructs used in assertions and mocks to specify criteria for values or function arguments.

- **Parameterized Tests**: Tests run multiple times with different inputs, improving coverage with less code repetition.

- **Death Tests**: Tests designed to verify that your program exits or behaves correctly under fatal error conditions (e.g., checking that a function crashes when given invalid input).

Each term ties to key features, streamlining communication, enhancing productivity, and fostering the best practices in test design.

## Core Concepts Defined and Connected to Features

### Test Case / Test Suite
- **Definition**: A test suite groups together individual tests (called test methods) that usually test the same functionality or component.
- **Feature Link**: All tests declared with `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` belong to a test suite, enabling better organization and selective execution.

### Test Fixture
- **Definition**: A C++ class that defines shared setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) logic for multiple tests.
- **Benefit**: Avoid duplication in preparation/cleanup tasks.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
  protected:
    void SetUp() override {
      // common setup code here
    }
    void TearDown() override {
      // cleanup code here
    }
  };

  TEST_F(MyFixture, ExampleTest) {
    // test code here
  }
  ```

### Assertions
- **Definition**: The statements that check if your code behaves as expected.
- **Example**: `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)` tests if values are equal, reporting failure without stopping the test.
- **Usage Tip**: Use `ASSERT_` macros for critical failures stopping the test, and `EXPECT_` macros to report failures but continue.

### Mocks & Mock Methods
- **Definition**: Mocks imitate interfaces or classes to verify interactions (which methods get called, with what arguments, how often).
- **Example usage**:
  ```cpp
  class MockDatabase {
  public:
    MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  };

  MockDatabase db;
  EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect()).Times(1);
  ```

### Matchers
- **Definition**: Predicates used inside assertions or mock expectations to precisely specify expected values or states.
- **Common matchers**:
  - `Eq(value)`: Equal to `value`
  - `Not(value)`: Not equal to `value`
  - `HasSubstr("string")`: Contains `string`
- **Example**: `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(HasSubstr("pattern")));`

### Parameterized Tests
- **Purpose**: Run the same test logic multiple times with different parameters.
- **Example snippet**:
  ```cpp
  class FooParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

  TEST_P(FooParamTest, HandlesVariousValues) {
    int param = GetParam();
    EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
  }

  INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Examples, FooParamTest, ::testing::Values(1,2,3));
  ```

- **Benefits**:
  - Write less repetitive code
  - Cover varied scenarios systematically

### Death Tests
- **Definition**: Special tests that verify your program's behavior on fatal failures (such as asserts that cause process termination).
- **Use case**: Confirming that invalid inputs or illegal states cause the program to exit or crash as expected.
- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  EXPECT_DEATH(MyFunctionThatShouldCrash(), "error message");
  ```

- **Note**: Death tests require careful environment setup and may run test code in subprocesses.

## Typical Workflow with Concepts

1. **Group your tests in Test Suites**, logically organized per class or module.
2. **Use Test Fixtures** to avoid repeating setup/teardown code for tests that share context.
3. **Write clear Assertions** inside your tests to verify behavior.
4. **Generate Mocks** to simulate dependencies and define expectations on behavior.
5. **Employ Matchers** to specify argument conditions precisely for expectations.
6. **Use Parameterized Tests** to verify behavior across multiple inputs efficiently.
7. **Add Death Tests** to ensure correctness under exceptional or fatal conditions.

By mastering these terms and their practical applications, you can write robust, maintainable, and comprehensive tests using GoogleTest.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Test Fixture Consistency**: All tests in a suite must use the same fixture class. Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` for the same suite is illegal and will cause failures.

- **Assertions Selection**: Prefer `EXPECT_` variants when you want tests to continue after failure, and `ASSERT_` if failure should halt test execution immediately.

- **Mock Expectations**: Always specify the number of expected calls (`Times(...)`) to avoid silent failures.

- **Parameterized Test Instantiations**: Forgetting to instantiate your parameterized tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` causes associated tests not to run.

- **Death Test Platform Limitations**: Death tests require supporting features from the platform, including stream redirection and subprocess support.
