# Key Features at a Glance

GoogleTest equips C++ developers with a powerful, flexible, and highly configurable testing framework designed to simplify your testing workflows. This page provides a concise, cheat-sheet style overview of GoogleTest’s core capabilities, enabling you to quickly map the features to your specific development and testing needs.

## Core Testing Model: xUnit-Based Structure

GoogleTest follows the familiar xUnit architecture, organizing tests in suites and fixtures that promote reusability and maintainability:

- **Test Cases/Suites:** Group related tests together.
- **Test Fixtures:** Define common setup and teardown logic, shared among tests.
- **Test Macros:** Use simple, expressive macros like `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P` to define individual and parameterized tests.

This structured approach lets you write clear, organized tests that scale gracefully.

## Automated Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests at runtime without additional registration:

- Simply write tests with the appropriate macros.
- Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your main to execute them.
- Leverage flags like `--gtest_list_tests` to enumerate available tests without running them.

This automation minimizes boilerplate, speeds up feedback loops, and integrates seamlessly into your build and CI pipelines.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

Effortlessly test varying input combinations and types with:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`):** Run the same test logic over multiple input values or sets. Supports generators such as:
  - `Values()`, `ValuesIn()`: Enumerate specific or container-based test parameters.
  - `Range()`: Generate numeric value ranges.
  - `Combine()`: Create Cartesian products of multiple generators.

- **Typed Tests:** Run identical tests over a list of types.

- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Define test templates that can be instantiated with types later, allowing flexible test design.

This feature dramatically reduces code duplication and ensures comprehensive coverage.

### Examples

```cpp
// Simple TEST_P example
class IntTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IntTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(0, GetParam() % 2);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IntTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6));

// Typed Test example
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_ = 0;
};

typedef ::testing::Types<int, bool> MyTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, IsZeroOnInit) {
  EXPECT_EQ(0, this->value_);
}
```

## Advanced Mocking Support with GoogleMock

- GoogleTest seamlessly integrates with **GoogleMock**, enabling sophisticated mocking scenarios.
- Features include:
  - **`MOCK_METHOD` macros:** Declare mock methods with signature matching.
  - **Expectations and Call Specifications:** Define expected method calls and their behaviors using `EXPECT_CALL`.
  - **Behavior Modifiers:** Control call counts (`Times()`), call sequences (`InSequence()`), and actions (`WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`).
- The mocking framework captures complex interactions, facilitating unit testing in isolation.

## Rich Configuration Options

GoogleTest provides comprehensive control over test execution and reporting:

- **Command-Line Flags:** Filter tests, list tests, enable/disable colored output, repeat, shuffle, and control output format.
- **XML and JSON Reports:** Generate detailed machine-readable test reports compatible with CI tools.
- **Custom Test Naming:** Support for customized parameterized test naming conventions.

Example:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.* --gtest_repeat=3 --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

## Benefit-Focused Summary

- **Accelerated Development:** Automated discovery and execution reduce manual test management.
- **Reduced Test Boilerplate:** Parameterized and typed tests condense multiple scenarios into a single test definition.
- **Improved Test Precision:** Advanced mocking enables precise control over dependencies and behaviors.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Customizable and CI-friendly outputs streamline integration.
