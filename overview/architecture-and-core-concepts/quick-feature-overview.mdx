## GoogleTest's Headline Features

| Feature                     | Description & Value                                                | Learn More                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **xUnit-Style Test Macros** | GoogleTest adopts the familiar xUnit style, enabling clear, structured test definitions that integrate well with common C++ workflows and tools. This design reduces the learning curve and encourages best practices in test writing.| [Primer](primer.md)                   |
| **Rich Assertions**          | Provides a versatile set of assertions to verify test outcomes precisely, ranging from simple equality checks to complex predicate-based validations. Assertions enable clear reporting and accurate test failure diagnosis.| [Assertions API](../core-testing-apis/assertions-api) |
| **Automated Test Discovery** | Automatically finds and runs tests based on naming conventions and macros, eliminating manual registration and simplifying test suite maintenance as your codebase grows.| [How GoogleTest Works](how-googletest-works.mdx)    |
| **Test Fixtures**             | Enables grouping of related tests sharing common setup and teardown logic, promoting DRY principles and yielding maintainable, organized test suites.| [Core Concepts & Terminology](core-concepts-terminology.mdx) |
| **Mocks and GoogleMock Integration** | Seamlessly supports mocking via GoogleMock, allowing creation of mock objects with customizable behaviors and expectations, essential for testing modules in isolation and verifying interactions.| [Mocking Guide](gmock_cook_book.md) |
| **Parameterized Tests**       | Supports running the same test logic with multiple input values, drastically improving coverage while reducing redundant code.| [Parameterized Tests](parameterized-tests.mdx)    |
| **Test Execution Control & Reporting** | Offers flexible control over test execution order, filtering tests, and rich reporting for both console output and integration with CI/CD pipelines.| [How GoogleTest Works](how-googletest-works.mdx)    |
