# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide that introduces critical terminology and concepts you will encounter while using GoogleMock. This page is designed to clarify key terms such as **tests**, **assertions**, **mocks**, **expectations**, **actions**, **matchers**, and **strictness levels**, helping you build a strong conceptual framework before diving into detailed usage.

## Understanding the Basics: What You Really Need to Know

GoogleMock provides a powerful toolkit for writing and verifying mock objects in C++. To make the most of it, you should clearly understand the following core concepts:

- **Tests:** The overall units of verification where expectations and mock interactions are verified.
- **Assertions:** Statements in tests that verify conditions and outcomes.
- **Mocks:** Substitute objects that mimic the behavior of real objects for controlled testing.
- **Expectations:** Declarations of how mock methods are supposed to be called (arguments, times, order).
- **Actions:** Define the behavior a mock method should perform when called.
- **Matchers:** Conditions specifying what arguments to expect for mock method calls.
- **Strictness Levels:** Controls that determine how the mock handles unexpected or uninteresting method calls.

Understanding these concepts will help you write precise tests that are clear, maintainable, and robust.

## Key Terminology Explained with Relatable Examples

### Tests
A **test** is a self-contained unit of verification. It can be a single function in your test suite that exercises a part of your code, asserting the expected behavior.

### Assertions
An **assertion** checks if a particular condition holds true during the test. For example, asserting that a function returns the correct value.

### Mocks
A **mock** mimics a real object’s interface but gives you full control and observation over its interactions. GoogleMock helps you create these mock classes effortlessly using macros like `MOCK_METHOD`.

### Expectations
An **expectation** states how you expect your mock's methods to be called—what arguments they should receive, how many times, and in what order. For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, MethodName(arg_matchers))
    .Times(ExactNumber)
    .WillOnce(Return(value));
```

### Actions
An **action** tells the mock what to do when a method is called. This could be returning a value, invoking a callback, or even deleting the mock itself.

### Matchers
**Matchers** are predicates that specify how method arguments are validated. They can range from simple equality to complex custom conditions. The wildcard matcher `_` matches any argument value.

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Ge(10), _));  // First argument >= 10, second anything
```

### Strictness Levels
GoogleMock defines three primary mock strictness levels:

| Strictness   | Behavior on Unexpected Calls                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| NaggyMock    | Prints warnings for uninteresting calls (default behavior).  |
| NiceMock     | Ignores uninteresting calls silently (suppresses warnings).  |
| StrictMock   | Treats uninteresting calls as failures (errors).             |

You can use `NiceMock<T>`, `NaggyMock<T>`, or `StrictMock<T>` to wrap your mock classes accordingly.

## Practical Examples: Mapping Concepts to Code

### Defining a Mock Method

To create a mock method, use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro inside your mock class:

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, DoThis, (), ());  // Mocks void DoThis()
};
```

### Setting an Expectation with a Matcher and Action

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThis())
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return());

mock.DoThis();  // Matches expectation: test passes
```

### Controlling Strictness

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
// Uninteresting calls to nice_mock will not produce warnings.
```

### What Happens on Unexpected Calls?

- If a call does not match any `EXPECT_CALL`, it is an **unexpected call** — always an error.
- If a call is made to a mock method without an `EXPECT_CALL`, it is an **uninteresting call**:
  - `NaggyMock`: Prints a warning.
  - `NiceMock`: Silently ignores.
  - `StrictMock`: Causes a test failure.

## How This Page Fits into the Documentation

This page builds a universal understanding of the foundational terminology used within GoogleMock and testing with GoogleTest.

For deeper technical details, refer to:

- [Mocking Reference](/docs/reference/mocking.md): In-depth explanation of macros, classes, and their usage.
- [gMock Cookbook](/docs/gmock_cook_book.md): Practical recipes for real-world mocking usage.
- [gMock for Dummies](/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md): Beginner-friendly introduction to mocking.

Subsequent pages in the documentation sequence will build on these terms to show how to create, configure, and run mock-based tests efficiently.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Prefer using **NiceMock** by default to reduce warning clutter during refactoring and routine tests.
- Use **StrictMock** for critical tests where unexpected calls must be detected immediately.
- Write **expectations only for interactions you care about**; rely on `ON_CALL` or `NiceMock` default behavior for other methods.
- Define **custom matchers** when argument checking logic is complex or reusable.
- Use **sequences** and **expectation order controls** (`InSequence`, `After`) to validate call order when necessary.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If you see uninteresting call warnings for methods you want to ignore, consider wrapping the mock with `NiceMock` or adding a catch-all expectation.
- If unexpected calls occur, verify your test’s expectations carefully and use verbose mode (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to trace mock call matching.
- When mocking classes not owned by you, prefer creating a thin interface and mock that instead.
- Ensure destructors are virtual in interfaces you mock to avoid runtime issues.
