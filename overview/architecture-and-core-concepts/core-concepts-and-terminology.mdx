# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Building Your GoogleTest Vocabulary

Understanding GoogleTest starts with mastering its essential terms and concepts. This foundational vocabulary will empower you to navigate advanced features confidently and accelerate your onboarding process.

### Why This Matters

As you engage with GoogleTest, you’ll frequently encounter terms like **test cases**, **fixtures**, **assertions**, **matchers**, **death tests**, **mocks**, **expectations**, and **cardinalities**. Grasping these concepts isn’t just about memorizing definitions — it's about seeing how they fit together to create a flexible, expressive testing framework that helps you write reliable, maintainable C++ tests.

## Key Terms Explained

### Test Cases (Test Suites)

A **test case** — now more commonly called a **test suite** — is a collection of related tests grouped together logically. Think of it as a container that organizes tests by feature, class, or module.

- Use test suites to structure your tests coherently.
- Each test within a suite is executed independently to maintain test isolation.

### Fixtures

Fixtures are the shared environment or context in which multiple tests run. Implemented as classes derived from `testing::Test`, fixtures set up common data, objects, or state for each test.

- Fixtures promote code reuse and reduce duplication.
- Each test gets a fresh fixture object, ensuring isolation.
- Use `TEST_F` macros to write tests that depend on fixtures.

*Example*: If you have a database connection or complex object graph needed for many tests, define it once in a fixture’s setup rather than in each test.

### Assertions

Assertions are the checks you make inside tests to verify conditions. GoogleTest provides macros that evaluate expressions and report success or failure:

- **Nonfatal Failures** (`EXPECT_*`): Report a failure but continue executing the current test.
- **Fatal Failures** (`ASSERT_*`): Abort the current test immediately upon failure.

With these, you can verify equalities, inequalities, Boolean conditions, exceptions, floating-point approximations, and more.

*Example*: `EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value)` verifies that `result` equals `expected_value`.

### Matchers

Matchers enable expressive and readable assertions by describing conditions in English-like statements. Used primarily with `EXPECT_THAT()` and `ASSERT_THAT()`, matchers boost test clarity and diagnostic messaging.

They allow:

- Pattern matching (e.g., `StartsWith`, `MatchesRegex`)
- Compositions like `AllOf`, `AnyOf`

You can combine them to build complex assertions while preserving readable failure outputs.

### Death Tests

Death tests validate that certain code paths cause program termination, such as due to failed assertions or critical errors.

- Use macros like `EXPECT_DEATH()` and `ASSERT_DEATH()`.
- Death tests run in isolated subprocesses to safely detect termination without crashing the test runner.
- Useful for verifying your program’s defensive checks.

### Mocks and Expectations

Mocks help simulate components your code interacts with, enabling isolated and controlled testing.

- GoogleMock integrates with GoogleTest for mock object creation.
- **Expectations** define how mock methods should be called, their frequency, and return values.
- Monitor interactions with mocks to ensure correct collaboration between system parts.

### Cardinalities

Cardinalities specify the allowed number of times a mock method can be called.

- Use to enforce that methods are called exactly once, at least once, or never.
- Helps avoid over- or under-use of dependencies.

## How These Concepts Work Together

Imagine you’re developing a feature `Foo`:

1. **Group** all related tests in a test suite named `FooTest`.
2. **Define a fixture** `FooTest` that sets up the necessary context.
3. Within tests defined by `TEST_F(FooTest, TestName)`, harness **assertions** like `EXPECT_EQ` or `EXPECT_THAT` to verify behavior.
4. To validate that a function correctly handles fatal errors, add **death tests**.
5. When your code interacts with external components, replace them with **mocks** and specify **expectations** including permissible **cardinalities**.

Mastering this terminology enables you to leverage GoogleTest’s full power, crafting focused, maintainable, and descriptive tests.

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- Prefer non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) when you want a test to continue checking multiple conditions after one failure.
- Use fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) when further execution would be meaningless or cause crashes.
- Always provide meaningful failure messages by streaming additional context to assertions using `<<`.
- Isolation is key: GoogleTest runs a fresh fixture for each test to avoid side effects leaking between tests.
- For death tests, be mindful that state changes within the death-test subprocess do not affect the parent process.
- Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite or test names to prevent naming conflicts and obscure compiler errors.
