# What is GoogleTest?

## Introducing GoogleTest: Google's Open-Source C++ Unit Testing Framework

Imagine a toolkit designed to empower engineers to write reliable, maintainable C++ code through rigorous automated testing — that is exactly what GoogleTest delivers. As Google's open-source C++ unit testing framework, GoogleTest unifies the strengths of automated testing and mocking under one modern, flexible umbrella.

With GoogleTest, developers can write expressive tests that run fast and provide immediate, clear feedback on code correctness — fostering confidence to evolve software swiftly without breaking functionality.

### Key Benefits of GoogleTest
- **Robust Test Automation:** Built specifically for C++, GoogleTest enables automation of functional correctness checks, reducing manual test effort and avoiding regressions.
- **Expressive Test Writing:** Intuitive macros and test patterns allow for clear, readable, and maintainable test code.
- **Unified Testing and Mocking:** Seamless integration with GoogleMock extends capabilities to mock objects, enabling isolation of complex components.
- **Rapid Feedback:** Tests run efficiently, encouraging frequent verification during development.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Runs consistently across Linux, Windows, macOS, embedded systems, and more.

### Designed For
- C++ developers seeking an effective unit testing and mocking framework.
- Teams prioritizing code quality and maintainability with automated validation.
- Projects ranging from small libraries to large, complex codebases demanding scalable test infrastructure.

## What Is GoogleTest?
GoogleTest is an open-source testing framework created and maintained by Google to facilitate writing and running C++ unit tests.

It serves as a comprehensive solution for engineers wanting to verify their code behavior automatically and consistently. GoogleTest goes beyond basic testing; it supports advanced features like parameterized tests, test fixtures, and integration with mocking.

### Core Purpose
GoogleTest addresses the challenge of ensuring software correctness by enabling:

- Organized test grouping through **test suites**
- Simplified test case writing with expressive macros
- Access to rich assertions that clearly report failures
- Isolation of tests to prevent flaky or interdependent test runs
- Support for both simple and complex test configurations

### What Makes GoogleTest Unique?
- **Integration of Testing and Mocking:** Its sibling library, GoogleMock, is designed to work hand-in-hand with GoogleTest, providing a unified system.

- **Comprehensive Assertion Library:** Offers a broad set of assertion macros, which provide detailed failure diagnostics.

- **Flexible Test Hierarchy:** Supports simple tests, fixtures for shared setup/teardown, typed and parameterized tests for flexible test scenarios.

- **Cross-Platform Entry Points:** For different platforms (including embedded systems), GoogleTest adapts its initialization and execution model transparently.

### How GoogleTest Works at a Glance
GoogleTest organizes tests into suites and runs them through a centralized runner. A typical usage involves:

1. **Including the GoogleTest header:**

   ```cpp
   #include <gtest/gtest.h>
   ```

2. **Writing test cases:** Using the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros to define test functions.

3. **Running tests:** Using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in `main()` to execute all registered tests and report results.

4. **Reporting:** GoogleTest provides detailed feedback both on the console and optionally in XML for integration with CI tools.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Easy Test Definition
- Macros like `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` let you write tests by describing what's being tested.
- Test fixtures using `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)` allow sharing common setup and teardown code.

### 2. Rich Assertions
- Variety of assertions to compare values, check exceptions, and verify conditions.
- `ASSERT_*` macros abort the current test on failure, while `EXPECT_*` macros continue running, allowing multiple checks.

### 3. Parameterized and Typed Tests
- Support for `TEST_P` to run tests with different data parameters.
- Typed tests to run the same test logic across multiple types.

### 4. Test Execution Control
- Initialization with `InitGoogleTest` which processes command-line flags.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to run all defined tests, returning success/failure status.

### 5. Platform Compatibility
- Platform-specific entry points to accommodate embedded and specialized OS environments.

### 6. Global and Per-Suite Setup/TearDown
- `testing::Environment` subclassing to manage global test environment preparation.
- `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` methods to share setup within all tests of a suite.

### Real-World Example
Here's a simple test illustrating GoogleTest in action:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(0));
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(1));
  EXPECT_EQ(2, Factorial(2));
  EXPECT_EQ(6, Factorial(3));
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

When running, it executes all defined tests, reporting concise but detailed results.

## Why You Should Care

Automated testing is the backbone of reliable software development. GoogleTest empowers developers to:

- **Catch bugs early and often:** By facilitating unit test creation and execution.
- **Write maintainable tests:** Clear, expressive macros make tests easy to understand.
- **Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines:** Via command-line integration and XML outputs.
- **Scale tests:** Support for parameterized/typed tests make broad coverage achievable.
- **Develop with confidence:** Fast test feedback encourages rapid iteration.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin using GoogleTest:

1. Include the GoogleTest header in your test files (`#include <gtest/gtest.h>`).
2. Write your first test using the `TEST` macro.
3. Define your `main()` function that calls `testing::InitGoogleTest()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

For most users, linking with the `gtest_main` library provides a pre-built `main()` function.

See the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) for detailed tutorials and [Quickstart](docs/quickstart-cmake.md) for build instructions.
