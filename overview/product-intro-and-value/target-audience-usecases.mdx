# Target Audience & Primary Use Cases

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to empower a broad spectrum of C++ practitioners who are focused on creating robust, maintainable, and efficient software tests. Understanding the key stakeholders and typical scenarios where these tools shine helps you maximize their value in your development workflow.

## Who Should Use GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

### 1. C++ Developers

* **Individual Contributors and Small Teams:**
  - Those writing unit tests to verify individual components.
  - Developers who want to catch regressions early with fast feedback.
  - Engineers adopting test-driven development (TDD) for better design.

* **Large Teams and Codebases:**
  - Developers collaborating on complex projects where clear contracts and reliable regression tests are essential.
  - Teams needing to mock dependencies to isolate units for testing.

### 2. Software Architects and Design Engineers

* Professionals responsible for overall system design who emphasize modular, testable code.
* They use mocks to define clear interface boundaries and validate interactions between components.

### 3. CI/CD Engineers and Automation Specialists

* Those configuring build pipelines to run unit and integration tests automatically.
* Users interested in generating detailed, actionable reports on failures to accelerate debugging.

### 4. Open Source and Enterprise Teams

* Projects of any scale, from open source libraries to enterprise-grade systems, benefit from the scalability and flexibility of GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

## Typical Use Cases

### Unit Testing

GoogleTest is the go-to framework for writing, running, and managing C++ unit tests.

- Validate individual classes and functions by defining clear input-output expectations.
- Utilize mock classes generated by GoogleMock to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies.
- Set precise expectations on mock methods, including call order, invocation counts, and argument validation.

### Integration Testing

While primarily intended for unit tests, GoogleTest and GoogleMock are also effective at integration testing.

- Use mocks to simulate subsystems or external services to test integration points.
- Define sequences and partial ordering constraints to validate complex interactions.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Prototyping

- Engineers can rapidly iterate on interface designs using mocks before implementation is available.
- Verify interactions explicitly, detecting design issues early.

### Handling Legacy or Difficult-to-Test Code

- GoogleMock can be used to isolate code units even when refactoring legacy code.
- Mocking side effects and complex interactions to write regression tests without wholesale rewrites.

### Controlling Test Strictness

- Use **NaggyMock** (default) to warn about uninteresting calls, aiding incremental test enhancements.
- Use **NiceMock** to suppress warnings when uninteresting calls are expected or irrelevant.
- Use **StrictMock** to enforce strict verification that no unexpected calls occur, suitable for final regressions tests.

## Real-World Workflow Example

Imagine you are developing a graphics application with a `Turtle` interface:

1. **Write a Mock Class:**

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

2. **Set Expectations in Tests:**

```cpp
MockTurtle turtle;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
    .Times(::testing::AtLeast(1));
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Turn(::testing::_));
```

3. **Exercise Code Under Test:**

```cpp
Painter painter(&turtle);
EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
```

4. **Verification:**

GoogleMock automatically verifies that all expectations were met when `turtle` is destructed.

## Why This Matters to You

* **Improved Code Quality:** Rigorous testing catches defects early.
* **Better Designs:** Encourages modular and testable architecture.
* **Faster Development:** Immediate feedback on code changes speeds development cycles.
* **Reduced Maintenance Costs:** Well-tested software reduces the cost of future modifications.
