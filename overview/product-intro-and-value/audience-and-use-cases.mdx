## Who Should Use GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is engineered to serve a broad spectrum of C++ developers and teams seeking reliable, maintainable, and scalable testing solutions.

- **C++ Developers:** Whether working on small modules or large-scale applications, developers gain confidence by quickly writing and running automated tests that catch regressions early.

- **Test Engineers:** Quality assurance teams benefit from employing GoogleTest to build systematic test suites, tailor complex test cases with fixtures, and automate verification processes.

- **Open-Source Maintainers:** Public codebases leverage GoogleTest for continuous validation across diverse environments, improving software quality and community trust.

- **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline Integrators:** Engineers involved in CI environments use GoogleTest to seamlessly integrate reliable test automation into build and deployment cycles.

- **Safety-Critical Systems Developers:** Projects requiring stringent validation, such as in aerospace or healthcare, use GoogleTest’s expressive assertions to enforce correctness and compliance.

- **Cross-Platform Application Teams:** Teams developing across multiple OS and hardware platforms rely on GoogleTest’s portability and compatibility.

## Typical Adoption Scenarios

### 1. Automated Test Suites in CI/CD Pipelines

Integrate GoogleTest with build systems to:

- Automatically run tests on every commit, merge, or nightly build.
- Generate detailed reports for quick feedback on failures.
- Ensure code changes do not break existing features.

### 2. Unit and Integration Testing for Safety-Critical Code

GoogleTest supports:

- Writing precise, readable tests for mission-critical modules.
- Setting strict expectations and validations to detect faults early.
- Supporting hierarchical and parameterized tests.

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing in Open-Source Projects

Due to its portability,

- Open-source projects use GoogleTest to verify code consistency on various OS (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Contributors can run the same test suites locally and in automated environments.

### 4. Maintaining Large-Scale Codebases

GoogleTest scales to millions of lines of code,

- Assisting in regression prevention through incremental testing.
- Facilitating refactoring with confidence by quickly pinpointing issues.

### 5. Experimenting with Interface Designs

Developers use GoogleTest to create mocks (via GoogleMock) for:

- Designing modules through interaction-based testing.
- Decoupling functionality and testing components in isolation.

## Why This Matters

Without robust testing frameworks, teams often face fragile tests, slow feedback loops, and increased risks of regressions. GoogleTest empowers users to:

- Develop code with confidence and faster iteration.
- Automate repetitive verification tasks, freeing human resources.
- Adapt testing strategies to diverse project requirements and team sizes.
