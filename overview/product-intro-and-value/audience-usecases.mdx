# Who Should Use GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is built to empower C++ developers, library maintainers, QA engineers, and open-source contributors who seek a robust, intuitive, and highly maintainable testing infrastructure. Whether you are crafting small unit tests, orchestrating complex integration setups, or refactoring legacy systems, GoogleTest provides the tools and flexibility to help you write reliable, fast, and expressive tests.

## Target Audience

- **C++ Developers:** Professionals and enthusiasts writing C++ code who need a comprehensive framework to create, run, and validate their tests with detailed diagnostics and support for modern C++ features.

- **Library Maintainers:** Authors and maintainers of reusable C++ libraries who require a clean, consistent, and scalable testing approach to ensure their APIs behave as intended across different environments.

- **QA Engineers:** Specialists who need to automate rigorous testing across multiple scenarios, often integrating GoogleTest into broader continuous integration pipelines and test frameworks.

- **Open Source Contributors:** Community members who want to confidently contribute improvements and fixes to open-source projects already using GoogleTest, benefiting from its standardized patterns and rich features.


## Common Use Cases

GoogleTest is designed to handle a broad spectrum of testing needs encountered in real-world C++ projects, illustrated by its use in well-known projects such as Chromium and LLVM.

- **Unit Testing:** Write small, fast, and isolated tests to verify the correctness of individual classes and functions, capturing edge cases and ensuring regressions are caught early.

- **Integration Testing:** Compose tests that validate interactions between components, verifying that subsystems cooperate correctly under various conditions.

- **Legacy Code Refactoring:** Safely update and improve legacy codebases by writing tests that prevent behavior regressions, enabling confident incremental changes.

- **Mocking and Test Doubles:** Using GoogleMock alongside GoogleTest, simulate complex dependencies and interactions without relying on actual implementations, facilitating testing of hard-to-reach code paths and error handling.


## Why It Matters to You

Adopting GoogleTest means embracing a modern, proven C++ testing framework that continually evolves with community input and expert stewardship. It reduces the friction in writing and maintaining tests by providing:

- **Clear and expressive syntax:** Makes tests easy to read and write, reducing onboarding time and maintenance costs.

- **Comprehensive assertion and mocking capabilities:** Saves you from writing boilerplate verification code manually.

- **Robustness across environments:** Enables you to write portable tests suitable for a variety of platforms and CI systems.

- **Integration-ready design:** Fits well with existing build systems and test runners, allowing smooth adoption in your projects.

## Getting Started

To begin leveraging GoogleTest for your projects:

- Review the [What is GoogleTest?](what-is-googletest) page to understand the core concepts.
- Explore the [Why Use GoogleTest?](value-proposition) page for insight into its advantages.
- Dive into [Writing Your First Tests and Mocks](setup_project) to start writing tests immediately.


<Tip>
If you're new, focus first on mastering the simple `TEST` and `EXPECT_` macros before moving on to mocks (`MOCK_METHOD`, `EXPECT_CALL`) and advanced features.
