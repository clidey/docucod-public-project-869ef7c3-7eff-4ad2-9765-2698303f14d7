# Core Concepts & Terminology

Familiarize yourself with foundational terms such as assertions, test fixtures, test cases, matchers, mocks, actions, and parameterization. Each concept is defined with practical context, helping you write effective tests, interpret test results, and understand documentation and error output.

---

## Introduction

Understanding the core concepts and terminology of GoogleTest and GoogleMock is crucial to writing clear, maintainable, and powerful tests. This page explains key testing elements and mocking principles to help you navigate your testing journey with confidence and clarity.

---

## Assertions

An *assertion* verifies that a condition holds true during a test. Assertions are the foundation of GoogleTest’s unit testing, enabling you to check values, pointers, exceptions, and more.

### Key Points:
- Assertions are statements in your tests that confirm expected behavior.
- They can be **fatal** (`ASSERT_*`, which aborts the current test on failure) or **non-fatal** (`EXPECT_*`, which reports a failure but allows the test to continue).
- Examples:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(expected_value, actual_value); // Check equality
ASSERT_TRUE(condition);                  // Check boolean condition
```

Assertions provide clear diagnostics on failure, allowing you to quickly pinpoint issues with informative error messages.

---

## Test Fixtures and Test Cases

Test fixtures provide a way to set up common test environments for multiple test cases, reducing duplication and making tests easier to read and maintain.

- A *test case* groups related tests, often representing the functionality of a class or module.
- A *test fixture* is a class that holds common setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) code for tests.

### Example:

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common initialization
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
  }
  // Shared objects can be defined here
  MyClass obj_;
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestOne) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(obj_.DoSomething());
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestTwo) {
  EXPECT_EQ(42, obj_.Calculate());
}
```

Use test fixtures whenever multiple tests share common prerequisites.

---

## Matchers

Matchers specify the conditions under which arguments of mocked methods must match to satisfy expectations.

- Matchers act like predicates against arguments passed in mock method calls.
- The simplest matcher is `_`, which matches anything.
- Common matchers include `Eq(value)`, `Ge(value)`, `Lt(value)`, `NotNull()`, and custom matchers.

### Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Foo(Eq(42), _));
```

This expects `Foo` to be called with the first argument equal to 42 and the second argument can be anything.

Matchers can be combined, nested, and customized for detailed behavior verification.

---

## Mocks

A *mock* object simulates the behavior of real objects by implementing the same interface but allowing you to specify and verify interactions.

- Mocks are used to isolate units of code and remove external dependencies during testing.
- GoogleMock automates mock creation through the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

### Defining a Mock:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public FooInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (int value), (override));
};
```

### Using a Mock:

1. Create a mock object
2. Set expectations on methods with `EXPECT_CALL`
3. Exercise your code that interacts with the mock
4. GoogleMock automatically verifies expectations are met

### `EXPECT_CALL` Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(42))
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return());
```

If the call to `Bar` with argument 42 does not happen once, the test will fail.

Note the importance of setting expectations *before* exercising code that calls mocks.

---

## Actions

Actions specify what a mocked method actually does when called, such as returning values, invoking callbacks, or modifying arguments.

- By default, for non-void methods, GoogleMock returns default-constructed values unless an action is specified.
- Use `.WillOnce()` for specifying one-time behaviors or `.WillRepeatedly()` for behaviors that apply to all calls.

### Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(10))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(20));
```

This means the first call to `GetValue()` returns 10, subsequent calls return 20.

You can define complex actions including invoking user functions or deleting arguments.

---

## Parameterization

GoogleTest supports *parameterized tests* allowing you to run the same test logic with multiple inputs.

- Makes testing multiple data variations efficient and organized.
- You write a single test definition and provide distinct input combinations.

For mocking, parameterization extends to matchers, expectations, and actions to control behavior dynamically based on arguments.

## Glossary of Key Terms

| Term           | Definition                                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assertion      | A test statement verifying some condition is true.                                        |
| Test Fixture   | A class that holds shared setup and teardown logic for tests.                             |
| Test Case      | A group of related tests (historically, now replaced by Test Suite in GoogleTest).        |
| Matcher        | Predicate that defines expected argument conditions for mock methods.                     |
| Mock Object    | A simulated object used for verifying interactions in isolation of dependencies.          |
| Expectation    | An expected interaction set on a mock method (defined via `EXPECT_CALL`).                  |
| Action         | Behavior a mock method executes when invoked (specified via `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`). |
| Parameterized Test | A test template that runs multiple times with different inputs.                          |

## Practical Tips

- Always mock only virtual methods. Attempting to mock non-virtual ones is unsupported.
- Use `_` matcher when argument values are irrelevant to your test.
- Set expectations before exercising the code under test to avoid undefined behavior.
- Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects to control call order when necessary.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations to keep tests maintainable.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls when appropriate.
- Use `StrictMock` if you want uninteresting calls to cause failures.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls in Core Concepts & Terminology">
<Accordion title="Mock Method Not Called Error">
If GoogleMock reports an expected method was not called:
- Confirm the call is made in your test flow.
- Ensure expectations are set before calling the code.
- Check argument matchers to verify they align with actual values.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Call Failures">
Occurs when a mock method is called with arguments not matching any expectation:
- Add broader matchers or a catch-all expectation (e.g., `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_))`) if some calls are allowed but not verified.
- Review call order constraints.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting Call Warnings">
GoogleMock warns when a mock method without any expectations is called:
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings.
- Add explicit `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` to acknowledge calls.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
