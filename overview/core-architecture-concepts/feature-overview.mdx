# Feature Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a comprehensive and powerful C++ testing and mocking framework. This page summarizes the key features that enable developers to write clear, maintainable, and effective tests, offering an insightful glance at the framework’s extensive capabilities. Whether you are new to the framework or looking to deepen your understanding, this overview highlights the essential tools and options available.

---

## Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs tests based on how you define them using simple macros. You simply write test cases using the test fixture and test macros, and the framework finds and executes them without additional setup.

- **Automatic Test Discovery:** No manual registration is required. Tests are detected through macro definitions.
- **Flexible Test Runner:** Command-line options allow you to filter tests by name, control test order, repeat specific tests, and configure output formats.
- **Death Tests:** Specialized tests to ensure your code crashes safely under certain conditions, essential for robustness validation.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

// This test will be automatically discovered and run.
```

---

## Custom Assertions

Assertions in GoogleTest let you check conditions and notify immediately when something unexpected occurs. GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertion macros, and GoogleMock extends this with expressive matchers.

- **Rich Set of Assertions:** Include equality, inequality, floating point comparisons, exceptions, and more.
- **Custom Assertions Support:** Easily extendable to define your own assertion logic if the built-in ones don’t fit.
- **Actionable Error Messages:** Assertions provide detailed messages and stack traces to simplify debugging.

---

## Death Tests

Death tests allow you to write tests that verify your program terminates under expected failure conditions (such as assertions or fatal errors). This is vital for confirming your program behaves correctly in unsafe scenarios.

- **Safe Execution Environment:** Runs test code in a subprocess to isolate crashes.
- **Declarative Syntax:** Define death tests with familiar macros.
- **Output Checking:** You can verify that the death test triggers the expected error messages.

---

## Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests drastically reduce code duplication by allowing you to write a single test case that runs multiple times with different parameters.

- **Value and Type Parameterization:** Parameterize tests with values (e.g., integers) or types (e.g., different classes).
- **Combining Fixtures and Parameters:** Write fixture-based tests that automatically receive parameters.
- **Scalable Testing:** Cover various scenarios without rewriting tests.

### Example

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers,
                         MyParamTest,
                         testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

---

## Test Runner Options

The test runner supports numerous command-line options enabling control over test execution:

- **Test Filtering:** Run specific tests by name patterns.
- **Output Format:** Generate XML or JSON reports for CI systems.
- **Repetition and Shuffling:** Repeat tests or randomize test order for robustness.
- **Timeouts and Death Test Controls:** Settings for sensitive tests.

---

## GoogleMock Features

Built on top of GoogleTest, GoogleMock brings advanced mocking capabilities:

- **Mock Objects:** Easily create mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- **Setting Expectations:** Define expected calls with arguments, call counts, and order.
- **Rich Matchers:** Match arguments flexibly, including custom predicates.
- **Actions:** Specify what mocks should do upon call (return values, invoke callbacks, modify arguments).
- **Sequence and Ordering:** Control the order of calls across multiple mocks.

### Example

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp()).Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100)).Times(1);

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  painter.DrawLine(100);
}
```

## Why Use This Feature Overview?

This page is your gateway to understanding the breadth of GoogleTest and GoogleMock features. It helps you:

- Quickly identify the powerful tools at your disposal.
- Understand how tests are structured and executed.
- Begin planning how to write expressive, reliable, and maintainable tests.
- Learn about flexible mocking strategies to decouple tests from external dependencies.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Define Your Tests Clearly:** Use parameterized tests to cover a range of inputs without repetitive code.
- **Use Matchers Wisely:** Avoid over-specifying mock expectations to keep tests maintainable.
- **Control Call Order When Necessary:** Use sequences and `InSequence` to enforce call order only when it matters.
- **Leverage Death Tests Carefully:** Ensure stability without creating flaky tests.
- **Explore Test Runner Options:** Tailor test execution and reporting to your team's needs.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- Missing virtual destructors in interfaces can cause test failures or leaks.
- Overly strict mock expectations lead to brittle tests that break on harmless changes.
- Expectation set after call leads to undefined behavior — always set before use.
- For uninteresting calls warnings, use `NiceMock` if you want to suppress noise.
