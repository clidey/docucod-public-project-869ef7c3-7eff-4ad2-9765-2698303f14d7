# Extending and Contributing

Explore opportunities to extend GoogleTest and contribute to the ecosystem, including pointers to related open-source projects, available listeners, adapters, and third-party add-ons.

## Empowering the GoogleTest Ecosystem

GoogleTest is designed to not only be a robust, scalable testing framework but also an extensible platform that encourages contributions and integrations. Whether you're looking to enhance GoogleTest’s core capabilities, create tooling integrations, or develop custom listeners and adapters, this page guides you through how you can extend and contribute to the project.

## Why Extend GoogleTest?

GoogleTest’s architecture fosters a vibrant ecosystem of tools and extensions that help meet diverse testing needs:

- **Customize Test Event Handling:** Add or replace event listeners to capture, log, or manipulate test results.
- **Develop Third-Party Adapters:** Integrate GoogleTest seamlessly with IDEs, continuous integration services, or test runners.
- **Create New Assertion Macros or Matchers:** Enhance expressive power for domain-specific testing requirements.
- **Contribute Bugfixes and Performance Improvements:** Help maintain GoogleTest’s reliability and efficiency.

## Available Extension Points

### 1. Event Listeners

GoogleTest provides an event listener API that lets you hook into key points of test execution, such as test start, test end, and assertion results. You can use or implement custom listeners:

- **Default Listeners:** Modify or replace the default console output and XML/JSON reporters.
- **User-Defined Listeners:** Implement listeners by subclassing `testing::TestEventListener` or `testing::EmptyTestEventListener` for selective notifications.

Example usage:

```cpp
class MinimalistListener : public testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    printf("Test %s.%s started.\n", test_info.test_suite_name(), test_info.name());
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners().Append(new MinimalistListener);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### 2. Custom Matchers

Extend GoogleTest’s assertion framework with custom matchers to improve clarity and reusability in test expressions. For guidance, refer to [Writing Custom Matchers](/api-reference/matchers-and-utilities/custom-matchers).

### 3. Test Macros and Assertion Enhancements

You can define domain-specific assertion macros based on GoogleTest’s rich API of assertions (e.g., `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_DEATH`), or create new types of tests by leveraging value-parameterized or typed test features.

### 4. Integration with Tooling and Extensions

Numerous third-party projects augment GoogleTest with GUIs, test runners, and IDE support:

- **GTest Runner:** Qt5-based automated test runner with a GUI for Windows and Linux.
- **GoogleTest UI:** Visual Studio Code and other IDE extensions for displaying test progress and results.
- **gtest-parallel:** Tool for parallel test execution to speed up large test suites.
- **GTest TAP Listener:** Provides TAP protocol support for integration with TAP-based tools.

You are encouraged to contribute to existing projects or develop your own adapters.

## Contribution Guidelines

GoogleTest welcomes contributions that enhance the framework, improve documentation, and fix bugs. Follow these recommended practices:

- Familiarize yourself with GoogleTest’s [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Write clear, testable, and maintainable code that aligns with existing architecture.
- Include test cases for new features or bug fixes.
- Provide meaningful commit messages and documentation for your changes.

## Best Practices for Extending

- Leverage GoogleTest’s event listener API rather than modifying core code.
- Use existing extension points to maintain compatibility and ease of upgrade.
- Write comprehensive tests to validate new behaviors.
- Follow the GoogleTest coding style and documentation standards.

## Next Steps

- To start contributing, clone the [GoogleTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest) and set up your development environment.
- Explore the [GoogleTest Primer](/overview/about-googletest/introduction) for foundational understanding.
- Review the [GoogleTest API Reference](/api-reference/gtest-core-api/test-macros-and-assertions) to get familiar with existing extensibility patterns.
- Consider experimenting with event listeners or writing a simple custom matcher.
- Join the community discussion channels and mailing lists linked in the project repository for support and collaboration opportunities.
