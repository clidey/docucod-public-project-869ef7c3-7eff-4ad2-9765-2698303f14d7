# Supported Platforms and Dependencies

GoogleTest ensures broad compatibility while maintaining high standards of performance and reliability across diverse environments. This page guides you through the officially supported platforms, compilers, build environments, and key dependencies, enabling you to quickly assess if GoogleTest fits your project’s technical requirements before integration.

---

## Overview: Compatibility at a Glance

Before adopting GoogleTest, understanding platform and dependency support helps avoid integration hurdles and ensures smooth CI/CD workflows.

### What This Page Covers
- Platforms and operating systems officially supported.
- Compiler versions and C++ standard requirements.
- Key dependencies such as Abseil and RE2.
- Environment-specific features and threading support.

### Why It Matters
Knowing what’s supported streamlines setup and helps anticipate potential limitations or required configuration tweaks. This is critical for teams managing cross-platform projects or embedding GoogleTest in complex builds.

## Platforms and Operating Systems Supported

GoogleTest is developed and tested following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), which defines a curated set of platforms and compilers to ensure stability and performance.

| Platform        | Notes / Details                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Linux           | Stable support including Android NDK    |
| macOS           | Full support, including iOS variant     |
| Windows         | Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile supported with necessary caveats |
| FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD | Supported but may have less testing coverage |
| AIX, Solaris, HP-UX | Supported, though less frequently tested |
| Embedded Systems (ESP8266/ESP32, Xtensa, QURT, etc.) | Limited support, with feature restrictions |


<Info>
GoogleTest defines platform macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC` internally to detect and adapt behavior accordingly. These macros help you write conditional test code if needed.

## Compiler and Language Requirements

GoogleTest requires a modern C++17 compatible compiler as a baseline for building and usage.

### Minimum C++ Standard
- **C++17** (_`__cplusplus` >= 201703L_): This requirement reflects the minimal language features and standard library usage GoogleTest relies on.

### Supported Compilers

| Compiler        | Minimum Version / Notes                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| GCC             | 7.0 and later (with some exceptions for specific features) |
| Clang           | 3.8 and later; fully supported with LLVM-based toolchains |
| MSVC            | Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 or later (MSVC 19.11 or higher) |
| Intel C++ Compiler | 19.x or newer                           |
| SunPro, IBM, HP compilers | Supported with caveats, check environment |

### Compiler Flags and Build System Notes
- GoogleTest detects and configures threading, exception support, and other features automatically where possible.
- Custom macros can override detection when necessary (e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` to disable pthread support).

<Tip>
To explicitly set the required C++ standard in your build, use flags such as `-std=c++17` or your build system’s equivalent (e.g., `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` in CMake).
</Tip>

---

## Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest supports multi-threaded test execution if the underlying platform and compiler toolchain provide threading primitives.

- **POSIX Threads** are supported on most Unix-like platforms including Linux and macOS.
- **Windows Threading API** support exists for Windows desktop and MinGW environments.
- A compile-time macro `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` lets you detect if GoogleTest was built with threading support.

<Warning>
If your environment lacks threading primitives or you disable threading via macros, GoogleTest will still compile but tests will not run concurrently and some features (such as death tests) might be unavailable.
</Warning>

---

## Regular Expression and Dependency Integration

GoogleTest uses regular expressions internally for pattern matching in test names and filters. The implementation adapts based on available dependencies:

- **Abseil & RE2**: When compiled with Abseil support, GoogleTest integrates RE2 for its regex engine, offering efficient and flexible regular expression support. This is indicated by the `GTEST_HAS_ABSL` flag internally.
- **POSIX Regex**: On POSIX platforms without RE2, the native POSIX regular expression implementation is used.
- **Simple Regex**: On other platforms, a simplified regex engine is used as a fallback.

This adaptive approach offers reliable regex support across environments without forcing heavy dependencies.

---

## Filesystem and Stream Redirection Support

Many GoogleTest features rely on filesystem access and stream redirection capabilities:

- `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` flag indicates if filesystem operations are available.
- Stream redirection for standard output and error is controlled by `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`.

Platforms such as Windows Mobile, embedded systems like ESP8266, and others with limited OS capabilities may lack these features. Certain testing functionalities—like death tests—depend on a functioning filesystem and stream redirection.

---

## Build and Integration Dependencies

### Build System
- GoogleTest provides a mature [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build script supporting cross-platform compilation and smooth integration.
- The build sets important compiler flags suitable for your environment, including exceptions and RTTI handling.

### Integration with GoogleMock
- GoogleMock, the mocking framework integrated with GoogleTest, shares the platform and compiler support.
- When building GoogleMock, ensure correct linking and flag propagation for consistency.

### Shared Libraries
- Support for building GoogleTest and GoogleMock as shared libraries (DLLs on Windows) is officially supported.
- Use compiler flags `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when building GoogleTest itself as a shared library.
- When linking to shared GoogleTest libraries, the flag `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` should be used for your test binaries.

## Summary: Ensuring Compatibility

| Aspect                | Summary                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Platforms             | Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD variants, select embedded targets |
| Compiler              | C++17 capable GCC, Clang, MSVC 2017+, etc. |
| Threading             | POSIX or Windows threading supported for concurrency |
| Regex                 | Uses RE2 with Abseil, POSIX regex, or built-in fallback |
| Filesystem & IO       | Required for death tests and output capturing |
| Build System          | CMake integration with helpful compiler flag management |

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Verify Features**: Use `#ifdef` guards on macros like `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` to conditionally enable concurrent test logic.
- **Check Platform Flags**: For platform-specific behavior, use `GTEST_OS_*` macros to maintain portability.
- **C++ Standard Compliance**: Always ensure your build environment enforces at least C++17.
- **Leverage CMake Options**: Utilize provided CMake options such as `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` and `gtest_force_shared_crt` to align library linkage with your project.
- **Monitor Dependencies**: When compiling with Abseil, be sure to resolve RE2 as it is a mandatory dependency.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform and Compiler Issues">
<Accordion title="Compiler Version Too Low">
If your compiler does not support C++17 or is below the minimum version (e.g., MSVC below 2017 Update 3), compilation will fail with errors referencing language features or missing standard library components. Upgrade your toolchain or adjust the build environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading Macros Not Set as Expected">
If `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` is 0, GoogleTest will not support multi-threaded tests. Ensure your platform supports pthreads or Windows threading, or explicitly enable pthread support through compilation flags.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Dependencies with Abseil Integration">
If GoogleTest detects Abseil support, RE2 is required. Build failures related to RE2 may indicate that RE2 is missing or improperly linked. Confirm Abseil and RE2 availability in your build environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Filesystem or Stream Redirection Not Supported">
On limited or embedded platforms, filesystem or stream redirection support may be absent. Some features like death tests might be disabled automatically. Consider your environment's capabilities when designing tests.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
