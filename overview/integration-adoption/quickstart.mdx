# Quickstart & Where to Learn More

Welcome to the fastest way to get started with GoogleTest, Google's C++ testing framework. This page serves as your launchpad, guiding you through immediate quickstart options for setting up GoogleTest with your preferred build system, and pointing you towards valuable resources to deepen your understanding and accelerate your testing capabilities.

## Quickstart Guides

To help you hit the ground running, GoogleTest offers two primary quickstart paths based on your build system:

### 1. Building with CMake

If your project uses CMake, the [Quickstart: Building with CMake](quickstart-cmake.md) guide is your ideal starting point. It walks you through:

- Setting up a CMake project that depends on GoogleTest using `FetchContent`.
- Writing a simple test file that demonstrates basic assertions.
- Configuring your `CMakeLists.txt` to build and link tests with GoogleTest.
- Running your tests efficiently with CMake's test discovery system.

This guide assumes you have CMake installed and a compatible compiler (C++17 or higher).

### 2. Building with Bazel

For teams using Bazel, GoogleTest provides the [Quickstart: Building with Bazel](quickstart-bazel.md) tutorial, which covers:

- Setting up a Bazel workspace with an appropriate `MODULE.bazel` file to consume GoogleTest from the Bazel Central Registry.
- Creating a Bazel `BUILD` file to compile and link your test binaries.
- Writing a simple test source file with GoogleTest assertions.
- Building and running tests with Bazel commands.

This guide requires Bazel 7.0 or higher and a suitable C++ compiler.

## Why These Guides Matter

GoogleTest is designed to maximize your productivity and improve code quality. Getting up and running quickly means you can start writing meaningful tests and integrating them into your development workflow sooner. These quickstart guides are concise yet comprehensive, covering the basics you need without overwhelming detail.

By following the quickstart suited to your build system, you will:

- Understand how to declare dependencies on GoogleTest.
- Set up build configurations that handle compilation, linking, and test discovery.
- Write your first test(s) with practical assertion examples.
- Execute your test suite and interpret results.

## Additional Resources for Deeper Learning

Beyond getting your tests running, GoogleTest offers extensive documentation to help you master testing techniques and framework features:

- **GoogleTest Primer**: Learn how to write simple, effective tests and understand core concepts.

- **GoogleMock (gMock)**: Explore the mocking framework that complements GoogleTest for advanced testing scenarios.

- **Supported Platforms**: Confirm your environment compatibility, ensuring a smooth setup.

- **Feature Overview**: Discover GoogleTest's major capabilities, from parameterized tests to death tests.

- **Best Practices and Patterns**: Get recommendations for writing maintainable and reliable tests.

- **Samples and Examples**: Browse ready-to-use code samples to build confidence and speed up development.

## Navigation & Next Steps

After completing your chosen quickstart guide, here’s a recommended path to progress:

### Step 1: Write Your First Tests

Head to the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) to understand test definitions, assertions, and test fixtures. This foundation will empower you to craft effective test suites that reflect your application's logic.

### Step 2: Explore Mocking

If your code interacts with external dependencies, learn how to isolate them through mocks with the [GoogleMock introduction](gmock_for_dummies.md) and the [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md).

### Step 3: Understand Platform Support

Review the [Supported Platforms and Dependencies](platforms.md) page to check environment requirements, compiler versions, and platform-specific notes.

### Step 4: Dive Into Advanced Features & Best Practices

Enhance your testing skills with guides on assertions, parameterized tests, advanced mocking, and integration with continuous integration workflows.

## Summary

This page streamlines your journey to running GoogleTest by offering direct access to quickstart tutorials for CMake and Bazel users. It also points towards essential learning materials and official documentation to deepen your mastery of C++ testing with GoogleTest.

Whether you’re setting up from scratch or integrating into an existing project, these resources provide clear, actionable steps to boost your testing efficiency and code quality.

<Tip>
If you’re unsure which build system to choose, consider your current project setup or team standards—pick CMake if you manage builds with CMakeLists, or Bazel if your project relies on Bazel workspaces and BUILD files.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

If you encounter problems during setup:

- Check compiler versions meet GoogleTest’s C++17 requirement.
- Confirm dependencies like CMake (for CMake build) or Bazel are installed correctly.
- Review your build configuration files for syntax errors or missing dependencies.
- See the [Troubleshooting Setup & Installation](troubleshooting-setup.md) page for detailed guidance.
