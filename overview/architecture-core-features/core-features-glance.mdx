# Key Features at a Glance

GoogleTest equips developers with a robust feature set that simplifies and strengthens C++ testing. This page presents a concise, actionable overview of the core features of GoogleTest, emphasizing what you can achieve with each and how they fit into your testing toolkit.

## Assertions

Assertions are the backbone of validation in GoogleTest. They let you verify conditions about your code's state and behavior during test execution. GoogleTest provides a rich variety of assertions that support different data types and test outcomes.

- **Basic Assertions:** Verify boolean conditions (e.g., `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`).
- **Equality & Comparison Assertions:** Compare values (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_LT`).
- **String Assertions:** Compare C strings with appropriate handling (e.g., `EXPECT_STREQ`).
- **Floating-Point Assertions:** Handle approximate equality, considering rounding errors (e.g., `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`).
- **Predicate Assertions:** Support complex custom verification using predicates (e.g., `EXPECT_PRED2`).

> **User Value:** Gain precise control over test success criteria and catch failed expectations early with detailed failure messages.

Explore the full range of assertion macros in the [Assertions Reference](/docs/reference/assertions.md).


## Mocking (gMock)

GoogleTest integrates GoogleMock (gMock), a powerful mocking framework that enables the creation of mock classes and objects to isolate dependencies and verify interactions.

- **Declarative Mocking:** Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to declare mocked methods quickly.
- **Expectations & Behavior:** Set expectations on calls using `EXPECT_CALL` and define behaviors with `WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`, etc.
- **Uninteresting Calls Handling:** Control warnings or failures on unexpected/mock calls using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` wrappers.
- **Match Arguments Easily:** Use rich matchers like `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `AllOf()`, and custom predicates to specify argument matching logic.
- **Support for Move-Only Types:** Mock methods can return and accept move-only types (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`).
- **Ordering & Sequences:** Enforce call order with `InSequence` and `After` clauses.

> **User Value:** Decouple unit tests from complex dependencies, gain control over expected interactions, and simulate various scenarios with ease.

Understand mock class creation and usage in the [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) guide and details in the [Mocking Reference](/docs/reference/mocking.md).


## Parameterized and Typed Tests

Reuse test logic efficiently by running the same tests with different inputs or types:

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run a single test logic multiple times over different input data sets.
- **Typed Tests:** Write a test once and run it against multiple types.

> **User Value:** Minimize duplicated code, improve test coverage, and test across various input combinations or types consistently.

See how to implement these in the [Working with Parameterized and Typed Tests](/guides/advanced-testing-features/parameterized-tests) guide.


## Death Tests

For verifying that code terminates under certain conditions, GoogleTest provides death tests.

- **Process Termination Testing:** Verify that your code crashes or exits with an expected error in a controlled manner.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Death tests work on Linux, Windows, and Mac, handling process spawning appropriately.

> **User Value:** Confidently test failure scenarios that cause process termination without affecting the stability of your test suite.

Learn more in the [Testing for Failures with Death Tests](/guides/advanced-testing-features/death-tests) guide.


## Test Runners and Integration

Run and integrate tests smoothly with your development workflow:

- **Test Execution:** Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to automatically run all defined tests.
- **Integrate with Build Systems:** GoogleTest works with popular build tools like Bazel and CMake.
- **Continuous Integration Friendly:** Supports integration with CI tools and test runners.

> **User Value:** Accelerate development cycles with automated testing and seamless tooling integration.

## Practical Tip

When working with mocks:

- First define your mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to set precise call expectations before exercising the system under test.
- If you want to suppress warnings from uninteresting calls, consider wrapping your mocks with `NiceMock`.
- For rigorous tests, use `StrictMock` to detect unexpected interactions.

Don't forget to consult the samples directory for examples illustrating these features in action: [Googletest Samples](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest/samples).
