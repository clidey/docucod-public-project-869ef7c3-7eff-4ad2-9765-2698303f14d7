# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to the foundational page that lays out the essential vocabulary and key concepts for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. Whether you're new to the framework or refining your testing skills, mastering these terms ensures clear communication and smoother test development.

---

## Why This Page Matters

Before diving deep into writing tests and mocks, it's crucial to grasp the meaning and usage of core entities such as *test cases*, *test suites*, *assertions*, *fixtures*, *mocks*, and more. This shared understanding helps you write tests precisely and leverage the APIs efficiently.

This page defines each concept and directly maps them to the relevant APIs, patterns, or header files you will use daily.

## Key Concepts Defined

### Test Case
A **test case** represents a single unit test — a concrete verification of a specific behavior or outcome in your code. It contains one or more assertions that check the correctness of code under test.

In GoogleTest, a test case is typically declared using the `TEST()` macro:

```cpp
TEST(TestCaseName, TestName) {
  // test logic
  EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
}
```

### Test Suite
A **test suite** is a group of related test cases logically organized under a common name. It helps structure tests by functionality or component.

Within GoogleTest, test suites correspond to the first parameter in the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.

### Assertion
An **assertion** is a statement that verifies a condition or property, such as equality or truth, within a test case.

GoogleTest provides multiple assertion macros:

- `EXPECT_*` macros generate *non-fatal* failures, letting the test continue.
- `ASSERT_*` macros generate *fatal* failures, aborting the current function.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value, 5);  // Passes if value == 5
ASSERT_TRUE(ptr != nullptr);  // Aborts if ptr is null
```

For more, see the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md).

### Fixture
A **test fixture** sets up a common environment for multiple tests—sharing setup and teardown code.

GoogleTest provides `TEST_F()` to associate tests with a fixture class:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* initialization */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* cleanup */ }
  // Shared members
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, Test1) { /* test using fixture */ }
TEST_F(MyFixture, Test2) { /* another test using same fixture */ }
```

### Mock
A **mock** is a special kind of test double that mimics behavior of dependencies, allowing you to specify and verify interactions.

GoogleMock allows building mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros (see below), where you define fake implementations with expectations.

### Matcher
A **matcher** is a predicate or condition that describes the expected arguments in mock method calls.

Built-in matchers include `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `HasSubstr()`, and custom matchers.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Func(Eq(5), _));
```

For details, refer to the [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md).

### Assertion
Beyond basic assertions, broad asserts like `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` allow expressive checks using matchers for nuanced verification.

### Cardinality
**Cardinality** specifies how many times you expect a mock method to be called.

GoogleMock provides cardinalities like:

- `Exactly(n)` - exactly n times
- `AtLeast(n)` - at least n times
- `AtMost(n)` - at most n times
- `AnyNumber()` - no limit
- `Between(m, n)` - between m and n times

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method()).Times(AtLeast(1));
```

### Parameterized and Typed Tests
These allow running the same test logic over multiple sets of parameters or types.

- **Parameterized tests** reuse test code with differing input data.
- **Typed tests** run tests over different types.

Useful for broad coverage without duplicate code.

### Action
Actions define what a mock method actually does when invoked.

Common actions include returning a value, invoking a function, throwing exceptions, or modifying arguments.

Examples:

- `Return(value)` returns a fixed value.
- `Invoke(func)` runs a callback.
- `SetArgPointee<N>(value)` sets the N-th argument's pointee.

### Fixture
A fixture pairs setup and teardown code for specific test suites.

## Common Terms Clarified

### Fatal vs. Non-Fatal Failures
- **Fatal failures** (via ASSERT macros) stop the current test function immediately.
- **Non-fatal failures** (via EXPECT macros) report failure but allow the test function to continue.

Use fatal failures when continuation doesn’t make sense; otherwise prefer non-fatal.

### Mock Types: Nice, Strict, Naggy

- **NiceMock** suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock** treats uninteresting calls as errors.
- **NaggyMock** (default) warns on uninteresting calls.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use **`EXPECT_CALL`** to specify expected calls with argument matchers, call counts (cardinalities), and behaviors.
- Use **`ON_CALL`** to set reasonable default behaviors without specifying that calls must occur.
- Organize related tests using test suites and fixtures to share setup.
- Use matchers to precisely verify arguments without brittleness.
- Use sequences or `After()` clauses to verify call ordering.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to allow expectations to be reused flexibly.
- For complex return scenarios, chain actions using `WillOnce()` and `WillRepeatedly()`.
- Prefer `NiceMock` or explicit expectations over suppressing warnings blindly.
