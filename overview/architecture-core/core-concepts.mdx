# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the fundamental terms and concepts of GoogleTest and GoogleMock is essential for effectively navigating the documentation and writing robust tests. This guide defines key terminology such as test cases, fixtures, assertions, expectations, mocks, death tests, parameterized tests, and the mechanism behind test discovery.

## Introduction

Before diving into the mechanics and syntax of using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, you must become comfortable with the conceptual language that shapes their usage. This page lays the groundwork by defining core terms that appear throughout all documentation and code examples.


## Test Case and Test Fixture

- **Test Case:** A logical grouping of related tests. Each test case contains one or more individual tests.
- **Test Fixture:** A class providing the environment in which tests run, usually setting up and tearing down common objects needed by multiple tests in the group.

GoogleTest encourages the use of test fixtures to share setup and cleanup code among multiple tests, improving readability and maintenance.


## Assertions

Assertions are checks or validations inside tests that verify if conditions hold true during test execution. They serve as the primary mechanism to confirm behavior.

- Examples include:
  - `EXPECT_EQ` to check equality
  - `ASSERT_TRUE` to terminate test on failure
  - Rich matchers allow fine-grained checks on argument values

Assertions enable early detection of bugs by reporting failures as soon as an unexpected condition arises.


## Expectations and Mock Methods

### Expectations

Expectations define how a mock method _should_ be called during a test. They specify:

- The method to be invoked
- Expected argument matchers
- How many times it should be called (cardinality)
- What action to perform when called (return value, side effects)

Expectations _must_ be set before the mock method is invoked, enabling GoogleMock to immediately detect violations.

### Mock Methods

Mock methods are method stubs generated by GoogleMock that mimic real interface methods. They:

- Allow observation and control of calls
- Support complex actions and behaviors
- Facilitate strict verification of interactions


## Matchers

Matchers are predicates used in expectations to specify constraints on method arguments. Instead of matching exact values only, matchers can express ranges, patterns, or properties.

- The wildcard matcher `_` matches any argument.
- Composite matchers allow combining conditions.

Matchers significantly increase test expressiveness by focusing on relevant properties rather than precise literals.


## Actions

Actions define what a mock method does when invoked. The simplest action returns a fixed value, but actions can also:

- Call user-defined functions or lambdas
- Modify output arguments
- Delete pointers
- Invoke callbacks

Actions can be chained and combined for complex behaviors.


## Expectations: Cardinality and Ordering

- **Cardinality:** Defines the expected number of method invocations (e.g., exactly once, at least twice, any number).
- **Ordered Calls:** Using constructs like `InSequence` or `After`, expectations can enforce call order constraints.

GoogleMock allows expressing full or partial orders on expected calls, enabling verification of complex interaction patterns.


## Uninteresting, Unexpected, and Excessive Calls

- **Uninteresting Call:** A call to a mock method that has no expectations set. By default, this results in a warning but allows test continuation.
- **Unexpected Call:** A call that does not match any existing expectation. This is treated as a failure.
- **Excessive Call:** Calling a method more times than the upper bound specified by an expectation, which results in failure.

GoogleMock provides mechanisms (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`) to control how uninteresting calls are treated.


## Mocks: Nice, Naggy, and Strict

- **NaggyMock:** Default behavior instructing GoogleMock to warn on uninteresting calls.
- **NiceMock:** Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls to reduce test output noise.
- **StrictMock:** Treats uninteresting calls as errors, enforcing all calls must be expected.

These wrappers help you tune the strictness of your tests according to your needs.


## Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests written using its macros by scanning for test case and test names. This makes running tests easy without manual registration.


## Death Tests

Death tests verify that your code terminates or crashes as expected under certain conditions.

These tests are isolated and carefully managed by GoogleTest to avoid affecting other tests.


## Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests allow running the same test logic with different input values, promoting code reuse and comprehensive coverage without duplication.


## Example Usage of Core Concepts

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;

class Foo {
public:
  virtual ~Foo() = default;
  virtual int Bar(int x) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x), (override));
};

TEST(FooTest, BarReturnsCorrectValue) {
  MockFoo mock_foo;

  // Setting expectation: Bar(5) should be called exactly once and return 10
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(5)).Times(1).WillOnce(Return(10));

  int result = mock_foo.Bar(5);

  EXPECT_EQ(result, 10);
}
```

Here, a mock class describing `Foo` is declared. An expectation defines how `Bar` is expected to be invoked and what it returns. The test verifies the actual returned value.


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Always set expectations _before_ calling mock methods.
- Beware expectations are "sticky" by default; use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire.
- Overly strict expectations can cause brittle tests.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to diagnose expectation mismatches by tracing mock calls.
- Control warnings on uninteresting calls by choosing appropriate mock wrapper (`NiceMock`, etc).


## Best Practices & Tips

- Start tests with minimal `EXPECT_CALL`s to verify only critical interactions.
- Use wildcards `_` for uninterested arguments to avoid brittle tests.
- Combine `InSequence` and `RetiresOnSaturation` to enforce call order neatly.
- Prefer `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior without expectations when you don't want to verify calls.
- Manage mock object lifecycle carefully to avoid leaks and unsatisfied expectations.
