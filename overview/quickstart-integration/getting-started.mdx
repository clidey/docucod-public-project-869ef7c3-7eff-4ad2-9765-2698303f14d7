# Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the initial step in your journey with GoogleTest: this guide walks you through installing GoogleTest, writing your first test, and running it successfully. If you are new to testing in C++, this is your gateway to understanding how to leverage GoogleTest to improve the quality and reliability of your code.

---

## 1. Installing GoogleTest

Before diving into writing tests, you must install GoogleTest and integrate it into your build environment. GoogleTest supports a variety of build tools and platforms, making it flexible enough to fit into your existing workflow.

### Quick Installation Steps

- Clone the source repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
  cd googletest
  ```

- Build with CMake (recommended):

  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install  # Optional, for system-wide installation
  ```

- If you want **only GoogleTest** without GoogleMock, disable gMock in CMake:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF
  ```

### Integration Notes

GoogleTest integrates well with a variety of build systems:

- **CMake**: Use `add_subdirectory()` or `find_package()` to link your tests
- **Bazel**, **Makefiles**, or IDEs: Add includes and link to the built libraries

Refer to the [Installation & Integration Options](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/googletest) for detailed platform-specific instructions.

## 2. Writing Your First Test

With the library installed, you are ready to write your first test using GoogleTest.

### Basic Test Example

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple function we want to test
int Factorial(int n) {
  return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

// Test Case and Test Name
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(8), 40320);
}
```

### Explanation
- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` declares a test function
- `EXPECT_EQ` asserts that two values are equal and records failure without aborting


## 3. Running Your Tests

GoogleTest provides a test runner that automatically discovers all tests.

### With a Manual `main()`

If your project does not link with the `gtest_main` library, write your own entry point:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Command Line

Build your test executable and run:

```bash
./your_test_executable
```

GoogleTest will execute all tests, reporting successes and failures with useful diagnostic messages and stack traces.

## 4. Useful Tips & Next Steps

- Always call `::testing::InitGoogleTest()` in your main function before running tests to initialize the framework properly.
- Use `EXPECT_` assertions to continue tests after failure and `ASSERT_` assertions to abort on critical failures.
- Group related tests into test suites by using the same first argument in `TEST()` for better organization.

### Where to Go From Here

- Learn how to write mocks using the [Your First Mock: Testing with GoogleMock](https://google.github.io/googletest/guides/getting-started/first-mock-example.html).
- Explore how to configure GoogleTest with various build systems in the [Integration with Build Systems](./integration-options.md).
- Dive deeper into writing assertions and test fixtures in the [Assertions: Verifying Program Behavior](./writing-assertions.md) guide.
- Consult the [GoogleTest Primer](./primer.md) for a thorough introduction to the framework.

## 5. Troubleshooting Installation & Setup

If you encounter any issues during installation or running tests:

- Verify CMake and compiler versions meet GoogleTest requirements.
- Ensure that your include and link paths are correctly set.
- Confirm that your GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions match if using both.

For detailed help, refer to the [Common Installation & Configuration Issues](../getting-started/setup-troubleshooting/common-issues.md).
