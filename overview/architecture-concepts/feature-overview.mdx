# Feature Overview

GoogleTest offers a robust suite of features designed to empower C++ developers with a structured, efficient, and informative testing framework. This overview succinctly presents its principal capabilities, providing a clear picture of what you can achieve with this toolkit.

## Core Testing Paradigm

- **xUnit-Style Testing Framework**
  - Organizes tests systematically into *test suites* and *test cases*, reflecting the structure of your code.
  - Supports fixtures for shared setup and teardown logic, ensuring clean, maintainable test code.

- **Rich Assertions**
  - Comprehensive assertion macros including `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` variants.
  - Enables checking Boolean conditions, equality, inequality, string comparisons, floating-point approximations, and more.
  - Offers streaming of custom failure messages for precise debugging.
  
- **Explicit Success and Failure Indication**
  - `SUCCEED()`, `FAIL()`, `ADD_FAILURE()`, and location-specific failures allow clear signaling of test outcomes.


## Advanced Assertion Capabilities

- **Use of Matchers (`EXPECT_THAT`)**
  - Integrates with rich matcher libraries, enabling readable and expressive assertions.
  - Supports complex checks like string submatches, regex, and value ranges.

- **Predicate Assertions**
  - Custom predicates returning detailed assertion results for clear failure messages.
  - Predicate-format macros for sophisticated customized messages.

- **Exception Assertions**
  - Verify code throws expected exceptions or remains exception-free.

- **Floating-Point Comparisons**
  - Specialized macros (`EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`) using Units in the Last Place (ULPs) for robust approximate equality checks.

- **Windows HRESULT Assertions**
  - Facilities to assert success or failure HRESULT values on Windows platforms.


## Specialized Testing Features

- **Death Tests**
  - Test that code terminates as expected under predefined conditions.
  - Multiple styles available (`fast` and `threadsafe`) balancing performance and thread safety.
  - Supports verification of exit codes and matching output via regex.

- **Parameterized and Typed Tests**
  - Value-parameterized tests enable running the same test logic with multiple input sets seamlessly.
  - Typed tests repeat tests across a list of types to validate type-specific behaviors.
  - Type-parameterized tests offer reusable abstract tests instantiated over different types.
  - Custom generators and combinators available (e.g., `Values`, `Range`, `Combine`).

- **Test Registration and Execution Controls**
  - Tests automatically registered with no manual enumeration.
  - Ability to programmatically register tests with factories.
  - Supports running subsets of tests with filters and sharding for distributed execution.
  - Offers test repeat and shuffle capabilities to catch flaky or order-dependent tests.


## Diagnostic and Reporting Enhancements

- **Detailed Failure Messages and Traces**
  - Supports streaming extra context to assertions.
  - `SCOPED_TRACE` and `ScopedTrace` provide hierarchical trace messages, aiding in locating failure sources.

- **Test Properties and Metadata**
  - Ability to log arbitrary key/value pairs related to tests.
  - These properties are reported in XML and JSON test reports.

- **Output Control and Event Listening**
  - Customizable output through event listeners.
  - Control over console output verbosity, colors, XML/JSON reports.

- **Cross-Platform Support and Integration**
  - Runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac with consistent APIs.
  - Compatibility with various compilers and build systems.


## Practical Example: Basic Test Declaration

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

TEST(MathTest, Subtraction) {
  ASSERT_EQ(10 - 5, 5) << "Simple subtraction test failed.";
}
```


## Why These Features Matter

- Provides clarity and precision when specifying test expectations.
- Facilitates maintenance and scaling of test suites using parameterization and typing.
- Enables robust testing of edge cases, including abnormal termination and exception handling.
- Supports diagnostic effectiveness with rich reporting and failure context.


## Getting Started

To begin experiencing these features, start with the [`GoogleTest Primer`](overview/getting-started-intro/what-is-googletest) and explore the [`Assertions Reference`](docs/reference/assertions.md) for detailed macros. Then, delve into advanced concepts like parameterized and death tests to broaden your testing strategy.
