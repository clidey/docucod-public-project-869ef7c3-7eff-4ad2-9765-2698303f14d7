# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to your essential glossary for GoogleTest. This documentation page demystifies the core jargon and concepts you will encounter when using GoogleTest, presenting them in clear, accessible language to accelerate your onboarding and improve your testing fluency.

---

## Test Case and Test Suite

- **Test Case** is an older term from legacy testing frameworks, now largely synonymous with **Test Suite** in GoogleTest.
- **Test Suite** groups together related tests into a collection. It helps you organize tests logically, such as all tests for a particular class or module.
- Each test in a suite shares a common context and setup, enabling reusable test fixtures.

**Example:** A `MathTests` suite containing individual tests like `AdditionWorks` and `DivisionByZeroThrows`.

---

## Test and Test Fixture

- A **Test** is a single, focused unit of testing that checks one particular behavior or condition.
- A **Test Fixture** is a class that sets up and tears down the environment shared by multiple tests. It encapsulates common setup code like initializing objects or preparing test data.

**User flow:** You create a test fixture by deriving from `::testing::Test`, write setup code in `SetUp()`, and write multiple `TEST_F` tests to use that fixture.

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup here
  }
};

TEST_F(MyTest, FirstTest) {
  // Test code
}
```

---

## Assertions

Assertions evaluate test conditions and report success or failure. GoogleTest offers many assertions, such as:

- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` — checks equality but continues test on failure.
- `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` — checks a condition and aborts the current test on failure.

These are the fundamental building blocks to verify that your code behaves as expected.

---

## Matchers

Matchers provide expressive, flexible ways to specify argument expectations in mocks or perform complex assertions.

- Used mainly with `EXPECT_THAT()` and mocking.
- Examples include `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `NotNull()`, and compound matchers like `AllOf()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(actual_vector, ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

---

## Death Test

Death tests verify that code terminates in a controlled way under certain conditions (e.g., calls `exit()`, crashes, or triggers assertions). They are critical to test fatal failure scenarios.

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH()` or `ASSERT_DEATH()` macros.
- GoogleTest provides mechanisms to isolate and safely run these tests.

---

## Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests by scanning linked binaries for special macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc.) during runtime initialization.

- This eliminates manual registration of tests.
- You can run individual tests, whole suites, or filtered groups easily.

---

## Why These Concepts Matter

Understanding these concepts lets you write well-organized, expressive tests and use mocking and advanced expectations effectively.
This glossary turns GoogleTest jargon into actionable knowledge so you can focus on creating robust tests.

---

## Practical Tips

- Prefer **test suites** over legacy test cases to group tests.
- Use **test fixtures** to reduce repetitive setup and teardown steps.
- Write clear assertions with meaningful failure messages.
- Use **matchers** for flexible argument validation in mocks and assertions.
- Leverage **death tests** responsibly to capture fatal failure behaviors.

### Example of a Test Suite with Fixture and Assertions

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    calculator = new Calculator();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    delete calculator;
  }

  Calculator* calculator;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsTwoNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(calculator->Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, SubtractsTwoNumbers) {
  ASSERT_EQ(calculator->Subtract(10, 4), 6);
}
```
