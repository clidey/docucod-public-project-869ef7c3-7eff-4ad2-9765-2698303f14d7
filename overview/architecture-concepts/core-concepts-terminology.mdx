# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the fundamental domain concepts in GoogleTest and GoogleMock is crucial to writing effective tests and mocks. This document unpacks the most important terms and constructs that make up the GoogleTest framework and its mocking extension, GoogleMock. You'll learn about test cases, fixtures, assertions, mocks, expectations, and matchers, along with advanced topics like death tests and parameterized tests.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Test Cases and Test Suites

Historically, GoogleTest used *Test Case* to group related tests. With evolving terminology, the preferred term is now *Test Suite*. A test suite is a collection of related tests structured to facilitate organized and maintainable testing efforts. 

Each individual test belongs to a test suite and is executed independently, ensuring isolation and repeatability.

### Test Fixtures

Test fixtures allow you to establish a common environment for multiple tests within the same suite. By creating a fixture as a class derived from `testing::Test`, you can initialize shared objects in `SetUp()` and clean resources in `TearDown()`.

This reuse of setup prepares a consistent state before each test, reducing redundancy and improving clarity.

### Assertions

Assertions are the fundamental verification points within tests. GoogleTest differentiates between **fatal** (`ASSERT_*`) and **non-fatal** (`EXPECT_*`) assertions, allowing flexible test continuation policies.

Examples include basic condition checks, equality, inequality, string comparisons, floating-point approximate equality, and more advanced predicates.

### Mocks and Mock Objects

GoogleMock provides facilities to create *mock classes* to simulate the behavior of real dependencies. 

Mock methods are defined using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to specify mocked functions within a class. This enables you to control and verify interactions in isolation.

### Expectations and Behavior Control

Expectations like those declared with `EXPECT_CALL` specify the anticipated function calls on mock objects with precise argument matching, call counts, and ordering.

Modifier clauses such as `.Times()`, `.InSequence()`, `.WillOnce()`, and `.RetiresOnSaturation()` empower detailed behavioral specifications.

### Matchers

Matchers describe argument constraints for mock function expectations, allowing granular filtering of expected calls. 

GoogleMock provides built-in matchers (`_` for wildcard, `Eq()`, `Lt()`, `Ne()`, among others) and supports composing matchers for tuples and complex types.

### Death Tests

Death tests verify that code terminates under specific error conditions, validating expected crash scenarios.

They help test code robustness, especially for fatal failures or assert-based checks.

### Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

Value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) run the same test logic with multiple input values, provided via generators like `Values()`, `Range()`, or `Combine()`.

Type-parameterized tests (`TYPED_TEST`) enable running tests over different types, testing templates and polymorphic code.

This capability broadens test coverage with concise code.

### Distinctions Between GoogleTest and GoogleMock

- **GoogleTest** provides core testing capabilities: test registration, assertions, fixtures, and test execution.
- **GoogleMock** extends GoogleTest with advanced mocking features: mock objects, expectations, matchers, and behavior control.

Both projects are maintained and released together, forming a cohesive testing solution.

## Navigating Terminology in Practice

Here are concrete examples illustrating how these concepts come together.

### Defining a Test Suite and a Test
```cpp
// Define a simple test
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

### Using a Test Fixture
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}
```

### Declaring a Mock Method
```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetRecordCount, (), (const));
};
```

### Setting an Expectation with Behavior
```cpp
using ::testing::Return;

MockDatabase mock_db;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("localhost"))
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

### Parameterized Tests
```cpp
class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  int value = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(value % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenValues, MyParamTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

## Practical Tips

- Always declare mock methods in the `public:` section for accessibility.
- Wrap argument types containing commas in extra parentheses or use type aliases when using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Use `.Times()` thoughtfully to avoid fragile or overly strict tests.
- Leverage parameterized tests to reduce code duplication while broadening coverage.
- Understand when to use `EXPECT_*` versus `ASSERT_*` based on whether you want the test to continue after failure.
