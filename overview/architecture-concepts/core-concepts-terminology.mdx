# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Understanding GoogleTest's Essential Terms

This documentation defines and explains pivotal GoogleTest concepts such as **test case**, **assertion**, **fixture**, **death test**, **parameterized test**, and **mock**. We connect these ideas directly to the relevant components, helping new users demystify testing jargon and begin confidently using GoogleTest.

## Key Terms Defined

### Test Case
A **test case** in GoogleTest is a named collection of related tests. Each test case groups multiple test functions that verify aspects of a particular feature or functionality. For example, if you are testing a `Calculator` class, your test case could be named `CalculatorTest`.

**What it enables:**
- Organizes tests logically for easier management.
- Supports running sets of related tests together.

### Assertion
An **assertion** is a statement that checks a condition in a test and determines whether the test should continue, fail, or stop based on the result. GoogleTest provides various assertion macros like `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_TRUE()`, and more.

**Why it matters:**
- Validates that code behaves as expected.
- Different assertion types control test flow (soft vs. hard failures).

### Fixture
A **test fixture** is a class used to set up and tear down common objects and state for tests. It allows reusing setup code across multiple tests in the same test case. Test fixtures inherit from `testing::Test` and implement `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods.

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates code duplication.
- Ensures test isolation and consistent environment.

### Death Test
A **death test** verifies that your program crashes or terminates in a controlled way under invalid or fatal conditions, such as invalid inputs or failed assertions inside the code under test.

**Use case:**
- Confirm the program enforces safety checks.
- Prevent regressions in error handling.

### Parameterized Test
A **parameterized test** lets you write a single test logic that runs over multiple sets of input parameters. It increases test coverage without duplicating code.

**Key advantages:**
- Validate behavior across a range of inputs efficiently.
- Supports typed tests and value-parameterized tests.

### Mock
A **mock** object is a simulated version of a real class used in tests to verify interactions and define custom behavior. GoogleTest provides **GoogleMock**, an integrated framework for creating mock classes, setting expectations, and validating interactions.

**What mocks enable:**
- Decoupling tests from external dependencies.
- Specifying and verifying interactions between components.
- Controlling test scenarios precisely.

|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Case         | `TEST()`, `TEST_F()` macros                  | Defines individual tests and tests with fixtures          |
| Assertion         | Assertion macros (`EXPECT_*`, `ASSERT_*`)   | Check and verify conditions within tests                   |
| Fixture           | Classes derived from `testing::Test`         | Setup for shared test environment and reusable objects    |
| Death Test        | `ASSERT_DEATH()`, `EXPECT_DEATH()` macros    | Tests expected program termination under failure          |
| Parameterized Test| `TEST_P()`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`    | Parameter-driven test execution                             |
| Mock              | GoogleMock (`gmock/gmock.h`, `MOCK_METHOD`) | Create mock classes, set expectations on behavior & calls |

## Best Practices & Tips

- Always use fixtures to share test setup and ensure clean environments.
- When verifying failure scenarios, use death tests with care and isolate them.
- Prefer parameterized tests instead of writing similar tests for different inputs.
- Use mocks to isolate your tests from external dependencies or hard-to-reproduce conditions.
- In mocks, clearly specify expectations with cardinalities like `Times()`, and avoid over-specification to reduce brittle tests.

## Example: Applying Core Concepts

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// The class to test
class Calculator {
 public:
  int Add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
};

// Test fixture for Calculator tests
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator calc;
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddsTwoNumbers) {
  // An assertion
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(1, 2), 3);
}

// Mock example: mocking a dependency (hypothetical for illustration)
class MockDependency {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), ());
};

TEST(MockExample, UsesMock) {
  MockDependency mock;
  // Setting expectation with WillOnce()
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue()).WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(), 42);
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Pain Points

- **Confusing Terminology:** Revisit this page whenever a term puzzles you.
- **Assertion Failures:** Check your test output messages and ensure input matches expected assertions.
- **Mock Expectations Mismatch:** Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to diagnose why calls fail to match expectations.
- **Death Tests Fail Silently:** Ensure your death tests are properly isolated and follow GoogleTest's requirements.
