# Fundamental Concepts & Terminology

Acquiring a deep understanding of the foundational concepts and terminology used in GoogleTest, particularly within its GoogleMock (gMock) framework, is essential for effective C++ testing workflows. This page serves as an indispensable resource for teams aiming to build a shared language and to streamline collaboration around testing practices.

## Why Understanding These Concepts Matters

Testing C++ code with GoogleMock is more than just writing mock classes and expectations. It demands a clear grasp of several key concepts – including what defines a **test**, how **test fixtures** organize test code, the role of **assertions** and **matchers** in validating behavior, and the use of **mocks** to simulate dependencies.

Each of these elements fits into the bigger picture of an effective testing workflow, enabling more maintainable, reliable, and expressive tests.

## Core Terminology and Concepts

### Tests
- The basic unit of verification, a **test** exercises a piece of code under controlled conditions and verifies its behavior using assertions.
- Tests can be grouped logically using **test fixtures** for setup and teardown, enabling reuse and cleaner tests.

### Test Fixtures
- A **test fixture** is a class that prepares the environment for a set of related tests, providing shared setup, cleanup, and utilities.
- This promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, ensuring consistent and maintainable test organization.

### Assertions
- **Assertions** are statements within tests that validate expected outcomes.
- GoogleTest offers rich assertion macros, such as `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE`, to confirm values or program state.

### Matchers
- **Matchers** generalize the concept of assertions by providing expressive predicates to match arguments in mocks.
- GoogleMock includes combinable matchers like `Eq()`, `Ge()` (greater or equal), `_` (wildcard), as well as facilities to define custom matchers.
- They enable precise control over the values and properties of mock method call arguments.

### Mocks
- **Mocks** are simulated versions of real objects created using `MOCK_METHOD` macros, allowing control over method behavior and expectations on how methods are called.
- They provide behavior-driven interfaces to verify interactions in the code under test.
- Mock objects enable setting expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`, defining how mock methods should behave.

### Cardinalities
- **Cardinalities** specify how many times a mock method is expected to be called.
- Common examples include `Times(AnyNumber())`, `Times(Exactly(n))`, and `Times(AtLeast(n))`.
- They help enforce correct call counts and interaction patterns in the code.

## How These Concepts Fit into Testing Workflows

A typical test workflow in GoogleMock involves:

1. **Define Interfaces and Mock Classes:**
   - Design your interfaces with virtual functions.
   - Create mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` macros for virtual methods.

2. **Set Up Test Fixtures:**
   - Group related tests using fixtures that manage shared test state.

3. **Specify Expectations and Behavior:**
   - Use `EXPECT_CALL` to define what mock methods are expected to be called, with which arguments, how many times, and what they should return.
   - Use matchers to express argument constraints precisely.

4. **Exercise Code Under Test:**
   - Run your production code using the mocks.
   - Tests automatically verify expectations as they run.

5. **Review Test Outcomes:**
   - GoogleMock reports failures immediately upon unmet expectations.

## Key Relationships and Best Practices

- Always mock interfaces or virtual methods to avoid unwanted side effects and dependencies.
- Use matchers effectively to avoid overspecification that leads to brittle tests.
- Control cardinalities thoughtfully to balance between ensuring correctness and test maintainability.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers to manage warnings or strictness levels for uninteresting calls.
- Organize tests using fixtures to share setup and promote clarity.

## Concrete Example: Defining Mocks and Expectations

Here’s how you mock a simple class and specify expectations using GoogleMock:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

// Test example
TEST(DrawTest, DrawsCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  // Expect PenDown to be called once
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
  // Allow any call to Forward with distance >= 0
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(testing::Ge(0)))
      .Times(testing::AtLeast(1));

  // Your painter code using turtle goes here
  // ...
}
```

## Special Terminology Clarifications

- **Uninteresting Calls:** Calls to mock methods not specified by `EXPECT_CALL`.
  *Warnings* are printed by default. Use `NiceMock` to suppress them or `StrictMock` to treat them as errors.

- **Expectations vs Default Actions:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` for calls *you want to verify*; use `ON_CALL` to specify *default behavior* without asserting that a call must occur.

- **Delegating Calls:** Mocks can delegate their default behavior to a fake or real object to combine behavior fidelity with test verification.

- **Mocking Non-Virtual Methods:** Possible via templates, but recommended to mock virtual methods for better test design.

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- Ensure all virtual methods are mocked publicly even if base methods are private or protected.
- Wrap return or argument types containing commas in parentheses or use typedefs to avoid macro parsing errors.
- Use sequences (`InSequence`) to enforce call order when that is critical.
- Avoid overspecifying. Too many `EXPECT_CALL` constraints can make tests brittle.
- When mocking overloaded methods, mock every overload to avoid compiler warnings, or use `using` to bring base methods into scope.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation` to make expectations non-sticky and avoid test failures due to upper bound violation.
- Use GoogleMock's verbose mode (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to debug why certain calls are or are not matching expectations.

## Next Steps

You now have the shared vocabulary to approach GoogleMock testing with confidence. To deepen your mastery:

- Proceed to the [gMock Cookbook](/docs/gmock_cook_book.md) for practical recipes.
- Review the [Mocking Cheat Sheet](/docs/gmock_cheat_sheet.md) for quick reference.
- Explore the [Mocking API Reference](/api-reference/mocking-apis/mock-object-definition) for details on APIs like `EXPECT_CALL` and `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Consult the [Mocking FAQ](/docs/gmock_faq.md) for solutions to common challenges.

Harness these foundational concepts, and your team will write clearer, more effective C++ tests using GoogleMock with ease.
