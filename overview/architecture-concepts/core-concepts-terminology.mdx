# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to an essential overview of the foundational ideas that power GoogleTest. This page introduces you to the core concepts and terminology that frame everything you do when writing tests, organizing test cases, managing fixtures, making assertions, running parameterized tests, and working with mocks.

Understanding these concepts is the key to effectively leveraging GoogleTest to write clean, maintainable, and powerful C++ tests.

---

## Why Core Concepts Matter

Before diving into actual test writing, grasping the core testing concepts helps you align your intent with GoogleTest's design. It transforms the testing process into a workflow where you clearly specify:

- What you want to test (test cases and fixtures)
- How to verify results (assertions)
- How to run tests for different data sets (parameterized testing)
- How to isolate components and track behavior (mocking)

Knowing the terminology also opens the door to advanced testing techniques and deeper understanding of test results.

## 1. Test Cases and Test Fixtures

### What Is a Test Case?
A test case is a grouping mechanism for logically related tests. Think of it as a collection of scenarios verifying a specific component or functionality.

### What Is a Test Fixture?
A test fixture is the common environment you create for multiple tests within a test case. It can initialize shared data, allocate resources, and clean up afterward. This ensures each test runs under known, consistent conditions.

### Example: Simple Test Fixture
```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize data
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
  }
  int shared_value_ = 42;
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestA) {
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_value_, 42);
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestB) {
  shared_value_++;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_value_, 43);
}
```

Here, `MyTestFixture` prepares the context for tests `TestA` and `TestB`. Each test starts with the fixture’s `SetUp` run, followed by the test body, then `TearDown`.

---

## 2. Assertions

Assertions verify that expected conditions hold true. GoogleTest provides a rich suite of assertion macros:

- `EXPECT_*`: Continue test on failure (non-fatal)
- `ASSERT_*`: Abort current test on failure (fatal)

### Examples:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(value1, value2);  // Checks equality; test continues if fails
ASSERT_TRUE(ptr != nullptr);  // Aborts on failure
```

GoogleTest also supports detailed assertions, custom messages, and predicate assertions for expressive validation.

---

## 3. Parameterized Testing

Sometimes you want to test the same behavior for multiple inputs without duplicating code.

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests that run the same test logic with different input values.

### Example: Value-Parameterized Test
```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyParamTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

Each instantiation runs the `IsEven` test with values 2, 4, 6, and 8.

---

## 4. The Role of Mocks

Mock objects are *test doubles* that look and behave like real objects but record how they are used.

GoogleMock, included with GoogleTest, allows you to define mocks, set expectations on their methods (calls, arguments, order), and verify them automatically.

### Why Use Mocks?

- Isolate the unit of work by replacing dependencies
- Simulate various behaviors including failures
- Verify that interaction protocols are observed

### Example: Defining a Mock
```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(MyTest, UsesMock) {
  MockFoo foo;
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, GetSize()).WillOnce(Return(10));
  EXPECT_EQ(foo.GetSize(), 10);
}
```

Mocks enable interaction-based testing where you verify *how* code is used rather than just validating the end result.

## Summary of Key Terminology

| Term            | Definition                                                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Case       | A suite grouping multiple related tests                           |
| Test Fixture    | Setup and teardown common environment for tests                   |
| Test            | An individual scenario verifying expected behavior               |
| Assertion       | A statement verifying expected conditions during a test           |
| Parameterized Test | A test that runs multiple times with different input parameters |
| Mocks           | Test doubles that replace real objects to verify interaction     |

## Best Practices

- Structure tests with clear fixtures to avoid duplication.
- Use assertions to target specific verification points.
- Leverage parameterized tests to reduce redundant code.
- Use mocks prudently to focus tests on units, not on external dependencies.
