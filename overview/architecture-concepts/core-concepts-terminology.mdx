# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational terms and concepts in GoogleTest is essential for effectively writing, organizing, and interpreting your tests. This page familiarizes you with the key terminology you will encounter: tests, test cases, test fixtures, assertions, death tests, parameterized tests, mock objects, matchers, and cardinalities. Grasping these concepts will clarify how tests are structured and how GoogleTest works under the hood to verify your code behaves as expected.

---

## Tests and Test Cases

At the heart of GoogleTest are *tests*, which are organized collections of code designed to verify a particular aspect of your program.

- **Test Case**: A logical grouping of related tests. It often corresponds to the component or feature under test.
- **Test**: The smallest unit of testing, designed to verify one behavior or condition.

GoogleTest encourages organizing your tests into these assemblies so you can systematically check your codebase by feature or module.

### Example

Imagine you have a `Calculator` class:

```cpp
TEST(CalculatorTest, AddsNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST(CalculatorTest, SubtractsNumbers) {
  Calculator calc;
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Subtract(5, 3), 2);
}
```

Here, `CalculatorTest` is the test case name grouping related tests, with each `TEST` macro defining an individual test.

## Test Fixtures

To avoid repeating common setup and cleanup code for multiple tests, GoogleTest provides *test fixtures*.

A *test fixture* is a class that inherits from `::testing::Test` and contains:

- Setup code executed before each test.
- Common objects and variables used by multiple tests.
- Cleanup code executed after each test.

### Scenario

Suppose multiple tests need to verify behaviors of a database connection:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }
  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryReturnsResults) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Query("SELECT * FROM users"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertWorks) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Insert("INSERT INTO users VALUES ('Alice')"));
}
```

Tests use `TEST_F` instead of `TEST` to run in the context of the fixture.

## Assertions

Assertions are the fundamental verification mechanism in tests. They check that specific conditions are true or false, and determine the test outcome.

- Assertions such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, and `EXPECT_NE` verify expressions.
- `EXPECT_` assertions continue test execution even if they fail, while `ASSERT_` assertions will abort the current test immediately upon failure.

Careful use of assertions helps isolate failures and provide detailed feedback for debugging.

## Death Tests

Sometimes you want to verify that your program behaves correctly under fatal failure conditions (e.g., invalid inputs causing a program crash). GoogleTest supports *death tests* to handle this.

- A death test runs a test in a separate process.
- It checks that the tested code terminates or crashes (via `CHECK`, `assert`, or exceptions).
- You specify the expected failure message pattern.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(SomeFatalTest, FailsOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_DEATH({ MyFunction(-1); }, "Invalid argument");
}
```

These tests ensure your program fails safely and predictably.

## Parameterized Tests

To test the same logic with multiple inputs, GoogleTest offers *parameterized tests*.

- You define a test case that takes parameters.
- You provide multiple input values.
- GoogleTest automatically instantiates individual tests for each parameter.

This approach avoids code duplication and ensures comprehensive coverage.

Example:

```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsEven(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

## Mock Objects

When testing a module that depends on other components (e.g., databases, networks), it’s often impractical or slow to use the real dependencies. *Mock objects* simulate these dependencies.

- A mock object implements the same interface as the real object.
- You program the mock with *expectations* specifying how it should be used.
- The mock verifies if these expectations are met during test execution.

GoogleMock (gMock) is GoogleTest’s integrated framework for creating and managing mocks.

## Matchers

Matchers tell GoogleMock *what arguments* to expect on mock method calls.

- A matcher can specify exact values, ranges, wildcards, or complex predicates.
- Built-in matchers include `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()` (greater or equal), `HasSubstr()`, and many more.
- Combined matchers can be built using logical combinators like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetValue(Ge(0)));  // Expect SetValue called with an argument >= 0
```

## Cardinalities

Cardinalities define *how many times* a mock method is expected to be called.

You can specify them with `Times()` as part of an `EXPECT_CALL()`.

Common cardinalities:

- `Times(0)`: The method should never be called.
- `Times(1)`: Called exactly once.
- `AtLeast(n)`: Called at least *n* times.
- `AtMost(n)`: Called at most *n* times.
- `Between(m, n)`: Called between *m* and *n* times inclusive.
- `AnyNumber()`: Called any number of times.

Using correct cardinalities ensures your tests neither over- nor under-specify behavior, making them resilient and accurate.

## How These Concepts Work Together

Imagine a team developing a complex module. They'll write *test cases* grouping related tests that each perform clear assertions about the code’s behavior. When components depend on external resources or other modules, they'll replace them with *mock objects* created using gMock, which are programmed with *expectations* involving specific *matchers* and *cardinalities*. Some tests require validating behavior on invalid input, handled by *death tests*. For shared setup or teardown, *test fixtures* keep their code DRY and maintainable. For repetitive tests with varying inputs, *parameterized tests* ensure completeness.

These core concepts form the backbone of GoogleTest’s power and flexibility.
