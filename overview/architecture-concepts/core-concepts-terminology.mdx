# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Introduction

Understanding key concepts and terminology is essential for efficiently using GoogleTest. This page introduces and clarifies critical domain-specific terms such as test fixtures, assertions, mocks, matchers, parameterized tests, and cardinalities. Mastery of these will smooth your onboarding and empower effective test writing and maintenance.

---

## Test Fixtures

A **test fixture** is a class derived from `testing::Test` that sets up the common context for multiple tests. It allows you to write related tests that share objects, data, and subroutines without duplicating setup and teardown code in each test.

- Each test within a fixture runs on a **fresh instance** of the fixture class, ensuring isolation and repeatability.
- You can override the fixture's `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods to initialize and clean up shared resources before and after each test respectively.

### Why Use Test Fixtures?

Imagine you need to test a queue implementation. Instead of repeating the initialization of queues in every test, you create a fixture that prepares several queue instances with specific states. Each test then focuses on validating behavior, confident the data setup is consistent and isolated.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q0_ = Queue<int>(); // empty queue
    q1_.Enqueue(1);    // one element queue
    q2_.Enqueue(2);    // two element queue
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  // ...
  delete n;
}
```

## Assertions

**Assertions** are the core mechanism to verify program behavior in tests. GoogleTest provides macros such as `EXPECT_*` for nonfatal checks that allow tests to continue, and `ASSERT_*` for fatal checks that abort the current test function on failure.

### Key Points

- Assertions compare values, check conditions, or validate behavior.
- When a fatal assertion fails, the current test function *returns early* to prevent running further code that depends on that condition.
- To add more information on failure, you can append a stream message.

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors differ in size";
EXPECT_TRUE(container.Contains(element)) << "Missing expected element";
```

Refer to the [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md) for a full list and usage.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports *parameterized* and *typed* tests to help you write tests that run multiple times with different inputs or types.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

- Allow you to run the same test logic with multiple data values.
- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` macros with generators like `Values()` or `Range()`.
- Useful for data-driven testing without code duplication.

Example:

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, ReturnsCorrectFactorial) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), ExpectedFactorials[n]);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Factorials,
                         FactorialTest,
                         testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 8));
```

### Typed Tests

- Useful for testing templates or different implementations that share behavior.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` macros.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyContainerTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T container_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<std::vector<int>, std::list<int>>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyContainerTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyContainerTest, IsEmptyOnCreation) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(this->container_.empty());
}
```

For deeper understanding, see [Parameterized and Typed Tests](advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) and [Testing Reference](reference/testing.md).

## Mocks and Matchers

### Mocks

Mocks are **simulated objects** that mimic the behavior of real objects. They allow you to:

- Verify that certain methods are called with expected arguments.
- Control the behavior of dependencies during testing.

GoogleMock is the mocking framework integrated with GoogleTest.

Example definition of a mock method:

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int x), (const));
};
```

You specify expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` and behaviors with actions like `Return()` or `Throw()`.

### Matchers

Matchers define how arguments of mock methods are compared during expectation matching.
Common matchers include:

- `_` (wildcard matcher, matches anything)
- `Eq(value)` (equality)
- `Lt(value)`, `Gt(value)` (less than, greater than)
- `HasSubstr(str)` (string contains substring)

Match matchers precisely to ensure your tests fail correctly and meaningfully.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(Eq(5))).WillOnce(Return(10));
```

For comprehensive details, see the [Mocking Reference](docs/reference/mocking.md).

## Cardinalities

When setting expectations on mock calls, **cardinalities** specify how many times a method is expected to be invoked. GoogleMock provides different cardinalities:

| Cardinality         | Description                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `AnyNumber()`       | Method can be called any number of times.      |
| `Exactly(n)`        | Method is expected to be called exactly `n` times. |
| `AtLeast(n)`        | Method is expected to be called at least `n` times. |
| `AtMost(n)`         | Method is expected to be called at most `n` times. |
| `Between(m, n)`     | Method is expected to be called between `m` and `n` times (inclusive). |

By default, if no cardinality is specified, expected call count is inferred from actions used with `WillOnce()` or set to 1.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(_)).Times(AtLeast(2));
```

| Typed Test          | Test case repeated for multiple types (templates or different implementations).|
| Mock                | A simulated object to test interactions and expectations in isolation.        |
| Matcher             | Predicate used by mocks to validate method call arguments.                   |
