# Quick Feature Overview

GoogleTest equips C++ developers with a powerful set of tools for building reliable, readable, and maintainable tests efficiently. This page highlights the core features that streamline your testing workflow—from compelling assertions to advanced parameterized and typed tests, seamless automatic test discovery, robust mock support via GoogleMock, and flexible controls for executing your test runs.

## Rich Assertions for Clearer Tests

GoogleTest offers a vast array of _assertions_ that validate conditions crucial to your code’s correctness. These assertions help you express precise expectations in your tests clearly and succinctly:

- **Boolean Checks:** Verify true or false conditions with macros like `EXPECT_TRUE` and `ASSERT_FALSE`.
- **Equality and Relation Checks:** Use `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `EXPECT_LT`, and others to compare values.
- **String Comparisons:** Compare strings safely with specialized assertions.
- **Floating-Point Comparisons:** Handle approximations with floating-point specific checks.
- **Custom Assertions:** Define your own conditions using predicates and matchers.

These assertions produce detailed, actionable failure messages with source locations to help you quickly diagnose issues.

> **Example:**
> ```cpp
> TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
>   EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
>   EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
>   EXPECT_NE(Factorial(4), 23);  // intentionally incorrect to demonstrate failure
> }
> ```


## Parameterized and Typed Tests: Scalable Test Coverage

Eliminate repetitive tests by leveraging GoogleTest’s parameterized and typed tests features:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with different input values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Run test suites against multiple data types to ensure template code correctness.
- **Flexible Instantiation:** Generate test instances programmatically with helpful naming to map test cases easily.

These capabilities empower you to cover edge cases and complex test inputs while keeping your test code DRY and elegant.

> **Example:**
> ```cpp
> class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};
>
> TEST_P(IsEvenTest, HandlesEvenNumbers) {
>   EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
> }
>
> INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
> ```


## Automatic Test Discovery: Run Tests with Zero Configuration

GoogleTest detects all your tests at runtime through the use of registration macros and reflection, eliminating the need for manual enumeration or registration:

- Tests defined with `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and typed test macros are discovered automatically.
- Supports filtering tests by name or patterns via command-line flags.
- Enables running individual tests or selected groups without rebuilding.

This hands-off approach lets you focus solely on test writing and execution.


## Mock Support via GoogleMock: Control Collaborator Behavior

GoogleMock seamlessly integrates with GoogleTest to provide a sophisticated mocking framework for C++:

- **Intuitive Mock Classes:** Define mock versions of your interfaces quickly using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- **Flexible Expectations:** Specify expected calls, argument matchers, invocation counts, and call ordering.
- **Powerful Actions:** Define mock behavior including return values, side effects, and delegation.
- **Match Argument Values:** Use built-in and custom matchers for granular argument validation.
- **Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks:** Control verbosity and strictness of mock enforcement.

This combination unlocks powerful interaction-based testing to precisely verify dependencies.

> **Example:**
> ```cpp
> class MockTurtle {
>  public:
>   MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
>   MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
> };
>
> TEST(DrawTest, MovesForward) {
>   MockTurtle turtle;
>   EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
>   EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
>   // exercise code that uses turtle...
> }
> ```


## Flexible Test Run Control

GoogleTest provides command-line flags and API for controlling how, when, and which tests run:

- **Filtering:** Run specific tests matching name patterns.
- **Sharding:** Distribute test suites/tests across multiple machines or processes.
- **Repeated Runs:** Repeat tests to catch flaky behavior.
- **Randomized Order:** Randomize test execution order for robustness.
- **XML and JSON Output:** Generate detailed reports for CI environments.
- **Skip and Disable Tests:** Mark tests to be conditionally excluded.

Together, these controls enable smooth integration with CI pipelines and extensive test execution strategies.
