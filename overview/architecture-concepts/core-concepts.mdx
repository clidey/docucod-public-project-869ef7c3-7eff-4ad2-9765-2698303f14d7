# Core Concepts & Terminology

Unlock the foundational language and workflows of GoogleTest to confidently write, organize, and reason about your C++ tests. This page demystifies essential terms like assertions, test fixtures, test cases, test suites, parameterized and typed tests, death tests, mocks, and expectations, empowering you to harness GoogleTest effectively.

## Understanding the Building Blocks of GoogleTest

GoogleTest provides a rich vocabulary and structured workflow to help you model your tests clearly and reuse testing logic efficiently. This foundation ensures your tests are easily maintainable, readable, and powerful enough to cover complex scenarios.

### Assertions: The Heart of Verification

- **What they are:** Statements that check whether a condition holds true.
- **Their result:** Can be _success_, _nonfatal failure_ (test continues), or _fatal failure_ (test aborts immediately).
- **Use cases:** Confirm expected outcomes like value equality, exceptions thrown, or specific conditions met.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Failure message on mismatch";
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr) << "Pointer should not be null";
```

### Test Fixtures: Share Setup Across Tests

When multiple tests require the same setup or initial configuration, create a **test fixture** class derived from `testing::Test`. Fixtures encapsulate the reusable objects and setup/teardown logic:

- Each test uses a fresh fixture instance to maintain test independence.
- Setup/teardown happens via `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`, or via constructor/destructor.

Example:
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    // Initialize for tests
  }

  Queue<int> q0_, q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

### Test Cases and Test Suites: Organizing Your Tests

- **Test** (sometimes historically called Test Case in GoogleTest): An individual testing function verifying a specific behavior.
- **Test Suite:** A collection of related tests, often sharing a fixture.

This structure aligns with common testing practices to group logically related tests.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);
}

TEST(MathTest, Subtraction) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Subtract(5, 3), 2);
}
```
Here, `MathTest` is the test suite containing two tests: `Addition` and `Subtraction`.

### Parameterized Tests: Reuse Tests Across Inputs or Types

#### Value-Parameterized Tests

Run the same test logic multiple times with different input values without duplicating code.

- Define a test fixture by inheriting from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is your parameter type.
- Use `TEST_P` macros for defining tests that use the parameter via `GetParam()`.
- Instantiate the suite with sets of parameters using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

Example:
```cpp
class MyParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Evens, MyParamTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

#### Typed Tests

Run tests over multiple types, useful to verify different implementations of an interface or generic code.

- Define a template fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Associate a list of types via `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.
- Write tests using `TYPED_TEST` and refer to the type as `TypeParam`.

Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(FooTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(FooTest, DoesSomething) {
  TypeParam val = this->value_;
  // test body
}
```

#### Type-Parameterized Tests

Provide an abstract set of type-based tests to be instantiated multiple times.

- Use macros like `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P` to declare pattern tests.
- Register tests via `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Instantiate using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` with desired type lists.

### Death Tests: Verifying Process Termination

GoogleTest supports tests that check whether code terminates a process under certain conditions, ensuring correctness of error handling and exceptional states.

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH` macros.
- Death tests run in child processes to keep the test runner alive.
- These tests confirm if a statement causes the program to exit or crash and optionally verify the messages printed during failure.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, CrashesOnNull) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(MyFunction(nullptr), "null pointer");
}
```
Naming recommendation:

> Test suites with death tests should be named ending with `DeathTest` to ensure proper sequencing and safety.

### Mocks and Expectations

GoogleTest integrates with GoogleMock to support mocks and expectations:

- **Mocks:** Objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.
- **Expectations:** Define which function calls are expected on mocks and their return values or side effects.
- **Matchers:** Verify arguments passed to mock functions.

This powerful combination enables detailed behavioral testing and isolation of units.

## Summary

Core concepts in GoogleTest revolve around clear terminology and structured workflows that help you write maintainable and scalable tests:

- Assertions verify the correctness of code behavior.
- Test fixtures share reusable setup among tests.
- Test suites organize related tests.
- Parameterized and typed tests maximize reuse across inputs and types.
- Death tests verify process termination behavior.
- Mocks and expectations allow interaction verification.

With this understanding, you can confidently design and implement comprehensive test suites using GoogleTest.
