# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Unlock the Language of GoogleTest

Welcome to the foundational guide that demystifies the essential concepts and terminology behind GoogleTest. Whether you are just starting with this powerful C++ testing framework or looking to deepen your understanding, this page equips you with the precise vocabulary you need to confidently navigate its documentation, write effective tests, and troubleshoot with clarity.

### Why This Matters

Understanding key terms such as **assertions**, **test suites**, **death tests**, **mocking**, **expectations**, **matchers**, and **parameterization** transforms how you work with GoogleTest. These concepts are the building blocks of test creation, execution, and verification — knowing them inside and out accelerates your productivity and test reliability.

## Core Vocabulary Explained

### Assertions: Verifying Conditions

At the heart of every GoogleTest test lies an *assertion*. Assertions are statements that check whether a condition in your code holds true. When an assertion passes, your test moves on silently. If it fails, GoogleTest provides a descriptive message pinpointing the exact issue.

- **ASSERT_***: Fatal assertions that stop the current test function immediately on failure.
- **EXPECT_***: Non-fatal assertions that log the failure but allow the test to continue.

**Example:**

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y must be of equal length";
EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(x)) << "x should be valid";
```

Consider `ASSERT_*` when continuing after failure would be pointless or dangerous, like dereferencing a null pointer. Use `EXPECT_*` when you want to see all issues in one run.

### Tests and Test Suites: Organization and Scope

- A **Test** is an individual, atomic verification of a function or method, defined with the `TEST()` macro.
- A **Test Suite** (previously called Test Case) groups related tests under a shared context, often representing a class or a module.

Tests within the same suite share naming conventions and can optionally share resources using **test fixtures**.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Here, both tests belong to the `FactorialTest` suite, making it easier to run and analyze tests for that component.

### Death Tests: Ensuring Safe Failures

Certain tests verify that a block of code causes the program to exit or abort as expected (e.g., enforcing invariants). These are called **death tests**.

- Use `ASSERT_DEATH()` or `EXPECT_DEATH()` macros.
- They check for process termination and error messages.

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, TerminatesOnNullInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(MyFunction(nullptr), "Null pointer detected");
}
```

Death tests are crucial for validating error handling and guarding against unrecoverable states.

### Mocking and Expectations: Simulating Dependencies

GoogleTest seamlessly integrates with GoogleMock for creating **mock objects**, which simulate real components your code depends on.

- **Mock Objects**: Used to isolate the code under test from its dependencies.
- **Expectations**: Set behaviors or call expectations on mock methods, defining which calls are allowed or required and their order.

This enables precise behavioral testing without requiring full implementations of external modules.

### Matchers: Expressive Assertions

Matchers describe expected conditions in a readable and flexible way, making your assertions clear and maintainable.

Example matcher usages:

- `EXPECT_THAT(str, StartsWith("Hello"));`
- `EXPECT_THAT(numbers, Contains(5));`

This approach aligns assertions to English-like expressions for conditions, improving diagnostics when failures occur.

### Parameterization: Testing with Diverse Inputs

GoogleTest supports running the same tests repeatedly with varying inputs or types:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests** (`TEST_P`): Different input values are fed to the same test logic.
- **Typed Tests** (`TYPED_TEST`): The same tests are run against a set of types.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests** (`TYPED_TEST_P`): Similar to typed tests but types can be specified separately.

This enables data-driven testing and comprehensive coverage with minimal code duplication.

## How Key Concepts Fit Together

To illustrate, imagine testing a sorting algorithm:

1. **Test Suites** group various test scenarios, e.g., `SortTest`.
2. Inside the suite, **Tests** check sorting of empty lists, single elements, or large arrays.
3. You use **Assertions** like `EXPECT_EQ` to validate order correctness.
4. **Parameterization** helps run the same checks for various input sizes or data types.
5. **Matchers** let you express conditions elegantly, e.g., `EXPECT_THAT(result, ::testing::Sorted());`.
6. You might build **Mock Objects** if your sort interacts with external sources.
7. In case your sort must abort on invalid input, **Death Tests** verify this behavior.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Favor `EXPECT_*` assertions in most cases to see all failures per test run.
- Use `ASSERT_*` only when continuing makes no sense (e.g., dereferencing pointers).
- Organize tests logically into suites reflecting code structure.
- Use **test fixtures** (`TEST_F`) to share setup/teardown code and common data.
- Use parameterized tests to avoid code duplication when testing multiple inputs or types.
- Always name your death test suites ending with `DeathTest` for clarity.
- When testing private code, consider using `FRIEND_TEST` macros or better yet, test via the public interface.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Mixing the terms *test* and *test suite* without clarity can cause confusion.
- Forgetting that `ASSERT_*` aborts the current function, which might skip cleanup.
- Using `ASSERT_*` in constructors or destructors is disallowed; use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` instead.
- Not instantiating parameterized tests causing no tests to run.
