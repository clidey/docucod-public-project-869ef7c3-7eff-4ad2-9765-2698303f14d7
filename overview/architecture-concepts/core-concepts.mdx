# Core Concepts and Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide for mastering GoogleTest’s essential concepts and terminology. This page unpacks pivotal terms such as test suites, test cases, assertions, matchers, mocks, actions, parameterized tests, and typed tests. You will also understand how GoogleTest and GoogleMock relate, and how standard testing patterns are implemented within the framework.

## Understanding the Basics: Key Terminology

At its core, GoogleTest enables you to write and organize C++ tests that are independent, repeatable, and informative. Before diving into writing tests, it is critical to comprehend the exact meaning of terms used throughout the framework to avoid confusion and maximize your testing efficiency.

| Meaning                                                                                 | GoogleTest Term           | Industry Standard (ISTQB) Term      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Exercise a particular program path with specific input values and verify results        | **Test** (formerly Test Case) | Test Case                          |
| Group tests logically by behavior or feature sharing common data or setup                | **Test Suite** (formerly Test Case) | Test Suite                        |

> **Note:** GoogleTest has transitioned from using the term *Test Case* to *Test Suite* to align better with industry standards (ISTQB). The preferred API now uses **TestSuite**.


## What Is a Test in GoogleTest?

A **test** exercises a specific part of your program using defined inputs and checks for expected behavior using *assertions*. Depending on the results of these assertions, a test can:

- **Succeed:** if all assertions pass
- **Fail nonfatally:** if some assertions fail, but test continues
- **Fail fatally:** if a critical assertion fails, aborting the test

Tests are independent functions, designed to run in isolation to avoid side-effects and enable easier debugging.

## Test Suites and Fixtures

**Test Suites** are collections of related tests that logically group functionality. They help organize tests mirroring your code’s structure, improving maintenance and readability.

When multiple tests within a test suite require shared data or setup, you define a **Test Fixture** by subclassing `testing::Test`:

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare shared resources
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up resources
  }

  // Shared data members for tests
  SomeClass shared_object_;
};
```

Tests using this fixture access the shared context via `TEST_F`:

```cpp
TEST_F(MyTestFixture, TestName) {
  // Test code accessing shared_object_
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_object_.IsReady());
}
```

Each test gets a fresh fixture instance to maintain independence.

## Assertions: Verifying Expected Behavior

Assertions are the building blocks of tests and verify conditions about your code. GoogleTest provides two families of assertion macros:

- **`EXPECT_*` macros:** Generate *nonfatal* failures. The test continues execution so multiple problems can be detected in one pass.
- **`ASSERT_*` macros:** Generate *fatal* failures, aborting the current test immediately.

Example with value equality assertions:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Custom failure message";
ASSERT_NE(pointer, nullptr) << "Pointer should not be null";
```

You can stream any C++ expression into assertions with `<<` for richer failure diagnostics.

All assertions report the failure location (file and line number) along with a detailed message.

---

## Matchers: Powerful Conditions for Assertions

GoogleTest uses **matchers** to express detailed conditions in your assertions, going beyond simple equality or Boolean checks.

For example, `EXPECT_THAT` combines a value with a matcher to verify complex properties:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(my_string, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(value, AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10)));
```

Matchers come from GoogleMock and enable expressive tests including regular expressions, container contents, or custom predicates.

---

## GoogleMock and Mocks

**GoogleMock** integrates seamlessly with GoogleTest to facilitate mocking—creating simulated objects with controlled behaviors.

- **Mocks** are classes where specific methods are overridden with mock implementations.
- **Expectations** define which methods are called, with what arguments, and how often.
- **Actions** describe what happens when these mocked methods are invoked.

Example of defining a mock method and expectation:

```cpp
class MockLogger {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Log, (const std::string& message), ());
};

MockLogger mock_logger;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_logger, Log("Start"))
    .Times(1);
```

Mocks improve testing of code with external dependencies by isolating behavior.

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

### Parameterized Tests

Parameterize tests to run the same test logic with different input values, avoiding duplication.

- Define a fixture subclassing `testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
- Use `TEST_P` macros to define parameterized test logic.
- Instantiate test variations with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` providing parameter sets.

Example:

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyParamTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

### Typed Tests

Typed tests let you verify the same behavior across multiple types:

- Define a fixture as a class template parameterized on a type.
- Associate a list of types using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.
- Define tests with `TYPED_TEST` macros using the specific type parameter.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, float>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, IsDefaultConstructible) {
  EXPECT_NO_THROW(TypeParam{});
}
```

These advanced test types increase code reuse and maintainability.

## Putting It Together: How GoogleTest and GoogleMock Interact

GoogleTest focuses on test execution, assertions, and test suite organization. GoogleMock extends this with mock object creation and flexible matching and action controls.

Together, they provide a comprehensive C++ testing and mocking framework enabling robust unit tests, integration tests, and behavior-driven development patterns.

---

## Tips and Common Pitfalls

- Always group logically related tests into test suites to reflect code structure.
- Use `EXPECT_*` assertions to find as many errors as possible per run; use `ASSERT_*` sparingly when continuation doesn't make sense.
- Name tests and test suites carefully, avoiding underscores as per recommended naming conventions.
- Utilize `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context for failures occurring deep within test helpers or loops.
- Keep tests independent to avoid flaky behavior.
- Use parameterized and typed tests to scale coverage efficiently.
- When mocking, define expectations clearly and use matchers to verify interactions precisely.

## Next Steps

Begin your testing journey by writing simple tests using the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md). Explore writing and organizing tests, using assertions effectively, and then progressively incorporate advanced concepts like parameterized and typed tests as your confidence grows.

Explore related documentation to deepen your understanding:
