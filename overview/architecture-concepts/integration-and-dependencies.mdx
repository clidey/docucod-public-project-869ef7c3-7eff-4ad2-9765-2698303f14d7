# Integration and Extensibility

GoogleTest's Integration and Extensibility page opens a direct window into how GoogleTest and GoogleMock effortlessly plug into your development workflows, build pipelines, and external tooling. Here, you’ll discover the practical paths for embedding GoogleTest into popular build systems, enriching your continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) setups, and enhancing your tests with powerful extensions.

## Unlocking Seamless Build System Integration

Integrating GoogleTest with your build system is the foundation for smooth automated testing. This page guides you through configuring GoogleTest with leading build systems like CMake and Bazel — the tools many modern C++ projects rely on.

### Why Integrate GoogleTest with Build Systems?

- **Automate Test Compilation:** Automatically compile test binaries with optimized flags and dependencies.
- **Manage Dependencies Easily:** GoogleTest’s planned dependencies, such as the Abseil library, are managed seamlessly through the build tools.
- **Enable Incremental Builds:** Efficiently rebuild only what’s changed, boosting your productivity.

### How It Works

- **CMake Integration:** GoogleTest provides official CMake support with targets that you can link against your test executables without hassle.
- **Bazel Support:** Bazel users benefit from preconfigured build rules that streamline adding GoogleTest to your workspace.
- **Planned Abseil Dependency:** To strengthen the internal robustness and compatibility, GoogleTest plans to depend on the Abseil library, a collection of foundational C++ libraries by Google.

> **Tip:** For exact steps and example configurations, see the installation and setup pages linked below.

## Elevating Your CI/CD Pipeline with GoogleTest

GoogleTest’s design helps you inject reliable testing into your CI/CD pipelines, enabling early detection of issues, faster feedback, and higher confidence in your code.

### Key Benefits:

- **Test Automation:** Run your test suites automatically on every code change or schedule.
- **Rich Reporting:** Supports detailed test output compatible with popular CI tools.
- **Leak Detection and Warnings:** Offers flags like `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks` and verbosity controls to tailor output for actionable insights.

### Getting Started with CI Systems

- Configure your build tool to compile GoogleTest alongside your code.
- Use the main test binary (available via the `gmock_main` target) to kick off all tests.
- Leverage GoogleTest and GoogleMock command-line flags to control verbosity and leak detection for CI-friendly output.

> **Best Practice:** Control verbosity via `--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error` to balance detailed reporting and noise.

## Extending GoogleMock for Maximum Flexibility

Test needs evolve — GoogleMock anticipates this with extensibility to tailor assertions, mock behaviors, and reporting.

### Planned Extension Points:

- **Custom Assertions:** Define your own expressive matchers that fit your domain, enriching test accuracy.
- **Custom Reporting:** Integrate with external logging and test reporting frameworks for seamless diagnostics.
- **Advanced Mocking Behaviors:** Extend GoogleMock’s mock method behaviors with custom actions, allowing complex test scenarios.

### How Users Benefit:

- Implement domain-specific checks right inside your mocks.
- Integrate effortlessly with third-party test dashboards or coverage reports.
- Flexibly control mock outcomes with lambda actions or hand-crafted behaviors.

> **Example:** You can create a matcher that verifies a complex data structure or state and use it in `EXPECT_CALL` to enforce sophisticated expectations.

## Summary

This page demystifies how GoogleTest and GoogleMock blend into your existing build ecosystem, empower your CI/CD workflows, and extend to fit your exact testing requirements. Whether you’re optimizing builds with CMake or Bazel, automating tests in continuous integration, or customizing mock behaviors with advanced assertions and reporting, this integration and extensibility guide is your launchpad.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Integration Challenges">
<Accordion title="Build System Issues">
If your build system doesn't find GoogleTest or GoogleMock headers, verify that your include paths are correctly set, and the targets (e.g., `gmock_main`) are linked properly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CI Output Too Verbose or Missing Info">
Adjust the flag `--gmock_verbose` to control detail level in output. Default is `warning`. Use `info` to get detailed traces or `error` to mute warnings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Extending with Custom Matchers Fails to Compile">
Ensure you define your matchers using the recommended macros or interfaces, and that you include `gmock/gmock.h` in your test files.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Remember, GoogleTest’s extensibility and integrations are actively evolving. Stay updated with the latest releases and documentation to utilize planned dependencies like Abseil and new extension points fully.

## Example: Integrating GoogleTest with CMake

```cmake
# Find GoogleTest package
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

# Add your test executable
add_executable(my_tests tests/my_tests.cc)

# Link against GoogleTest and pthread
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gtest_main pthread)

# Enable testing
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

Running `ctest` will now discover and run your GoogleTest-based tests.

## Example: Setting Default Mock Action in Test Setup

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::_;  // wildcard matcher

class MyMock : public SomeInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Compute, (int x), (override));
};

TEST(MyTestSuite, UsesDefaultActions) {
  MyMock mock;
  ON_CALL(mock, Compute(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(10)); // Expect call

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(10), 42);  // Uses expectation
  EXPECT_EQ(mock.Compute(20), 42);  // Uses default action
}
```

This example demonstrates setting up default behavior and specific expectations.
