# Core Concepts & Terminology

Gain a solid grasp of the essential vocabulary that will empower you to read, write, and discuss GoogleTest and GoogleMock code with clarity. This page introduces and defines key terms you'll encounter when working with GoogleMock, including assertions, fixtures, parameterized tests, death tests, mocking techniques, cardinalities, actions, and matchers.

## Why Understanding These Terms Matters

Imagine you're about to write your first unit test using GoogleTest and want to mock a class's behavior. You might ask yourself: What exactly is a mock? How can I specify which method calls to expect? What happens when a call is made with certain arguments? What do all those clauses like `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, or `.RetiresOnSaturation()` mean? Understanding the core concepts and vocabulary is the first step towards effectively leveraging GoogleMock's power.

This page builds the foundation, painting a clear picture of the terms professionals routinely use. Master these and you'll accelerate your learning curve, communicate effectively with teammates, and write more precise and maintainable tests.

## Key Terms and Their Definitions

### Assertion
An **assertion** is a statement in a test that verifies a condition. In GoogleTest, assertions check that the code behaves as expected. If the assertion fails, the test fails. For example, `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)` asserts that `expected` equals `actual`.

### Fixture
A **test fixture** sets up the environment needed for a group of tests. It allows shared setup and teardown for multiple tests to avoid duplication. For instance, if several tests need the same mock object or certain initialized state, you define a fixture class inheriting from `testing::Test`.

### Parameterized Tests
Tests that run multiple times with different input values. This helps to check a variety of cases efficiently. GoogleTest supports parameterized tests using its `TEST_P` macro and associated infrastructure.

### Death Tests
Special tests that verify your code terminates (e.g., crashes or exits) under expected error conditions. Useful for verifying that invalid inputs lead to failures, not undefined behavior.

### Mocking
**Mocking** involves creating mock objects that mimic the behavior of real objects but allow you to specify expectations and behaviors for method calls. It enables testing code interactions without relying on real implementations. In GoogleMock, mock classes are typically generated using `MOCK_METHOD()` macros.

### Cardinality
**Cardinality** defines how many times a mocked method is expected to be called during a test. GoogleMock offers built-in cardinalities such as:
- `Exactly(n)` - expect exactly n calls
- `AtLeast(n)` - expect at least n calls
- `AtMost(n)` - expect at most n calls
- `Between(m, n)` - expect between m and n calls
- `AnyNumber()` - zero or more calls

### Actions
**Actions** specify what a mock method does when called. For example, returning a value, invoking a callback, or changing an output parameter. Typical actions include:
- `Return(value)` — return a specified value
- `ReturnRef(variable)` — return a reference
- `Invoke(callable)` — call a function or lambda
- `SetArgPointee<N>(value)` — set the N-th argument pointed-to value
Actions are specified in clauses like `.WillOnce(action)` or `.WillRepeatedly(action)` on expectations.

### Matchers
**Matchers** define criteria that method arguments are expected to satisfy. They allow expressive checks beyond simple equality. For example:
- `_` matches any value (wildcard)
- `Eq(val)` matches arguments equal to `val`
- `Ge(n)` matches arguments greater than or equal to `n`
- Composite matchers like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, or custom predicate matchers provide rich expressiveness.

## How These Terms Interconnect in GoogleMock Usage

When you define a **mock class** using `MOCK_METHOD()`, you describe methods you intend to mock. In your tests, you specify **expectations** on these methods with `EXPECT_CALL()`, setting **cardinality** to express how many times calls should occur, **matchers** to specify argument constraints, and **actions** to define what happens when those calls occur. Multiple expectations can be sequenced or ordered using constructs like `InSequence` and dependency control like `After()`.

For example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::AtLeast;

MockTurtle turtle;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100))  // Matcher: exact value 100
    .Times(AtLeast(1))             // Cardinality: at least once
    .WillOnce(Return());            // Action: do nothing (void method)
```

This states that the `Forward` method is expected to be called at least once with the argument `100`. When called, it performs no special action as it returns void.

## Practical Tips and Guidance

- **Use mock objects to isolate your tests** by simulating dependencies. This makes tests faster, more reliable, and focused on the component under test.

- **Specify only the expectations that matter.** Avoid over-specifying your mocks, which can make tests brittle and hard to maintain.

- **Use `ON_CALL()` to define default behaviors without setting strict expectations,** allowing calls to go through with default returns.

- **Control call order explicitly** with `InSequence` or `After` to avoid brittle tests that break due to unexpected call order.

- **Retire expectations using `.RetiresOnSaturation()`** to prevent “sticky” expectations that continue matching calls after their cardinality is reached.

- **Combine matchers and actions** to simulate complex behaviors, validate arguments, and control test flow.

- **Remember the difference between uninteresting and unexpected calls:** Uninteresting calls have no expectation set and result in warnings by default; unexpected calls violate existing expectations and always cause errors.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Not overriding **virtual** methods in mock classes will cause the real methods to be called during tests instead of the mocks.

- Misplacing `MOCK_METHOD` definitions outside the `public` section disables `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` from accessing the mocks.

- Forgetting to specify **cardinalities** or relying on inferred cardinalities without being explicit can lead to confusing test failures.

- Excessively strict expectations on call order can make tests brittle.

- Returning references without using `ReturnRef()` will cause compilation or runtime errors.

- Ignoring warnings about uninteresting calls might hide potentially incorrect test behavior.
