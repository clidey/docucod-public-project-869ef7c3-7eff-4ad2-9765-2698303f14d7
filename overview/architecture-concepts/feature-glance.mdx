## Why This Matters

Writing reliable, maintainable C++ tests requires a powerful yet easy-to-use framework. GoogleTest enables streamlined test creation with rich assertions and seamless test discovery, while GoogleMock elevates design quality through comprehensive mocking capabilities. This overview helps you identify the tools and features most relevant to your project, accelerating your adoption and improving test effectiveness.

## Major Feature Areas

| Feature Category             | Description & Benefits                                                                                                   | Example Use Case                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Assertions**              | Provide expressive, informative checks to verify that tested code behaves as expected. Supports fatal and non-fatal failures.| Verify function output with detailed failure messages. |
| **Matchers**                | Enable flexible argument validation in tests and mocks using a rich collection of matchers (equality, relational, regex).  | Assert argument conditions in mocking expectations.   |
| **Mocking Capabilities**    | Create mock classes and methods with declarative syntax, set call expectations, specify behaviors, and verify calls automatically.| Test complex interactions by simulating dependencies.  |
| **Test Discovery**          | Automatically registers and runs tests, avoiding manual listing or maintenance.                                         | Add tests incrementally without changing the test runner.
|
| **Parameterized Testing**  | Supports value-parameterized and type-parameterized tests for running the same test logic with multiple inputs or data types.| Test functions with multiple input combinations systematically.|  
| **Cross-platform Support** | Compatible with Linux, Windows, and Mac OS, supporting diverse compilers and build tools like CMake and Bazel.             | Develop and test on multiple operating systems easily. |
| **Test Output & Reporting** | Generates detailed console output and XML reports for CI systems, with customizable test filters and colors.             | Integrate with continuous integration pipelines.       |

## Feature Highlights

### Assertions
- Rich macros such as `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, with detailed failure diagnostics.
- Supports fatal assertions (abort test on failure) and non-fatal assertions (continue running).
- User-defined custom assertions are possible.

### Matchers
- Built-in matchers include equality, inequality, comparison operators, and regex string matchers.
- Combine matchers for complex argument validation in mocks.
- Supports wildcards and multi-argument matchers.

### Mocking (GoogleMock)
- `MOCK_METHOD` macro to declare mock methods.
- Set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` for invocation counts, order, and argument constraints.
- Specify method behaviors with `WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly` actions.
- Supports strictness modes: `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`.

### Test Discovery
- No need to list tests; GoogleTest automatically registers each `TEST` and `TEST_F`.
- Filter tests by name and selectively run subsets.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests
- Use `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for value-driven test variants.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` for type-parameterized testing.
- Enable reusable, scalable test code across inputs and types.

### Cross-platform Compatibility
- Works reliably on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X.
- Built-in support for major compilers and IDEs.
- Integrates with CMake and Bazel build systems.

### Test Output
- Clear, well-formatted console output with color support.
- XML reports compatible with CI systems.
- Customizable through listeners and filters.

## Practical Example: Using Assertions and Mocks

```cpp
// A simple test with GoogleTest.
TEST(MathTest, SimpleAddition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

// A mock class declaration.
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), ());
};

// Using a mock in a test.
TEST(DatabaseTest, ConnectsSuccessfully) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("localhost"))
      .WillOnce(testing::Return(true));

  EXPECT_TRUE(mock_db.Connect("localhost"));
}
```

## Tips for Success

- Name your test suites and tests clearly without underscores to avoid clashes.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions except when failure should abort test.
- Leverage parameterized tests to cover multiple input scenarios efficiently.
- Use GoogleMock to isolate units by mocking dependencies and verifying interactions.
- Integrate output reports with your CI pipelines for automated quality checks.

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="Build and Integration Errors">
Make sure your build environment supports C++17, as GoogleTest requires it. Use provided CMake integration or follow build instructions accurately to avoid linker issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Assertion Failures">
Check your test logic and assertions carefully. Use GoogleTest's detailed failure messages and scoped traces (`SCOPED_TRACE`) to pinpoint causes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mocking Unexpected Behavior">
Ensure `EXPECT_CALL` precedes code exercising the mock. Set appropriate cardinalities and behaviors to avoid spurious failures or untriggered calls.
