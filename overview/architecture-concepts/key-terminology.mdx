# Key Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational page where you will get familiar with GoogleTest's essential terms. Understanding these concepts—test cases, assertions, expectations, mocks, death tests, parameterized and typed tests—is critical to navigating, writing, and interpreting GoogleTest documentation and code effectively.

---

## Why This Matters

Imagine you are gearing up to write effective tests or mock classes. Without a shared language, it's easy to get lost in the nuances and mechanics of the framework. This page acts as your compass, clarifying the terminology so you can:  

- **Communicate clearly** about tests and expectations  
- **Understand test results and errors** with confidence  
- **Leverage advanced features** like mocks and parameterized tests  

Whether you’re new to GoogleTest or aiming to elevate your testing strategy, mastering these core concepts is your first step.

## Key Terms Explained

### Test Cases
A **test case** groups together related tests. It represents the logical suite under which one or more individual test functions execute. Each test case is typically named after the feature or component being tested.

### Assertions
Assertions are the **checks** within tests that verify whether the observed outcome matches the expected result. GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertions ranging from simple equality checks (`EXPECT_EQ`) to complex condition matches, helping ensure your code behaves as designed.

### Expectations
While assertions validate outcomes, **expectations** specify how mocked objects should be used.
Expectations define:
  - What methods will be called on a mock
  - With which arguments
  - How many times
  - In what order (optional)

Setting correct expectations ensures your mocks precisely model the interaction your code under test should have with its dependencies.

### Mocks
Mocks are **test doubles** that simulate real objects' behavior for testing purposes. They allow you to verify interactions without depending on actual implementations or external systems.

GoogleMock, integrated with GoogleTest, offers powerful mocking features enabling:
  - Mock class creation through simple macros
  - Defining default behaviors and expectations
  - Verifying that all defined expectations are met automatically upon object destruction

### Death Tests
A **death test** checks that your program terminates (dies) as expected in certain scenarios (e.g., invalid inputs). This is essential for testing robust error handling and fail-safe behaviors.

### Parameterized Tests & Typed Tests
**Parameterized tests** let you run the same test logic across multiple inputs efficiently, enhancing coverage without code duplication.

**Typed tests** extend this model by running tests for multiple types, supporting generic programming verification.

Both features are vital for scalable, maintainable test suites.

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- When defining **mock methods**, always ensure functions are `virtual` for them to be mockable, or use the special high-performance dependency injection approach described in the docs.
- Use `_` matcher liberally in expectations to specify flexibility in arguments.
- Avoid over-specifying expectations; prefer setting only those necessary to verify the contract.
- For **uninteresting calls** (methods without set expectations), GoogleMock may emit warnings by default—consider using `NiceMock` to suppress these or set catch-all expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- When writing **parameterized tests**, start simple. Define your tests without parameters first, then add parameterization to gain greater coverage.

## Example: Simple Mock and Expectation

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual std::string Describe(const char* name) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Describe, (const char* name), (override));
};

TEST(SimpleTest, UsesMock) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetSize())
      .Times(1)
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(42, mock.GetSize());
}
```

This snippet illustrates basic mocking:
- You define an interface with virtual methods.
- Mock class inherits and uses `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Set expectations on mock method calls.
- Exercise the code and verify the behavior.
