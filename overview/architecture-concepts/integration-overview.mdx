# Integration and Extensibility

Enhance your testing workflows by extending and integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock with your development environment, CI/CD pipelines, and custom tooling. This page guides you through common extension scenarios such as connecting with continuous integration platforms, interoperating with complementary open-source projects, embedding GoogleTest within your existing codebases, and creating custom plugins and runners to streamline reporting and execution.

---

## Why Extend and Integrate?

Your testing framework should work seamlessly within your development lifecycle rather than in isolation. Integration and extensibility empower you to:

- Automate tests as part of your CI/CD process for rapid feedback.
- Combine GoogleTest and GoogleMock with other open-source tools and custom utilities.
- Embed test execution directly into your codebase or build systems.
- Extend test runners and reporters to meet project-specific needs.

These capabilities ensure that your tests stay relevant, actionable, and easily maintainable.

## Common Integration Scenarios

### Connecting with CI/CD Platforms

GoogleTest is designed to fit effortlessly into automated build and integration pipelines:

- **Standard Exit Codes:** The `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` macro returns a status indicating success or failure, enabling CI tools to detect test outcomes programmatically.
- **XML/JSON Reporting:** Generate machine-readable test result reports with flags like `--gtest_output=xml:path` or `--gtest_output=json:path`. These reports can be consumed by CI dashboards or test aggregators for detailed analysis.
- **Filtering Tests:** Use `--gtest_filter` to select specific test suites or cases during pipeline runs for targeted testing.
- **Sharding:** Distribute tests across multiple agents using the `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` environment variables for parallel execution and faster feedback.

**Practical Example:**

```bash
# Run all tests and generate XML report
./my_test --gtest_output=xml:build/test_report.xml

# Run only FooTest suite on the first shard in a 3-shard distributed job
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=3 GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 ./my_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.*
```

### Interoperating with Other Open-Source Projects

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are often integrated alongside complementary testing tools:

- Use **mocking matchers** from GoogleMock seamlessly in GoogleTest assertions (`EXPECT_THAT`).
- Embed GoogleTest suites inside larger test harnesses or system tests that aggregate results from multiple frameworks.
- Combine with code coverage tools, static analyzers, or profiling utilities by generating compatible outputs.

**Tip:** Ensure proper initialization order by invoking `testing::InitGoogleTest()` or `testing::InitGoogleMock()` early in your test entry point.

### Embedding in User Codebases

You can embed GoogleTest directly into your projects' codebases to provide rich testing capabilities:

- Link against the bundled or installed GoogleTest libraries (`gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, `gmock_main`).
- Include headers and invoke tests from your custom test runners or build rules.
- Customize `main()` functions as needed to integrate with your application startup logic.

For example, when linking with CMake, find and use the provided configuration files to integrate GoogleTest:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test GTest::gtest_main)
```

### Plugin Development: Custom Runners and Reporters

GoogleTest's event listener API enables you to build custom test runners, reporters, or integrate specialized logging and metrics:

- Subclass `testing::TestEventListener` or `testing::EmptyTestEventListener` to receive callbacks about test start/finish, assertions, and results.
- Append your listeners to the event dispatcher to replace or augment default console or XML output.

```c++
class CustomListener : public testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting: " << test_info.test_suite_name() << "." << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished: " << test_info.test_suite_name() << "." << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  auto& listeners = testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
  delete listeners.Release(listeners.default_result_printer());  // Remove default printer
  listeners.Append(new CustomListener());
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This architecture lets you tailor reports for integration with proprietary dashboards, advanced metrics, or team-specific tooling.

## Best Practices for Extensibility and Integration

- **Initialize Properly:** Always call `InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()` with command-line arguments to enable flag parsing and integration.
- **Use Standard Exit Codes:** Return the status from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` function to ensure external tools detect pass/fail results correctly.
- **Leverage Built-in Reporting:** Employ the XML or JSON output flags for automated report ingestion.
- **Avoid Ignoring Return Values:** Ignoring `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return value can cause severe inaccuracies in CI feedback.
- **Register Event Listeners Early:** Add custom event listeners before invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` for consistent behavior.
- **Adhere to Naming Conventions:** Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent conflicts and ensure compatibility.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Integration and Extensibility Troubleshooting">
<Accordion title="Test Results Not Reported Correctly in CI">
Verify that your test executable returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in `main()`. Many CI platforms rely on the test process exit code to determine pass/fail.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom Event Listener Output Overlapping Default Printer">
If you use a custom listener and notice mixed console output, release and delete the default result printer before appending your listener.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running When Using Filters or Sharding">
Ensure that `--gtest_filter` patterns are accurate and that sharding environment variables are set correctly. Use `--gtest_list_tests` to verify available tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Difficulty Integrating GoogleTest into Custom Build Systems">
Use CMake's `find_package` for GoogleTest or include its source via `add_subdirectory()` to simplify integration and ensure consistent compiler settings.
</Accordion>

## Getting Started Preview

To begin extending or integrating GoogleTest:

1. **Initialize Testing Framework:** Use `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` in your main.
2. **Automate Execution:** Call and return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` result.
3. **Enable Reporting:** Add `--gtest_output=xml:<path>` flags or configure environment variables for CI integration.
4. **Customize Listeners:** Create and register custom event listeners for advanced reporting.
