# Core Concepts and Terminology

GoogleTest is a powerful C++ testing framework built to make writing, organizing, and running tests simple and effective. This page demystifies the essential language and foundational concepts you’ll encounter as you use GoogleTest, explaining them in plain language and connecting them to practical testing scenarios.

Understanding these terms will help you navigate the framework, write better tests, and leverage GoogleTest’s advanced features with confidence.

## Test Suites and Test Cases

### What is a Test Suite?

A **test suite** is a named collection of related tests. Think of it as a logical grouping of tests that check different aspects of the same component or feature in your code. Grouping tests this way helps you organize your tests for clarity and reuse shared setup or teardown logic.

### What is a Test Case?

The term *test case* in GoogleTest refers to an individual test within a test suite, commonly just called a **test**. Each test case is an independent unit that fully exercises a specific behavior or condition in the code.

#### Note on Terminology:

While historically GoogleTest used the term *Test Case* to mean what is now called *Test Suite*, current GoogleTest documentation and API prefer **Test Suite** as the grouping concept.

### Practical Example

```cpp
// Defines a test suite named MathFunctions
// with two test cases: HandlesZeroInput and HandlesPositiveInput.
TEST(MathFunctions, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(MathFunctions, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}
```

Here, `MathFunctions` is the test suite, and `HandlesZeroInput` and `HandlesPositiveInput` are individual test cases.

## Test Fixtures

### What Is a Test Fixture?

A **test fixture** is a C++ class derived from `testing::Test` that serves as a shared context to run multiple related tests. It encapsulates common data setup and teardown so that each test can execute in a controlled, fresh environment without duplicating code.

### Why Use Test Fixtures?

- **Reuse Setup/Teardown**: Initialize expensive or common resources once per test.
- **Isolate Tests**: Each test runs on its own fixture object, preventing side effects between tests.
- **Organize Code**: Group logically related tests and data.

### Writing a Test Fixture

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Prepare queues used in multiple tests.
    q0_.Clear();
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Called before each test if additional setup needed.
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Called after each test if needed.
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  auto elem = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(elem, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*elem, 1);
}
```

Notice the use of `TEST_F` instead of `TEST`. This macro indicates the test uses the fixture class.

---

## Assertions

Assertions are the building blocks of test verification in GoogleTest. They allow you to check whether the program behaves as expected.

- **Fatal assertions** (`ASSERT_*`) abort the current test if they fail.
- **Non-fatal assertions** (`EXPECT_*`) report the failure but let the test continue.

You should choose fatal assertions for conditions where continuing makes no sense (e.g., null pointer checks).

Example:

```cpp
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer should not be null.";
EXPECT_EQ(value, 42) << "Value is not as expected.";
```


---

## Matchers and Mocks

### Matchers

Matchers specify criteria to compare actual values with expected ones. They provide expressive ways to verify complex conditions beyond simple equality.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(my_vector, ::testing::ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

### Mocks

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest by providing mock object support for use in unit testing. Mocks let you control, verify, and simulate interactions with dependencies.

---

## Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests let you run the same test logic over multiple inputs or types.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

Use value-parameterized tests when you want to test behavior with different values.

- Define a test fixture inheriting from `TestWithParam<T>`.
- Define tests using `TEST_P`.
- Instantiate tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

Example:

```cpp
class MyValueTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyValueTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyValueTest, testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```

### Typed Tests

Typed tests run the same test logic on a list of types.

- Define a fixture class template parameterized on a type.
- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` to associate types.
- Define tests using `TYPED_TEST`.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, IsZeroInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->value_, TypeParam{});
}
```

### Type-Parameterized Tests

Similar to typed tests, but more flexible and reusable across translation units.

- Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` to define abstract test suites.
- Instantiate them with `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

Example pattern:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyAbstractTypedTest : public testing::Test {};

TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyAbstractTypedTest);

TYPED_TEST_P(MyAbstractTypedTest, TestA) { ... }
TYPED_TEST_P(MyAbstractTypedTest, TestB) { ... }

REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyAbstractTypedTest, TestA, TestB);

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, char>;
INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P(MyPrefix, MyAbstractTypedTest, MyTypes);
```

---

## Death Tests

Death tests verify that code terminates or crashes under specific circumstances.

- Declared with `EXPECT_DEATH` or `ASSERT_DEATH`.
- Run in subprocesses to isolate failures.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(CallFatalFunction(), "expected error message");
```

---

## Summary

Here are the core concepts you now understand:

- **Test Suites** and **Test Cases (Tests)**: Grouping and individual tests
- **Test Fixtures**: Shared setup for multiple tests
- **Assertions**: Checking conditions with fatal and non-fatal failure modes
- **Matchers and Mocks**: Advanced value checking and test doubles
- **Parameterized and Typed Tests**: Running tests with varying data or types
- **Death Tests**: Verifying program crashes or process terminations

Mastering these concepts will empower you to write clear, maintainable, and robust tests using GoogleTest.

<Tip>
Need help using typed or type-parameterized tests? Review the example code showing fixture templates and test instantiations carefully, as these patterns form the basis of reusable, type-driven test logic.

<Tip>
Always ensure test suite and test names are free of underscores (`_`) to avoid internal naming conflicts—see the FAQ for detailed explanation.
