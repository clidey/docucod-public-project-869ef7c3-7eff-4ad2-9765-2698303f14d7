# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the foundational concepts and terminology of GoogleTest empowers you to write effective, maintainable, and robust tests. This page defines essential testing patterns—including xUnit architecture, assertions, fixtures, death tests, parameterized tests, matchers, and mocks—and connects each to how GoogleTest implements or extends these paradigms.

## The xUnit Architecture in GoogleTest

GoogleTest is built on the widely adopted xUnit testing framework architecture, which organizes tests into clear, repeatable units.

- **Test**: A single verification of behavior.
- **Test Suite (formerly Test Case)**: A group of related tests structured to share setup and teardown code.
- **Assertions**: Statements within tests that check conditions and determine test outcomes.

GoogleTest provides macros and structures that follow this model, enabling intuitive test creation and organization that scale with your project's complexity.

## Assertions: The Heart of Validation

Assertions are the mechanism you use to verify that your code behaves as expected. GoogleTest offers an expressive set of assertions:

- **EXPECT_***: Nonfatal assertions that allow tests to continue after failure, revealing multiple errors per test run.
- **ASSERT_***: Fatal assertions that abort the current test function when failed, helping prevent cascading failures.

Example usage illustrates their practical distinction:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(expected_value, actual_value) << "Failure message if they differ.";
EXPECT_TRUE(condition) << "Condition failed.";
```

Using assertions effectively ensures comprehensive, informative test runs and faster debugging.

## Fixtures: Reusing Setup and Teardown

Test fixtures let you define a common test environment and shared resources for multiple tests.

- Define a fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Controls setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) logic for tests.
- Use `TEST_F()` to write tests that run with this shared context.

This pattern reduces redundancy and ensures consistent initial conditions across related tests.

## Death Tests: Validating Failure Modes

Death tests verify that your code behaves correctly in failure scenarios by checking that it terminates as expected under certain conditions.

GoogleTest supports death tests that:

- Run the tested code in a subprocess or thread to isolate crashing behavior.
- Use macros like `EXPECT_DEATH()` and `ASSERT_DEATH()` to verify expected termination and optional matching error messages.

Death tests safeguard your software by ensuring failures happen safely and predictably.

## Value- and Type-Parameterized Tests: Broadening Test Coverage

To efficiently test code over a range of inputs or types, GoogleTest includes parameterized tests:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test logic repeatedly with different input values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests**: Run tests generically over multiple types, useful for templates.

GoogleTest provides interfaces for defining parameter sets and associating them with test cases, dramatically increasing test coverage with minimal code duplication.

## Matchers: Expressive Argument Validation

Matchers provide a powerful way to specify expectations on mock function arguments or assertion values.

- Built-in matchers include equality, inequality, comparison, and pattern matching.
- Composable to model complex argument conditions.
- Support multi-argument matching through tuple matchers.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(Ge(5), Lt(10)));
```

Matchers make your tests more readable and flexible by precisely describing the criteria under which functions are called.

## Mocks: Modeling and Controlling Dependencies

GoogleTest extends its core testing capabilities with GoogleMock to:

- Define **mock classes** and methods using `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Specify **expectations** on method calls, including call frequency and arguments.
- Define **actions** to execute when mock methods are called.

This facilitates isolated testing by simulating interactions with complex or external components, enabling robust test-driven development and behavior verification.

### Practical Summary:
GoogleTest provides a comprehensive, modular approach to automated testing centered around proven testing concepts:

- Leverage the xUnit test architecture to structure tests clearly.
- Use assertions to validate behavior precisely.
- Share setup and teardown with fixtures for maintainability.
- Leverage death tests to validate failure scenarios safely.
- Expand tests with parameterized methods for completeness.
- Harness matchers and mocks to describe and control interactions fluently.

This page lays the essential vocabulary and concepts foundational for exploring deeper guides and references.
