# Core Concepts and Terminology

Understanding the key concepts and terminology in GoogleTest is essential for effective usage and communication about your tests. This page provides clear definitions and explanations of the foundational elements that this framework uses to organize and execute tests, including test fixtures, assertions, matchers, test cases, and mocks.

---

## Test

A **test** is the fundamental unit in GoogleTest. It represents a function that exercises some aspect of your code and verifies the expected behavior through assertions.

- **Nature:** A test is defined as an ordinary C++ function, typically created using the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- **Execution:** When a test runs, it executes the code under test and checks assertions to determine success or failure.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

This test verifies that the factorial of 0 is 1.

## Test Suite / Test Case

A **test suite** (historically called *test case*) groups related tests that typically share a common setup or fixture.

- **Purpose:** Organizes tests logically, reflecting the structure of the code under test.
- **Naming:** The first parameter of `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` specifies the test suite name.
- **Grouping:** Tests within a suite can share common test fixtures for setup and teardown.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Together with the previous example, these two tests belong to the `FactorialTest` suite.

## Test Fixture

A **test fixture** is a class derived from `testing::Test` designed to hold common data and setup/teardown methods used by multiple tests.

- **Benefit:** Avoids code duplication and helps initialize objects shared by tests.
- **Lifecycle:** GoogleTest creates a new instance of the fixture for each test, calling `SetUp()` before and `TearDown()` after each test.
- **Usage:** Use `TEST_F()` macro instead of `TEST()` to write tests using a fixture.

**Steps to create a test fixture:**

1. Define a class inheriting from `testing::Test`.
2. Declare shared objects as members.
3. Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` to configure and clean up.

**Example:**
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

## Assertions

**Assertions** are statements that verify if a condition holds true during test execution. They serve as the checkpoints determining test success or failure.

- **Types:** 
  - `ASSERT_*` generates *fatal* failures and aborts the current test function.
  - `EXPECT_*` generates *non-fatal* failures and allows tests to continue.
  
- **Basic Usage:** 
  Use assertions for value comparisons, condition checks, string matching, exception checks, and more.

- **Custom Messages:** 
  You can stream custom messages to assertions to clarify failures.

**Example:**
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y have different lengths";
EXPECT_EQ(x[0], y[0]) << "Mismatch at index 0";
```

---

## Matchers

Matchers allow flexible specification of which argument values a mock method expects.

- **Purpose:** Specify how individual or multiple arguments are validated against expected values or properties.
- **Types:** Built-in matchers include `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `Ne()`, `HasSubstr()`, and many more.
- **Combining:** Matchers can be combined using `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, `Not()`, etc., to create complex matching logic.
- **Use in Mocks:** Provided as arguments to `EXPECT_CALL()` and `ON_CALL()` to specify expectations.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThis(Ge(5)));  // Argument must be >= 5
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThat(_, NotNull())); // First argument anything; second arg not null
```

For full details, see the [Matchers Reference](reference/matching.md).

## Mock Classes and Mock Methods

**Mocks** are objects that mimic the behavior of real classes and allow control over method calls for testing purposes.

- **Mock Classes:** Classes where methods are replaced with mocks, enabling verification and control over method invocations.
- **Defining Mocks:** Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to declare mock methods inside your mock class in `public` scope regardless of base class access control.
- **Expectations:** Set with `EXPECT_CALL` to specify how the mock method should behave and how often it should be called.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n), (override));
};

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5)).WillOnce(Return(10));
EXPECT_EQ(mock.Bar(5), 10);
```

---

## Test Program and Execution Flow

- Your test program contains multiple tests grouped into test suites (optionally using fixtures).
- After registering all tests (statically or dynamically), you call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to execute them.
- GoogleTest runs each test individually, reporting results and continuing despite failures unless fatal assertions occur.
- Test failures provide detailed information about assertion errors, mismatched expectations, and stack traces.

This execution model enables isolated, repeatable, and informative testing workflows.

## Common Terminology Summary

| Term           | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test           | A function that runs code and verifies behavior using assertions.   |
| Test Suite     | A group of related tests sharing common setup.                      |
| Test Fixture   | A class to share test setup and teardown logic among tests.        |
| Assertion      | A check in a test that determines pass/fail. 
| Matcher        | A predicate that checks if a mock method argument meets criteria.   |
| Mock           | An object with methods replaced to verify and simulate behavior.    |

## Practical Tips

- Use `TEST()` for simple, isolated tests.
- Use `TEST_F()` with fixtures when tests share setup or data.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` assertions to allow tests to report multiple failures.
- Use matchers in mocking to flexibly validate method arguments.
- Name test suites and tests clearly to reflect their purpose.
