# System Architecture Overview

## Understanding GoogleTest's Core Architecture

GoogleTest is designed to provide a robust, extensible, and streamlined C++ testing framework that automates the discovery, execution, and result reporting of tests. This page delves into the architectural components that make GoogleTest function seamlessly—from how tests are discovered to how assertion results are processed—while also highlighting the integration with GoogleMock.

This overview is essential for users who want to understand the internals that power their test runs, especially for advanced users aiming to extend GoogleTest or troubleshoot complex behaviors.

### Key Architectural Components

1. **Test Case Discovery**
   - GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests defined via macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()`.
   - Tests are organized into **Test Suites** (formerly called *Test Cases*), grouping logically related tests.
   - The discovery mechanism registers test fixtures and test bodies before execution, liberating users from manual enumeration.

2. **Test Runner**
   - Manages the lifecycle of test execution.
   - Instantiates fresh test fixture objects for every test, ensuring isolation and repeatability.
   - Handles per-test setup (`SetUp`) and teardown (`TearDown`), as well as test suite-wide setup (`SetUpTestSuite`) and teardown.
   - Supports advanced features like test filtering, sharding for distributed testing, and test order randomization.

3. **Assertion Engine**
   - Provides a rich set of assertion macros (e.g., `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`) that can produce fatal or nonfatal failures.
   - Internally manages detailed failure reporting including file locations, line numbers, and custom messages.
   - Asserts are recorded and aggregated per-test to determine the test outcome.

4. **Test Event Listeners**
   - Implements an event-listener model enabling users to hook into various points of the test lifecycle (e.g., test start, test failure).
   - Supports default built-in listeners for console and XML/JSON output.
   - Allows custom listeners for integrations with CI systems, GUIs, or alternative reporting.

5. **GoogleMock Interaction Layer**
   - GoogleMock is tightly integrated with GoogleTest.
   - Provides mocks that interplay with GoogleTest’s assertion and event system to verify expectations.
   - Enables declarative mock declarations and automatic verification upon test completion.
