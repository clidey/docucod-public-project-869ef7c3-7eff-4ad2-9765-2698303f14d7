# Feature Highlights

Discover the core capabilities that make GoogleTest and its mocking extension, GoogleMock, indispensable tools for C++ testing. This page quickly walks through flagship features such as assertions, mocking facilities, test discovery, parameterized tests, death tests, custom assertions, and flexible test execution options. These features empower you to write clear, robust tests that fit a broad range of workflows and testing needs.

---

## Why These Features Matter

In real-world development, writing quality tests that are easy to maintain, expressive, and performant can be challenging. GoogleTest addresses these challenges with a comprehensive feature set that helps you focus on verifying behavior, mocking dependencies, and managing complex scenarios with confidence. Whether you're a developer building new code or maintaining legacy systems, these features accelerate your feedback loop and enhance test reliability.

## Key Feature Highlights

### 1. Rich Assertions
GoogleTest provides a broad spectrum of assertions—from simple value comparisons to flexible predicate-based checks:
- **Basic Assertions** like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE` provide clear, concise validations.
- **Custom Assertions** allow writing expressive checks tailored to your domain.
- **Fatal vs Non-fatal Assertions** (`ASSERT_` vs `EXPECT_`) let you control test flow on failure.

_Example:_
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(calculated_value, expected_value) << "Calculation did not match expected result";
```

### 2. Mocking with GoogleMock
GoogleMock seamlessly integrates with GoogleTest to create mocks easily:
- Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to define mock functions overriding virtual methods.
- Set **expectations** about how mocks should be called using `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Define **default actions** for unexpected calls with `ON_CALL`.
- Support for **strictness modes** with `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` helps tailor verbosity and failure policies for uninteresting calls.

_Example:_
```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
};

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetSize()).WillOnce(Return(42));
```

### 3. Test Case Discovery
GoogleTest automatically detects all your tests without extra registration:
- It finds test cases and test methods defined by `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P` macros.
- Supports organizing tests into suites to logically group related tests.

This automatic discovery enables running targeted subsets of tests quickly.

### 4. Parameterized and Typed Tests
To reduce code duplication and empower test reusability:
- **Parameterized Tests** allow one test definition with multiple input sets.
- **Typed Tests** let you run the same tests on different types.

_Example for Parameterized Test:_
```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(n % 2 == 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, FooTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```

### 5. Death Tests
Test that your code terminates or throws exceptions as expected:
- Useful for validating assertions, fatal errors, or environment conditions.

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(Foo(-1), "\QInvalid input\E");
```

### 6. Flexible Test Execution Options
Run tests the way you want:
- Run all tests or filtered subsets by name, suite, or tags.
- Control order and repeat specific tests.
- Integrate smoothly into continuous integration pipelines.

### 7. Custom Assertions
Write domain-specific assertions that output descriptive failures:
- Create via macros like `ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT1` or functions.
- Improves readability and debuggability of complex verifications.

## Real-World Context: How These Features Solve Your Problems

Imagine you’re tasked with validating a critical library function that depends on external resources. Using GoogleMock, you mock the dependencies to simulate various behaviors (success, failures, exceptions). GoogleTest’s rich assertions help you verify outcomes precisely. Parameterized tests let you run multiple input scenarios without duplicating test code. Death tests validate that the code correctly handles invalid input by terminating early.

Before GoogleTest and GoogleMock, such testing required extensive boilerplate or fragile hand-written mocks. Now, your tests are concise, maintainable, and expressive, with clear failure messages when unexpected behavior occurs.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly:** Only set expectations you truly want to verify to avoid brittle tests.
- **Suppress noise with `NiceMock`:** Helps when underlying mocks are noisy but behavior is correct.
- **Leverage parameterized tests:** Avoid repetitive test code by combining inputs elegantly.
- **Combine `InSequence` and `After`:** To express the order of mock calls precisely.
- **Use custom matchers:** For readable and reusable argument verification.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Uninteresting calls warning:** You can suppress or escalate warnings using `NiceMock` or `StrictMock`.
- **Missed constructor visibility:** `MOCK_METHOD` macros must be in `public:` regardless of original visibility.
- **Mocking non-virtual methods:** Not supported directly, but see high-performance dependency injection patterns.
- **Ambiguous overloaded methods:** Use `using Base::Method` in mocks to avoid hidden overloads.
