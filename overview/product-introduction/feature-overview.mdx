# Feature Overview

## Unlock the Power of GoogleTest

GoogleTest is a feature-rich C++ testing framework that empowers developers to write robust, maintainable, and scalable tests with ease. This overview highlights core features that enable you to efficiently validate your code’s correctness, organize tests effectively, and extend testing capabilities to cover complex scenarios.

---

## Core Features at a Glance

- **xUnit-Style Architecture:** Write tests using familiar test suites and test cases, making it easy to adopt if you’ve worked with JUnit, PyUnit, or similar tools.
- **Automatic Test Discovery:** Simply write tests; GoogleTest handles the registration and discovery, eliminating manual test enumeration.
- **Rich Assertions:** Verify conditions using a broad set of assertion macros (`ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*`), including checks for equality, string matches, floating-point approximate comparisons, and user-defined predicates.
- **User-Defined Extensions:** Create custom assertions, matchers, and predicates to tailor checks to your project’s domain.
- **Parameterized and Typed Tests:** Reuse test logic across different data sets or type variations, reducing redundant code and broadening test coverage.
- **Death Tests:** Test expected program termination or fatal failures safely without full test suite disruption.
- **Flexible Test Runners:** Customize test execution, filter which tests to run, and configure test order.
- **Integration and Ecosystem:** Works seamlessly with build systems like CMake and Bazel, integrating into your existing workflows.

## Test Structure and Execution

GoogleTest follows a simple, yet powerful pattern inspired by the xUnit framework:

- Group related tests into **test suites**.
- Define individual **tests** using clear, descriptive names.
- Use assertions within tests to verify behavior.

Once tests are written, the framework automatically detects and runs them, reporting concise progress and detailed failure information.

### Writing Tests: Simple Example

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Tests are organized under the `FactorialTest` suite, providing clear logical grouping.

### Organizing with Test Fixtures

To avoid duplication and share setup/teardown code and test data:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each test runs independently with fresh fixture objects.

---

## Assertions: Detailed Checks

GoogleTest provides two categories of assertions:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`)** abort the current test immediately upon failure.
- **Nonfatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`)** report the failure but allow the test to continue.

Use assertions to ensure conditions meet expectations. For example:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors have different sizes";
for (int i = 0; i < x.size(); ++i) {
  EXPECT_EQ(x[i], y[i]) << "Mismatch at index " << i;
}
```

Customize assertions with streamed messages for clearer diagnostics.

---

## Parameterized and Typed Tests: Reusing Test Logic

GoogleTest lets you define tests that run with multiple input data or types:

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic for different input parameters.
- **Typed Tests:** Run the same test suite for each type in a list of types.

This avoids duplicated test code and ensures broad coverage with less effort.

---

## Death Tests: Safely Verifying Program Termination

Death tests help you verify that your code handles fatal errors or assertions gracefully:

```cpp
TEST(DeathTest, DiesOnInvalidInput) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(MyFunction(0), "Invalid input");
}
```

The test framework isolates death tests to run safely without stopping the entire test suite.

---

## Test Runner Features

GoogleTest’s built-in test runner supports:

- Filtering tests via command-line flags to run subsets.
- Controlling output verbosity.
- Shuffling tests to detect order dependencies.
- Returning error codes that can integrate with CI systems.

Example execution:

```bash
test_binary --gtest_filter=FactorialTest.* --gtest_shuffle
```

---

## Integration Capabilities

GoogleTest fits naturally into existing C++ workflows and popular build systems:

- Build with **CMake**, **Bazel**, or manual compilation.
- Comes with prebuilt main entry points (`gtest_main`) for easy linking.
- Supports cross-platform use (Linux, Windows, macOS).
