# Supported Platforms & Audience

## Platform Support Overview

GoogleTest rigorously follows [Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), providing a stable, well-maintained testing framework for C++ developers across a wide variety of platforms. This commitment ensures your testing suites run consistently and reliably, no matter the operating environment.

Supported platforms include, but are not limited to:

- **Linux** (including Android variants)
- **Windows** (Desktop, MinGW, and various Windows RT, Mobile, Phone partitions)
- **macOS and iOS**
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD**
- **Google Native Client (NaCl)**
- **Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, z/OS**
- **Other less common platforms** such as Fuchsia, QNX, Haiku

A comprehensive, regularly updated listing of supported versions, compilers, and tools can be found in the [official support matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Compiler and Build Tool Compatibility

GoogleTest is designed to build cleanly and run on compilers that conform to the C++17 standard or later, including but not limited to:

- GCC
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
- Intel Compiler

The project provides integration files and build instructions tailored for **CMake**, one of the most popular and cross-platform build systems. Whether integrating GoogleTest as a standalone project or embedding it into an existing build system, GoogleTest ensures smooth compilation and linkage.

For users leveraging other build systems or requiring pkg-config support, GoogleTest offers `.pc` files that provide the necessary compiler and linker flags.

## Intended Audience

GoogleTest is crafted for C++ developers focused on achieving thorough and reliable test coverage through automatic, maintainable testing workflows. It particularly benefits:

- **Individual developers and open source contributors** seeking a well-documented, easy-to-use test framework.
- **Development teams and organizations** requiring cross-platform, portable testing of C++ codebases.
- **Projects with diverse environments** needing consistent test behavior across different OSes and compiler toolchains.
- **Engineers adopting automated testing and continuous integration** pipelines with scalable and extensible test frameworks.

## Why Platform Support Matters

Targeting multiple platforms can expose subtle bugs and differences in behavior. GoogleTest's broad platform coverage ensures your tests reliably reflect your software's true portability and stability.

By aligning with Google's foundational C++ policies, GoogleTest minimizes surprises due to compiler quirks or platform peculiarities. This saves time and effort during development, integration, and deployment.

## Practical Considerations and Best Practices

- Verify your compiler and platform version against the supported matrix to ensure compatibility.

- Use GoogleTestâ€™s **CMake integration** to simplify building and linking on supported platforms.

- For cross-compilation or embedded platforms, consult the [Supported Platforms & Audience](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/platforms.md) documentation early to address environment-specific details.

- Leverage compiler and thread support macros provided by GoogleTest to conditionally compile platform-specific code paths.

- Take advantage of GoogleTest's thread-safe features on platforms where pthread or equivalent threading libraries are available.
