# Who Should Use GoogleTest?

## Empowering C++ Developers and Teams to Deliver Reliable Software

GoogleTest is crafted for C++ developers, open-source maintainers, and software teams who seek to elevate their code quality through rigorous, automated testing. Whether you are building small libraries or orchestrating massive continuous integration (CI) pipelines in large-scale projects, GoogleTest provides the essential framework to support your testing needs.

### Who Benefits Most from GoogleTest?

- **Individual C++ Developers:** If you write C++ code, GoogleTest helps you create robust unit and integration tests with minimum setup. Its familiar xUnit-style API makes learning and adoption efficient.

- **Open-Source Project Maintainers:** Facilitate vibrant, quality open-source communities by providing a standardized, easy-to-use testing infrastructure that encourages contributions with confidence.

- **Development Teams and Organizations:** GoogleTest scales to support teams of any size, seamlessly integrating into your build and CI systems to ensure continuous validation and regression prevention.

### Typical Project Scenarios

GoogleTest's flexibility covers a broad spectrum of project types and sizes:

- **Small to Medium-sized Libraries:** Quickly write focused unit tests targeting functionality and edge cases, ensuring correctness without complex build configurations.

- **Large-scale Applications:** Integrate GoogleTest at scale with continuous integration pipelines to run extensive suites of unit and integration tests, reducing bugs and improving reliability.

- **Embedded and Platform-Neutral Systems:** GoogleTest supports cross-platform testing on Linux, Windows, Mac, and other platforms that support C++17, making it suitable for portable projects.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Underestimating Test Organization:** Plan your test suites and fixtures with maintainability in mind to avoid brittle tests.

- **Ignoring Test Isolation:** Use test fixtures to isolate tests and prevent side effects from leaking, preserving test independence.

- **Skipping Continuous Integration Integration:** Automate test execution in your CI system early to benefit from fast feedback.

- **Neglecting Advanced Features:** Explore parameterized and typed tests when dealing with multiple input scenarios or type variations to reduce repetitive code.
