# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Introduction

Welcome to the foundational guide on the core concepts and terminology of GoogleTest. Before diving into writing tests and integrating the framework into your projects, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the key ideas and language that will empower you to write effective, maintainable, and powerful tests using GoogleTest.

This page provides a clear understanding of several fundamental GoogleTest concepts such as test cases, fixtures, assertions, death tests, parameterized and typed tests, as well as the extension capabilities brought by GoogleMock.

## What Are Test Cases and Test Suites?

In GoogleTest, a **test case** or **test suite** is a collection of related tests grouped to make test organization intuitive and logical. This grouping reflects the structure of your codebase, helping manage tests that operate on similar functionality or share fixtures.

### Example:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
}
```

Here, `FactorialTest` is the test case (or suite) name, and the tests `HandlesZeroInput` and `HandlesPositiveInput` belong to it.

## Fixtures: Sharing Common Setup

When multiple tests need to operate on the same objects or require the same initialization, **test fixtures** allow you to reuse setup and teardown code efficiently. A fixture is a C++ class derived from `testing::Test`.

### Usage flow:

1. Define a fixture class holding shared data and setup/teardown logic.
2. Write your tests using `TEST_F()` to leverage the fixture.

### Example:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Initial setup
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_; // empty queue
  Queue<int> q1_; // contains one element
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

This ensures each test runs with a fresh setup.

## Assertions: Verifying Expected Behavior

Assertions are the building blocks of your tests. They specify conditions you expect to be true. GoogleTest provides various assertions:

- `EXPECT_*` macros report failures but allow the test to continue.
- `ASSERT_*` macros abort the current function upon failure.

### Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Custom failure message";
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr);
```

They help capture both success and failure states clearly.

---

## Death Tests: Testing Failures and Exits

Death tests allow you to verify that your code fails or terminates under specific conditions, such as asserting preconditions or checking for program crashes.

They run the test body in a separate process and expect it to exit or crash as specified.

### Usage Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(DoSomethingThatShouldCrash(), "Error message regex");
```

---

## Parameterized and Typed Tests: Reusing Test Logic

GoogleTest facilitates writing tests that run the same logic over different input values or types, making your tests concise and scalable.

### Parameterized Tests:

You specify a test class describing your tests and then instantiate it with multiple parameters.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyParameterizedTest : public ::testing::Test {
  // ...
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyParameterizedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyParameterizedTest, DoesSomething) {
  // Test logic here
}
```

This enables testing across type variations without duplicating test code.

---

## Assertions: Powerful Checks Using GoogleTest and GoogleMock

Assertions in GoogleTest extend beyond simple equality or boolean checks. They provide rich, expressive testing capabilities:

- **Basic assertions:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.
- **Predicate assertions:** using user-defined or built-in predicate functions.
- **Matcher assertions:** for detailed checks on container elements or object properties.

GoogleMock builds on this by providing the ability to:

- Mock objects with virtual methods.
- Specify expectations on calls and argument values.
- Use matchers to validate complex argument conditions.

---

## GoogleMock: Extending GoogleTest with Mocking Capabilities

While GoogleTest offers the core framework for writing tests, GoogleMock extends it by enabling the creation and use of **mock objects**.

### What does GoogleMock enable?

- Easily define mock classes with the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Set **expectations** on how mocks are used, including how many times methods are called, with which arguments, and in what order.
- Control mock method behavior using `ON_CALL`, `EXPECT_CALL`, and actions like `Return()`, `Invoke()`, or custom behaviors.
- Use strictness modifiers like `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` to control warnings or errors on uninteresting calls.

### Why GoogleMock matters

It helps you **isolate dependencies** by mocking collaborators, testing **interactions** instead of only states, and **validate behaviors** precisely.

## Common Terminology

| Term                     | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Suite (Test Case)    | Group of related tests.                                         |
| Test (Test Function)      | An individual unit test verifying a specific behavior.         |
| Fixture                  | A class providing shared setup and teardown for multiple tests. |
| Assertion                | A statement in a test verifying a condition.                    |
| Death Test               | A test that verifies program termination under certain conditions. |
| Mock                     | A test double object with programmed behavior and expectations. |
| Matcher                  | An object specifying argument value expectations in mocks.      |
| Action                   | Behavior to perform when a mock method is called.               |

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Group related tests into test suites** for clarity and manageability.
- Use **fixtures** to avoid duplication and ensure consistent setup.
- Write **clear and specific assertions**; avoid over-specification to keep tests maintainable.
- Use **parameterized and typed tests** to maximize test coverage with minimal code duplication.
- Employ **GoogleMock** for mocking collaborators, especially to test interaction with external or complex components.
- Use the **strictness modes** (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) thoughtfully to balance between warnings and errors on unverified calls.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Uninteresting/mock method calls warning:** Use `NiceMock` to suppress excessive warnings when calls to mocks occur without explicit expectations.
- **Tests failing due to unexpected calls:** Make sure the relevant `EXPECT_CALL` statements are properly set before calling the tested code.
- **Mock classes must have virtual destructors:** If your mock is derived, ensure the base class's destructor is virtual to avoid leaks and undefined behavior.
