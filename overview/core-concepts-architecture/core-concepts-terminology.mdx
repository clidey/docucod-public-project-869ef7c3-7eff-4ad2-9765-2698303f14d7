# Core Concepts & Terminology

Discover the foundational elements that make up GoogleTest, the premier C++ testing framework. This page unpacks the essential vocabulary and concepts—test cases, fixtures, assertions, mocks, matchers, and parameterized tests—that empower you to write robust, effective tests quickly.

## Understanding the Basics: What You Need to Know First

Before you dive into writing tests, it's important to get familiar with the vocabulary that GoogleTest uses. Terminology in testing can sometimes be confusing due to varying definitions across frameworks and standards. GoogleTest clarifies these differences and aligns them with industry standards where possible.

### The Language of Testing in GoogleTest

| Concept Description                                                            | GoogleTest Term    | ISTQB Term         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| A specific piece of code executed with particular inputs and verifications.    | `TEST()` (a Test)  | Test Case          |
| A group of related tests bundled together to reflect the structure of the code | Test Suite (formerly Test Case) | Test Suite       |

> **Tip:** GoogleTest has migrated from the term *Test Case* to *Test Suite* to better align with common testing language. The older *Test Case* APIs are deprecated.

## Core Building Blocks Explained

### Assertions: The Heartbeat of Your Tests

Assertions are your checkpoints. They verify whether conditions hold true during test execution.

- **Success**: Condition met, test proceeds.
- **Nonfatal Failure**: Condition failed, but test continues.
- **Fatal Failure**: Condition failed, test stops immediately.

You'll typically start testing by writing assertions using macros. For example:

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y are of unequal length";
EXPECT_EQ(x[i], y[i]) << "Vectors x and y differ at index " << i;
```

The `ASSERT_*` macros abort the current function on failure, while `EXPECT_*` let the test continue logging more failures. Choose `EXPECT_*` when you want thorough feedback; use `ASSERT_*` when continuing doesn't make sense.

### Tests: Encapsulating Assertions with Purpose

Tests are simple functions defined with the `TEST()` macro that bundle assertions and execute the code under test.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(8), 40320);
}
```

GoogleTest runs each test individually, providing isolated environments to keep results independent and repeatable.

### Test Suites: Organizing Tests Effectively

Tests belong to *test suites*—collections of tests that share context or test similar functionality. Grouping related tests makes your suite maintainable and mirrors your code's structure.

- Use the same test suite name in `TEST()` calls to logically group tests.
- GoogleTest executes tests by test suites, allowing you to focus runs on specific areas or all tests collectively.

### Test Fixtures: Sharing Setup Across Multiple Tests

When multiple tests operate on the same initial setup, *test fixtures* help avoid redundant code and maintain consistency.

How to use fixtures:

1. Create a class derived from `testing::Test`.
2. Place shared objects and setup code in the fixture.
3. Use `TEST_F()` instead of `TEST()`, specifying the fixture class name.

Example:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each test uses a fresh fixture instance, ensuring test isolation and preventing side effects between tests.

## Expanding Your Testing Vocabulary

### Mocks and Matchers

Mocks simulate behavior of dependencies and provide controlled environments in your tests. Matchers simplify checking complex values and conditions, enhancing readability and expressiveness.

### Parameterized Tests

To test scenarios with varying inputs or types without duplicating code, GoogleTest offers:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests** for varying input data.
- **Typed Tests** to repeat tests across types.

You define a test logic template and provide different inputs or types. This dramatically scales test coverage while keeping tests concise.

## Why Mastering Terminology Matters

Getting comfortable with GoogleTest’s core concepts empowers you to:

- Write clearer, maintainable tests.
- Use advanced features like fixtures, parameterized tests, and mocking wisely.
- Debug failing tests faster with meaningful assertions and organization.

Understanding these foundations accelerates your journey from writing one-off tests to building extensive, reliable test suites that support your development lifecycle.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Avoid underscore (`_`) in test suite and test names.** This prevents internal name clashes and compiler errors.
- **Choose your assertions carefully:** Prefer `EXPECT_*` macros to catch multiple errors per test; use `ASSERT_*` when subsequent test code depends on the assertion passing.
- **Remember:** Each test runs with a fresh fixture instance; mutable state is not shared across tests.
- **Define `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` in fixtures correctly:** spelling mistakes (`Setup()` instead of `SetUp()`) will silently break setup calls.
- **Use parameterized tests to avoid duplication:** They offer scalable testing without code repetition.
