# Core Concepts & Terminology

Become fluent in the essential terms that form the backbone of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This page explains the key domain language—assertions, test cases, test suites, mocks, expectations, matchers, and actions—that every user must understand to write effective, maintainable tests and mocks.

---

## Why Master Core Terminology?

Test and mock design are communication. The clearer you speak the language of testing, the more precisely you can specify and verify software behavior. This page is your quick reference and foundation for mastering that language.

By knowing these terms, you will consistently write tests that are not only correct but expressive, robust, and easier to maintain.

## Key Concepts Defined

### Assertion
An **assertion** is a statement inside a test that verifies some condition is true. It answers the question: *Did the code do what it was supposed to?*

- Example: `EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value);`
- If an assertion fails, the test fails.

### Test Case
A **test case** is a single, focused unit of testing logic. It exercises a piece of code with specific parameters or inputs and verifies expected outcomes.

- Typically defined as a function marked with `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` in GoogleTest.
- Example: Testing that a calculator adds correctly.

### Test Suite
A **test suite** groups related test cases under one logical name.

- Allows organizing tests for a feature, class, or module.
- Example: A suite called `MathTests` may contain all arithmetic operation test cases.

### Mock Object
A **mock** is a simulated object that mimics the behavior of real dependencies, customized for test scenarios.

- Created using `MOCK_METHOD` macros inside a mock class.
- Allows specifying how methods should respond and checking whether methods were called correctly.

### Expectation
An **expectation** is a specification on a mock method that it will be called with certain arguments, a definite number of times, and possibly with specific behaviors.

- Defined with `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(args))`.
- It can constrain the order, frequency, and arguments of calls.

### Matcher
A **matcher** defines criteria to verify that arguments passed to mocked methods meet certain conditions.

- Some matchers are simple, like `_` (wildcard), `Eq(value)`, or more complex ones like `Lt(5)`, `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`.
- Matchers make expectations expressive and precise.

### Action
An **action** defines what a mock method actually does when called.

- Examples include returning a value (`Return(value)`), invoking a function (`Invoke()`), or setting an output argument (`SetArgPointee<N>(value)`).
- Actions are specified in `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` statements.

## How These Concepts Work Together: A User Flow

1. **Design a Test Case** that targets a specific functionality.
2. **Write Assertions** inside the test case to verify outcomes.
3. **Use Mocks** to simulate dependent objects, using `MOCK_METHOD` macros to define their methods.
4. **Set Expectations** on mocks with `EXPECT_CALL` to define how mocks should be used.
5. **Specify Matchers** to constrain arguments in expectations.
6. **Define Actions** to control mock responses.
7. **Run Tests** to verify that the code satisfies all assertions and expectations.

This flow lets you write tests that verify interactions (mock expectations) and state (assertions), making tests clearer and less brittle.

## Practical Examples

### Defining a Mock Method

```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetData, (int id), (override));
};
```

### Expecting a Call With Specific Argument

```cpp
MockDatabase mock_db;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect(Eq("db://localhost")))
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

### Using a Matcher Wildcard

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, GetData(_))  // Accepts any int argument.
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(42));
```

### Combining Matchers

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, GetData(AllOf(Ge(0), Lt(100))))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(99));
```

### Setting Default Behavior

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect(_))
    .WillByDefault(Return(false));
```

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Always mock methods in `public` section** of your mock class even if the base methods are protected or private. This allows external references to the mock methods.

- **Don’t over-specify expectations.** Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors and keep `EXPECT_CALL` for important specific call verifications.

- **Specify expectations before exercising the mock** to avoid undefined behaviors.

- **Use matchers thoughtfully**—avoid overly strict argument requirements unless needed.

- **Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wisely** to control how uninteresting calls are treated.
