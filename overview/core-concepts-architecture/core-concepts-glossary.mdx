# Core Concepts & Glossary

Welcome to the foundational page of GoogleTest documentation that introduces and defines essential terms you will encounter while writing and organizing tests in C++. This page bridges the conceptual understanding of test entities with their concrete representations in GoogleTest, providing short, practical examples for rapid adoption.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the terminology and how it maps to GoogleTest code is critical. Clear concepts help you organize tests effectively, create maintainable test suites, and leverage Google Test's rich functionality like assertions, parameterized tests, and death tests.

---

## Major Terms and Their Meanings

Let's break down the key concepts and show how they translate to C++ code with GoogleTest.

### Test Fixture

A **test fixture** is a class that sets up a common environment used by multiple tests. It lets you reuse setup and teardown code efficiently, avoiding repetition.

- **In GoogleTest:** You create a fixture by subclassing `testing::Test` and adding any necessary setup and member variables.

**Example:**
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);  // Prepare test data
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;  // Empty queue
  Queue<int> q1_;  // Contains one element
  Queue<int> q2_;  // Contains two elements
};
```

### Test Case / Test Suite

Historically, GoogleTest used the term *test case*, but current terminology prefers **test suite**, which is a collection of related tests that logically group test functions.

- Each test suite can share setup by associating with a test fixture.
- Test cases and test suites conceptually represent the same entity, though the API prefers *test suite*.

**In GoogleTest:**

- `TEST()` defines a test function within a test suite.
- `TEST_F()` defines a test using a test fixture; the test suite is named after the fixture.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}
```

### Test

A **test** is a function that exercises some functionality and contains assertions to verify correctness.

- Can be thought of as a single unit of verification.
- Succeeds if all assertions pass and the test does not crash.

**In GoogleTest:** Defined via `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.

### Assertion

An **assertion** checks a condition or compares values to confirm expected behavior.

- Types: nonfatal (`EXPECT_*`) and fatal (`ASSERT_*`).
- Fatal assertions abort the current test function when failed.
- You can stream custom failure messages with `<<`.

**Example:**
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(x.size(), y.size()) << "Vectors x and y lengths differ";
EXPECT_TRUE(IsValid(x)) << "Input x is invalid";
```

### Matcher

A **matcher** describes the condition or pattern used to check a value in assertions, especially with `EXPECT_THAT` from GoogleMock style assertions.

- Enables expressive, readable conditions such as `StartsWith()`, `HasSubstr()`, `MatchesRegex()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("Hello"));
EXPECT_THAT(output, MatchesRegex("error \d+"));
```

### Death Test

**Death tests** verify code behavior that causes the program to terminate unexpectedly (e.g., fatal errors, aborts).

- Run in a separate process to isolate failures.
- Verify the program dies and optionally that the error output matches expectations.

**In GoogleTest:** Use macros like `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)`.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MyDeathTest, CrashesOnInvalidInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(DoSomethingBad(), "Invalid input detected");
}
```

### Parameterized Test

Tests that run multiple times with different parameters, enabling data-driven testing without repetition.

- Define a fixture inheriting from `TestWithParam<T>`.
- Use `TEST_P()` to define test logic.
- Instantiate parameters with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesVariousInts) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

### Type-Parameterized Test

When the same test logic needs to be applied to multiple types:

- Define a fixture class template.
- Use the `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` macro to specify types.
- Use `TYPED_TEST` macros for tests using the `TypeParam` alias.

**Example:**
```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, IsDefaultConstructed) {
  TypeParam val = this->value_;
  EXPECT_EQ(val, TypeParam());
}
```

### Type-Parameterized Test Suite

This is an abstract test pattern using fixture templates that is defined separately and instantiated with different type lists later.

- Define test patterns with `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `TYPED_TEST_P`.
- Register test names using `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Instantiate tests using `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

Allows multiple instantiations with different types in different translation units.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent clashes with internal naming conventions. See the [FAQ on underscores](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore).
- Use `TEST_F` when you have common setup/teardown or shared data to avoid duplication.
- Favor nonfatal assertions (`EXPECT_`) where it makes sense to allow multiple failures per test run.
- When creating value-parameterized tests, use expressive names for parameters via custom name generators for clarity in test reports.
- Apply death tests to verify conditions that cause process termination, isolating these in dedicated test suites with the `*DeathTest` suffix.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- If you get errors about no default constructor for a fixture, ensure your fixture class has a default constructor as GoogleTest needs to instantiate it.
- Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) abort only the current function, not the entire test by default; consider using `HasFatalFailure()` to propagate fatal failure effects.
- Death tests run in subprocesses; any state changes in them will not be visible in the parent process.
