# Feature Overview

Discover the powerful features that make GoogleTest and GoogleMock the premier C++ testing and mocking frameworks. This page provides a concise yet comprehensive snapshot of essential and advanced capabilities available to you, designed to help you identify which features best align with your project’s requirements and testing goals.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest automates the discovery of all tests defined in your test program. No need for manual registration or enumeration — simply write your tests using the provided macros, and GoogleTest handles the rest.

- Write tests using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` macros.
- All tests are automatically collected and executed when calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Supports running individual tests or test suites in isolation for faster debugging.

**Benefit:** Saves you from tedious bookkeeping and ensures your test suite stays current as it grows.

---

## Rich Assertion APIs

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive set of assertion macros that check conditions and report informative messages when tests fail.

- Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) abort the current test immediately upon failure.
- Non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) record a failure but continue the test.
- Assertions cover general conditions, value equality, string comparisons, exceptions, and more.
- Supports streaming custom failure messages for detailed debugging.

**Example:**

```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Mismatch at step X";
```

**Benefit:** Provides precise, expressive assertions that help you pinpoint problems quickly.

## GoogleMock Integration for Advanced Mocking

GoogleMock is tightly integrated within GoogleTest, empowering you to create mock classes easily and specify complex interactions.

- Define mocks with the powerful `MOCK_METHOD()` macro handling virtual and even templated methods.
- Set expectations on method calls with `EXPECT_CALL()`, and configure behaviors and return values.
- Offers sophisticated matchers to validate function arguments precisely.
- Supports partial mocks, ordering constraints, uninteresting call policies, default actions, and more.

This deep integration keeps your testing framework lightweight and consistent while supporting all your mocking needs.

---

## Death Tests for Crash Detection

GoogleTest supports *death tests* to verify that code crashes as expected under certain conditions.

- Run tests in subprocesses to catch fatal errors and signals safely.
- Useful for validating error handling, assertions in production code, and invalid states.

**Use Case:** Ensure your code fails as intended on invalid input without breaking the entire test suite.

---

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest offers versatile test parameterization options that reduce code duplication and improve coverage.

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with different input values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Write tests once and run across different types.
- **Combinatorial Testing:** Combine multiple parameters for exhaustive testing.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> { ... };
TEST_P(MyTest, HandlesValues) { ... }
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P( ..., MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

**Benefit:** Dramatically increase your test scope while keeping test code clean and maintainable.

---

## Versatile Test Execution Options

GoogleTest provides flexible ways to run and control tests to suit various development workflows:

- Run all tests or limit execution to specific test suites or tests via filter flags.
- Control test ordering, repeat counts, and sharding across processes.
- Configure output formats including plain text, XML, or JSON for CI integration.
- Adjust verbosity levels and disable colors to fit your environment.

**Benefit:** More control over test runs means faster feedback and smoother integration with build systems.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `EXPECT_CALL()` sparingly:** Only set expectations for interactions you want to verify. Use `ON_CALL()` for default behaviors.
- **Take advantage of `NiceMock` and `StrictMock`** to control uninteresting call warnings and errors.
- **Use parameterized tests** to avoid duplicating similar test cases.
- **Implement sequences (`InSequence`)** when order of calls matters.
- **Review mock verification failures immediately:** Mismatched expectations hint at test or code logic issues.
- **Avoid mocking classes you do not own** when possible; prefer wrappers or adaptors.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

- If your mock expectations fail unexpectedly, ensure you **set expectations before exercising the mock**.
- Beware of **sticky expectations**; use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` when expecting sequential, discrete calls.
- If your tests show unwarranted warnings about uninteresting calls, consider using `NiceMock` or specify times with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- When mocking methods with complex or move-only arguments, use lambdas or custom actions.
