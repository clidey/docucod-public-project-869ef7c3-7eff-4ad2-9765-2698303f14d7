# Platform Support, Integrations & Dependencies

## Ensuring Broad Compatibility Across Environments

GoogleTest is designed to integrate seamlessly into a wide range of C++ development environments. This page highlights the core platform support, third-party dependencies, and typical integrations that make GoogleTest robust and flexible for modern C++ testing workflows.

### Why This Matters

To confidently adopt GoogleTest, users need to understand its compatibility with compilers, platforms, and build systems, along with how it interacts with continuous integration (CI) tools and alternative test runners. This knowledge empowers you to plan your test suite architecture, dependency management, and integration strategy smoothly.

---

## Platform and Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest supports all major platforms where C++17 is available, including:

- **Linux** distributions
- **Windows** (including Windows Mobile)
- **macOS**
- Certain embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, and NRF52 with Arduino

This broad compatibility has been carefully maintained through conditional implementation supporting platform-specific entry points and threading models.

> **Best Practice:** Target environments with support for C++17 or higher, as it is required for building and running GoogleTest successfully.

### Supported Compilers

GoogleTest builds successfully with any modern C++17-compliant compiler, including:

- GCC 7.0 and above
- Clang 5.0 and above
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and later

### Threading Model

- Uses `pthreads` on POSIX-compliant systems for thread safety.
- On platforms lacking pthread support, thread safety is limited.

> **Tip:** If your environment doesn’t correctly detect pthread support, explicitly enable or disable pthread support via compiler flags:
>
> ```
> -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  // Enable
> -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  // Disable
> ```

## Core Dependencies

### C++17 Standard

C++17 is a mandatory prerequisite due to the utilization of features introduced in this standard across GoogleTest's codebase. Configuring your build system to enable C++17 compliance ensures compatibility.

### Abseil Library (Upcoming Dependency)

GoogleTest is evolving to depend on the Abseil common libraries, which provide portable utilities that enhance GoogleTest’s infrastructure. This dependency aims to reduce platform-specific code and improve maintainability.

> **Note:** Currently, Abseil is optional or minimal; watch for updates on this integration in future releases.

### Build System Compatibility

GoogleTest officially supports several widely used build systems and workflows:

- **CMake:** Preferred method for building and integrating GoogleTest. Supports standalone builds and embedding as a subdirectory.
- **Bazel:** Supported, especially in large-scale Google-oriented projects.
- **Makefiles, Visual Studio, Xcode:** GoogleTest provides project files or compatible outputs to work with these common native tools.

## Integration with Continuous Integration and Test Runners

GoogleTest’s design embraces automation and continuous testing:

- **CI Support:** Runs efficiently in common CI platforms like Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions, and others.
- **Test Discovery:** Automatically discovers all tests in a binary, facilitating integration with test runners that parse GoogleTest’s output.
- **Exit Codes:** Returns precise exit codes via `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to signal test pass/fail status to CI tools.

### Alternative Test Runners

GoogleTest can be executed in conjunction with or replaced by custom runners that parse its XML or JSON output formats.

> **Tip:** Use GoogleTest’s XML output flags (`--gtest_output=xml:filename.xml`) to consume test results in custom dashboards or CI reports.

---

## Customization and User Configuration

GoogleTest also supports user-defined customization points for integration into specialized environments:

- Overriding temporary directory locations (`GTEST_CUSTOM_TEMPDIR_FUNCTION_`)
- Custom stack trace capturing implementations
- Control over logging and threading behavior through macros defined in `gtest-port.h`

Such hooks allow integration into embedded, constrained, or non-standard platforms, enhancing portability.

## How GoogleTest Fits Into Your Workflow

### Typical Integration Flow

1. **Install Dependencies and Build**
   - Ensure C++17 compiler support.
   - Install or embed GoogleTest via CMake or your preferred build system.
2. **Configure Your Build**
   - Link against `gtest` or `gtest_main` (for built-in main) libraries.
   - Define relevant macros if customizing for your environment.
3. **Run Tests Locally and in CI**
   - Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to run full test suite.
   - Collect output in compatible formats for CI tools.
4. **Extend and Customize**
   - Provide configuration overrides if needed for platform-specific scenarios.

### Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to enable C++17 support in older build scripts.
- Not handling platform-specific main functions correctly on embedded targets.
- Missing pthread linkage flags on POSIX systems causing link errors.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform and Integration Issues">
<Accordion title="C++17 Support Errors">
If your compiler throws errors related to C++ versions, ensure that the build flags explicitly target C++17 standard or later. For CMake, add:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors Due to Missing pthread">
On POSIX platforms, failure to link pthread can cause unresolved symbols. In CMake, adding `find_package(Threads REQUIRED)` and linking `${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}` resolves this.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Platform-Specific Entry Points Not Working">
Embedded platforms require specific main entry points (e.g., `setup()` and `loop()` for Arduino). Use GoogleTest/GoogleMock versions tailored for these platforms and consult the corresponding README sections.
