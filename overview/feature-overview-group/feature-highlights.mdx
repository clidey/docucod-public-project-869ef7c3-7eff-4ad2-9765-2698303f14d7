# Key Features at a Glance

Unlock the power of comprehensive, expressive, and flexible testing with GoogleTest. Designed to accelerate your C++ development, GoogleTest equips you with a rich set of features that streamline test discovery, assertion logic, mocking capabilities, parameterization, and reporting.

## Unveiling GoogleTest's Core Capabilities

GoogleTest brings together essential testing components into a single framework, enabling you to focus on what matters most: writing clear, maintainable, and powerful tests. Here's a rundown of its standout features:

### Diverse Suite of Assertions

GoogleTest offers a broad range of assertion macros to verify your code, from simple Boolean checks to in-depth predicate assertions. You'll find the right assertion for every scenario:

- **Basic Assertions:** Confirm conditions with `EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_NE`, and comparable macros to catch equality, inequality, or truthiness.
- **Predicate-Based Assertions:** Craft complex condition checks with detailed failure messages using `EXPECT_PRED*` and `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` macros.
- **Exception Assertions:** Verify that your code correctly throws or avoids exceptions, supporting robust error handling tests.
- **Floating-Point Comparisons:** Handle the nuances of floats and doubles with specialized assertions like `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`.
- **Death Assertions:** Test code paths expected to terminate your program, using macros such as `EXPECT_DEATH` and `ASSERT_EXIT`.

This extensive assertion toolkit ensures your tests provide clear, actionable feedback.

### Intelligent Test Discovery and Filtering

GoogleTest automatically identifies all tests defined in your test binary without requiring manual enumeration. This facilitates:

- **Listing Tests:** Use the `--gtest_list_tests` flag to display all available tests, helping you discover test names for filtering.
- **Selective Execution:** Run targeted subsets with the `--gtest_filter` flag, combining positive and negative patterns using wildcards to focus your debugging or test runs.
- **Disabling and Enabling Tests:** Temporarily exclude problematic tests by prefixing names with `DISABLED_` or include disabled tests with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`, keeping your workflow flexible.

### Powerful Mocking Tools

GoogleTest integrates GoogleMock to provide sophisticated mocking capabilities:

- **Mock Object Creation:** Define mock classes to simulate behavior of dependencies.
- **Expectation Setting:** Specify expected calls, invocation order, and return behaviors.
- **Matcher Support:** Use built-in and custom matchers to validate argument values precisely.
- **Behavioral Modes:** Control strictness and default behaviors of mock objects.

Combined, these enable thorough verification of interaction patterns and side effects.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests for Scalable Coverage

Reduce duplication and boost test coverage by writing adaptable tests:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Define tests that run multiple times with different input values via `TEST_P` and instantiate them with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`. This is ideal for data-driven testing.
- **Typed Tests:** Write template-test suites that run with a fixed set of types, defined via `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and used with `TYPED_TEST`. Perfect for testing type-generic code.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Like typed tests but with decoupled type list definition and instantiation, allowing more flexible reuse using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`.

These constructs dramatically simplify testing across multiple data and type variants.

### Flexible and Rich Test Reporting

Gain deep insights with multiple reporting formats and customization options:

- **Textual Console Output:** Rich, colored output detailing each test's status, including per-assertion results.
- **XML and JSON Reports:** Generate machine-readable test results via `--gtest_output=xml:filename` or `json:filename` for integration with CI and dashboards.
- **Property Recording:** Log custom key-value pairs per test or suite using `RecordProperty()`, integrating additional metadata into test reports.
- **Event Listener API:** Hook into test life-cycle events for customized reporting, logging, or GUI integration.

### Example Feature Usage

```cpp
// Basic test returning success or failure
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}

// A value-parameterized test
class StringLengthTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};

TEST_P(StringLengthTest, IsNonEmpty) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam().size(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Examples, StringLengthTest,
                         testing::Values("abc", "def", "ghi"));

// Typed test example
template <typename T>
class NumericTest : public testing::Test {};

using NumericTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, float>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(NumericTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(NumericTest, IsPositiveByDefault) {
  TypeParam value = TypeParam();  // default constructed
  EXPECT_LE(value, 0);  // Here just as example, runs for int, double, float
}
```

### Best Practices and Tips

- Use `ASSERT_*` for conditions that must be met for the test to continue.
- When writing parameterized tests, provide meaningful parameter names to ease diagnosis.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information to failures inside loops or called functions.
- Disable flaky or broken tests temporarily with `DISABLED_` prefix, but track and fix them promptly.
- Extend the value printer for your custom types via `PrintTo()` or `AbslStringify()` to get readable failure outputs.

### Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- Remember that failed `ASSERT_*`s abort the current function only, not the whole test program.
- Ensure you do not mix different test fixture classes within the same test suite.
- Avoid assertion macros in constructors or destructors; instead, use `SetUp` and `TearDown`.
- If using death tests, be aware they run in a subprocess and side effects don't propagate back.
