# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Mastering the Language of Testing with GoogleTest & GoogleMock

Testing with GoogleTest and GoogleMock starts with understanding the essential terminology that defines your testing journey. This page empowers you by demystifying key concepts like test cases, assertions, fixtures, mocks, matchers, and parameterized tests. By mastering this vocabulary, you'll confidently navigate the documentation, API reference, and advanced guides, making your test development faster, clearer, and more effective.

## Why Terminology Matters

Imagine you're navigating a complex codebase with unfamiliar testing jargon. Knowing exactly what a “test fixture” versus a “mock” is can transform confusion into clarity. These foundational terms are more than words—they are the building blocks that help you write reliable and maintainable tests. This page helps you bridge that gap so you can focus on what really matters: *validating your code's correctness efficiently.*

---

## Key Terms Explained

### 1. Test
>A single logical verification unit that exercises a behavior or function of your code.

Each test is typically a function defined using the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macro. Tests use assertions to verify expected outcomes, and each test either passes or fails independently of others.

### 2. Test Suite (formerly Test Case)
>A named group of related tests.

In GoogleTest, tests are logically grouped into test suites to organize test code and share setup/teardown logic. The modern term is **Test Suite**, replacing the older term **Test Case** to align with common testing terminology.

### 3. Assertion
>A command that checks whether a given condition holds true.

Assertions like `ASSERT_EQ` or `EXPECT_TRUE` evaluate conditions during tests. They can be *fatal* (abort the current test on failure) or *nonfatal* (continue testing but mark failure).

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected_value) << "Mismatch in calculation result";
```

### 4. Fixture (Test Fixture)
>A class that shares common objects, setup, and teardown code among multiple tests.

Fixtures provide a consistent environment so that tests can reuse resources, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

Example: 
```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    shared_resource = InitializeResource();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    CleanUp(shared_resource);
  }
  Resource* shared_resource;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestOne) {
  ASSERT_NE(shared_resource, nullptr);
  // test logic here
}
```

### 5. Mock
>A specialized test object that simulates the behavior of real objects.

Using GoogleMock, mocks simulate dependencies to control and verify interactions, allowing you to isolate the component under test.

Example:
```cpp
class MockDatabase : public DatabaseInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Disconnect, (), (override));
};
```

### 6. Matcher
>A predicate that defines constraints for arguments in mock method calls or assertions.

Matchers let you specify expected properties of arguments, improving test expressiveness. Built-in matchers include `Eq()`, `Gt()`, `HasSubstr()`, etc.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetName(HasSubstr("admin"))).Times(1);
```

### 7. Parameterized Tests
>Tests executed multiple times with different input parameters.

This enables data-driven testing without duplicating code. GoogleTest offers **Value-Parameterized Tests** (using `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) and **Typed Tests** to run the same test logic across different types.

Example of value-parameterized test:
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, HandlesEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

### 8. Expectations
>A declaration about how mock methods are expected to be called.

Expectations verify behavior by specifying how often or in what order mocked methods should be called.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Connect()).Times(1);
```

### 9. Test Program
>A compiled executable that runs multiple test suites and tests.

It is launched once and runs all tests that match filter criteria, reporting overall pass/fail status.

## How These Concepts Work Together: A Typical User Flow

1. **Create a Test Suite** by defining a test fixture class when needed.
2. **Write Tests** within the test suite using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, making assertions about expected behavior.
3. **Use Mocks** to simulate dependencies if isolation or interaction verification is required.
4. **Leverage Matchers** to express argument constraints in mock expectations.
5. **Use Parameterized Tests** to execute the same test logic on multiple inputs or types.
6. **Run Your Test Program** and interpret the test results.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Avoid underscore `_` in test suite or test names:** GoogleTest reserves `_` for internal use, so omit underscores to prevent name collisions.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` for nonfatal checks and `ASSERT_*` for critical failures:** This allows tests to continue running when it makes sense.
- **Use fixtures to reuse setup/teardown logic and shared objects:** This reduces boilerplate and makes tests cleaner.
- **Use mocks only when necessary:** Mock only external dependencies or complex objects to avoid overcomplicating tests.
- **Name parameterized tests clearly:** Use meaningful names in the instantiation to help with debugging.
- **Understand assertion scopes:** Place fatal assertions only in void-returning functions to avoid compilation errors.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Why do my `ASSERT_*` assertions cause compiler errors in constructors?**
  Constructors aren’t void-returning; move assertions to `SetUp()` methods.

- **Test names exist but don't run?**
  Ensure no underscores in test or suite names and confirm filters in command line aren’t excluding them.

- **Tests dependent on each other?**
  Each test is run independently with its own fixture; share state explicitly if needed but avoid hidden dependencies.

- **Death tests failing or hanging?**
  Death tests run in subprocesses and expect termination; avoid having multiple active threads outside death test scopes.
