# Integration & Compatibility

GoogleTest positions itself as a robust, versatile C++ testing framework that integrates smoothly with a wide range of compilers, platforms, build systems, and development environments. This page unpacks how GoogleTest fits into the broader C++ ecosystem to provide seamless experience whether you are starting fresh or integrating it into complex projects.

## Supported Compilers and Platforms

GoogleTest supports a wide array of C++ compilers and operating systems to ensure maximum portability and usability:

- **Compilers:**
  - GCC
  - Clang
  - Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)
  - Intel C++ Compiler
  - Other standard-conforming compilers with reasonable C++11 support

- **Platforms:**
  - Linux (various distributions)
  - macOS
  - Windows (including Windows Mobile and Windows Phone variants as supported)
  - Android
  - BSD systems
  - Embedded and special platforms (Arduino, ESP8266, etc.) with partial or limited support

Full support depends on compiler adherence to modern C++ standards and suitable platform capabilities.

## Interoperability with Build Systems

GoogleTest is engineered to flexibly integrate with most common C++ build workflows and dependency management approaches:

- **Manual Build and Integration:**
  - You can directly clone and build GoogleTest sources within your project repository.
  - Compiling the code with your toolchain, then linking the resultant static or shared libraries is straightforward.

- **Package Managers and Dependency Systems:**
  - Widely used C++ package managers (e.g., conan, vcpkg) support GoogleTest for easy installation and version management.

- **Bazel Integration:**
  - Provides native rules for building and running tests [see Bazel's official documentation](https://docs.bazel.build).
  - GoogleTest automatically reads styling from environment and integrates with Bazel's test structures.

- **CMake:**
  - Official CMake support is provided with `FetchContent` or external project modules.
  - Easily integrate GoogleTest targets and options into your CMake build, enabling automatic discovery and linking.

- **Other Toolchains:**
  - Works with Makefiles, Ninja, Xcode, and Visual Studio solutions.
  - Supports cross-compilation scenarios with appropriate configuration.

## Integration with Other Tools and Frameworks

- **GoogleMock:**
  - Included as a subcomponent, tightly integrated with GoogleTest.
  - Mocking capabilities complement test writing with expectation management.

- **Continuous Integration Systems:**
  - GoogleTest’s output formats (`--gtest_output=xml:` and JSON) enable integration with popular CI systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
  - Supports test filtering and sharding to optimize distributed test execution.

- **Test Event Listeners and Extensions:**
  - Pluggable event listener API allows integration with IDEs, dashboards, and coverage tools.
  - You can add custom listeners to tailor output or interact with external tools.

- **Sanitizers and Debuggers:**
  - Supports Address, Undefined Behavior, and Thread Sanitizers.
  - Break-on-failure and exception catching are compatible with common debugging sessions.

## Planned Dependency on Abseil (Absl)

GoogleTest plans to progressively adopt the [Abseil C++ common libraries](https://abseil.io/), improving utility components such as string handling, flag parsing, and synchronization primitives. Users integrating GoogleTest should prepare to support or install Abseil as a dependency in the future. This transition aims to modernize the internal codebase while preserving backward compatibility.

## Guidance for First-Time Integrators

If you are new to integrating GoogleTest:

1. **Installation:**
   - Use the latest stable release from the [official repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).
   - Prefer package managers compatible with your environment for automatic updates and easier dependency management.

2. **Build:**
   - Follow the recommended CMake or Bazel build instructions.
   - When adapting to other build systems, compile the `googletest` and `googlemock` directories separately as static libraries for reuse.

3. **Linking:**
   - Link GoogleTest frameworks statically or dynamically as convenient.
   - Avoid linking test code into production binaries unless explicitly desired.

4. **Compatibility Checks:**
   - Verify that your compiler supports the C++11 features GoogleTest depends on.
   - Run the provided tests and examples to confirm integration.

5. **Refer to Official Documentation:**
   - Check out the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/requirements-supported-platforms) for detailed, platform-specific instructions.

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

- **Symbols not found:**
  - Ensure you link both `gtest` and `gmock` libraries correctly.
  - Verify correct build for your target architecture.

- **Compile errors on older compilers:**
  - Use a newer compiler with proper C++11 support.
  - Alternatively, check for older versions of GoogleTest compatible with your toolchain.

- **Runtime test discovery problems:**
  - Check that `InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` is called early.
  - Ensure no conflicts in test suite names or fixture classes.

- **Output formatting issues:**
  - When generating XML or JSON output, ensure that output directories exist and are writable.
