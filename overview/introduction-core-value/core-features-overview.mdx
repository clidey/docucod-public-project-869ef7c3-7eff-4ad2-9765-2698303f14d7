# Core Features at a Glance

GoogleTest is a powerful C++ testing framework designed to make your unit testing efficient, expressive, and scalable. This page highlights its central features in a focused summary, showing how they support modern C++ development with practical and robust testing capabilities.

---

## Rich xUnit-Style Testing Framework

GoogleTest embraces the xUnit architecture, providing:

- **Simple test structures:** Organize your tests into test cases and test suites with clear naming.
- **Automated test discovery:** No manual registration needed — GoogleTest finds and runs your tests automatically.
- **Powerful lifecycle hooks:** Use setup and teardown fixtures at the test and test suite level for precise control over test environments.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  Foo foo;
  EXPECT_EQ(foo.Process(0), 0);
}
```

This structure helps keep tests organized and execution straightforward.

## Automated Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests by scanning compiled sources and runs them seamlessly, eliminating tedious manual steps. This means your testing workflow is streamlined:

- Write tests in any translation unit.
- Build your test binary.
- Run the executable — it discovers and executes all tests.

This automation accelerates integration into continuous integration pipelines and daily development.

## Extensive and Expressive Assertions

Built-in assertions cover a vast range of validation checks, including equality, inequality, floating-point comparisons, exceptions, and more. Noteworthy aspects:

- Support for **user-defined assertions** lets you tailor checks for your domain objects.
- Flexible **matchers** empower expressive patterns for argument validation.
- Clear failure messages expedite diagnosis.

Example assertion:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(MyFunc(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_THAT(container, Contains(expected_element));
```


## GoogleMock: Powerful Mocking Capabilities

Deeply integrated with GoogleTest is GoogleMock, allowing precise testing of interactions:

- **Declarative mock class generation** with the `MOCK_METHOD` macro makes mocking interfaces effortless.
- Set **expectations on method calls** (number, order, arguments).
- Support for **nice, naggy, and strict mocks**, adjusting verbosity and strictness.
- Works with **overloaded and templated methods**.
- Flexible **actions** let you define return values, side effects, and delegate to real or fake objects.

Example:

```cpp
class MockDatabase : public DatabaseInterface {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Fetch, (int id), (override));
};

MockDatabase mock_db;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1).WillOnce(Return(true));
```

This allows you to isolate and verify behavior of components dependent on external systems.

## Death Tests and Exception Testing

GoogleTest supports robust verification of programs that are intended to terminate or throw exceptions in certain situations. Death tests help ensure your code behaves safely when encountering fatal errors, validating:

- Program termination under error conditions.
- Proper exception propagation and catching.

This feature ensures your error handling paths are covered and reliable.

## Broad Support for Parameterized and Typed Tests

Write comprehensive tests that cover multiple input scenarios efficiently:

- **Parameterized tests:** Instantiate the same test logic with different data values to cover edge cases and a variety of inputs.
- **Typed tests:** Test the same interface or class template with multiple types without duplication of code.

Example:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

This pattern dramatically improves coverage while keeping tests concise.

## Why These Features Matter for C++ Developers

GoogleTest's blend of features fits naturally into mainstream C++ development workflows:

- **Enhance test reliability:** Automated discovery and expressive assertions reduce test flakiness and increase clarity.
- **Facilitate interaction testing:** GoogleMock provides granular control to validate complex dependencies and interactions.
- **Speed up development:** Parameterized and typed tests offer extensive coverage with minimal extra code.
- **Ensure correctness in failure paths:** Death and exception tests cover edge cases critical for robust applications.

Embracing these features gives developers confidence that their C++ code behaves correctly now and as it evolves.

## Practical Tips

- Use **`EXPECT_CALL` sparingly and precisely** to avoid brittle tests.
- Combine **`ON_CALL` with default actions** to specify behavior without strict expectations.
- For **parameterized tests**, clearly define input sets to increase meaningful coverage.
- Leverage **mock strictness modes** (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) to balance verbosity and test strictness.
- When writing **mock classes**, place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in public sections regardless of the original access.
