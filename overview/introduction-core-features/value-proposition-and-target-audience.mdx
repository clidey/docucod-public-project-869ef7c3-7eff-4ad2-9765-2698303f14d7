### Practical Tips and Best Practices
- Use GoogleTest as part of your development cycle to catch issues early and reduce debugging time.
- Prefer defining expectations only when you truly want to verify that interactions occur; otherwise, use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors without adding brittle constraints.
- Take advantage of GoogleTest’s mocking capabilities to isolate units and create fast, deterministic tests.
- Utilize sequences and ordering features to model complex interaction flows.
- Run tests regularly across all target platforms to leverage GoogleTest’s cross-platform support.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-specifying expectations can make tests brittle and maintenance heavy—use constraints judiciously.
- Neglecting to verify mocks can allow uncaught issues; GoogleTest automates verification but be aware of lifetime and scope.
- Mixing test styles (state-based vs interaction-based) without clarity can reduce test reliability.

By adopting GoogleTest thoughtfully, you position your team to deliver cleaner, safer, and more maintainable C++ software with confidence.
