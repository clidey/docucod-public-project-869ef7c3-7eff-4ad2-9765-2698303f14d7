# Key Features at a Glance

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a powerful, comprehensive suite of tools designed to make your C++ testing and mocking needs scalable and efficient. Whether you aim to verify your code behavior with clear expectations, simulate complex interactions, or write readable, maintainable tests, this page introduces the essential capabilities you need to know—fast.

---

## xUnit Compatibility: Familiar and Reliable

GoogleTest embraces the widely-adopted xUnit testing style, making it intuitive for those coming from other testing frameworks. This compatibility means you can write tests structured around test fixtures, assertions, and test cases with ease. Your team benefits from a familiar workflow that integrates seamlessly into your development cycle.

- Use test fixtures to share setup and teardown logic.
- Organize tests into suites that clearly communicate intent.
- Leverage assertion macros that produce detailed diagnostics on failure.

## Powerful Assertions: Express What Matters

GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertion macros that let you validate conditions precisely and clearly:

- `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*` macros for checking conditions, with failures that either continue or abort the test.
- Support for complex predicates and value matchers to verify a broad range of state and behavior.
- Integration with GoogleMock matchers to assert on mock calls and interaction details.

These assertions empower you to pinpoint issues quickly while keeping tests readable.

## Automatic Test Discovery & Execution

Never manually register your tests again. GoogleTest automatically discovers tests across your project and runs them with configurable execution options:

- Command-line flags to filter which tests to run.
- Options to control test repetitions, sharding, and death tests.
- Rich reporting outputs in various formats (console, XML) to integrate into CI pipelines.

This smooth automation saves time and reduces configuration overhead.

## Parameterized Tests: Write Once, Test Many

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests, letting you run the same test logic against a range of inputs:

- Define test fixtures with type or value parameters.
- Run tests across multiple data sets seamlessly.
- Focus on the testing logic without duplicating code.

This feature accelerates your coverage and robustness without redundancy.

## Advanced Mocking with GoogleMock

GoogleMock integrates tightly with GoogleTest, providing an expressive framework to create mock classes and specify interactions:

- **Declarative Mock Definitions**: Use simple macros (`MOCK_METHOD`) to generate mock implementations of interfaces or classes.
- **Intuitive Syntax for Expectations**: Specify which methods to expect, argument constraints, call counts, invocation order, and behaviors using clear, chainable clauses.
- **Flexible Matchers and Actions**: Validate argument content with built-in and custom matchers, and define what mocks return or do when invoked.
- **Ordering and Cardinalities**: Enforce call order through sequences or partial orders, and precisely control the number of expected calls.
- **Handling Uninteresting and Unexpected Calls**: Control mock strictness with `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`, balancing test robustness and verbosity.

Together, these capabilities enable interaction-based testing, meaning you verify not just state but *how* your code collaborates with its dependencies.

## Flexible Failure Handling & Verification

GoogleTest and GoogleMock ensure that test failures are precise and easy to diagnose:

- Immediate detection of expectation violations when they occur.
- Detailed failure messages showing arguments and call stack traces.
- Facilities to verify mock object expectations manually or at destruction.
- Control over verbosity to suit debugging or CI environments.

This empowers developers to identify test failures unambiguously and act decisively during test maintenance or debugging.

## Summary: What You Can Achieve

By mastering these key features, you can:

- Write scalable unit and integration tests with minimal boilerplate.
- Create mocks that remove external dependencies and make tests faster and more reliable.
- Verify code behavior both in terms of returned values and interaction patterns.
- Maintain clean, readable, and expressive tests that communicate intent clearly.

With these tools, your tests become safeguards that confidently validate code correctness and support refactoring.

## Practical Example: Mocking a Simple Interface

Imagine you have a graphics `Turtle` interface:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
  virtual void GoTo(int x, int y) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
  virtual int GetY() const = 0;
};
```

To mock this interface with GoogleMock:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

Usage in a test:

```cpp
TEST(PainterTest, DrawsCircle) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward).Times(AnyNumber());

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
}
```

If `PenDown()` is not called as expected, the test fails immediately, showing the source and call details.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Use ON_CALL and EXPECT_CALL appropriately**: Use `ON_CALL` to set default behaviors, and `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to assert a call will occur.
- **Keep expectations precise but not brittle**: Avoid over-specifying matchers to prevent fragile tests.
- **Choose mock strictness wisely**: Use `NiceMock` to suppress noise, `NaggyMock` (default) to warn, and `StrictMock` to enforce no unexpected calls.
- **Group related expectations in sequences** to test call order without over-constraining.
- **Monitor verbosity level (`--gmock_verbose`)** to balance the feedback you get during test runs.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Mock method calls invoke real methods**: Ensure mocked methods are virtual.
- **Unexpected or uninteresting calls reported**: Check your expectations; add catch-all expectations if uninteresting calls are valid.
- **Compilation issues with const parameters or overloads**: Follow GoogleMock’s macros and overload disambiguation techniques.
- **Mock leaks or missing verification**: Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to force verification if your mocks aren't being destroyed.
