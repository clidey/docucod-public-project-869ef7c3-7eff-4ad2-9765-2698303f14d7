# Core Terminology & Concepts

Understanding the fundamental terminology and concepts in GoogleTest is essential to writing effective and maintainable tests. This page unpacks key terms like **Test**, **Test Suite**, **Fixture**, **Assertion**, **Mock**, **Matcher**, and **Death Test**. Each entry provides a clear, concise explanation tailored to user intent and points to where these are implemented or commonly used in GoogleTest.

## What You Will Learn

- The differences between tests, test suites, and test fixtures
- The role and usage of assertions in verifying test conditions
- How mocks and matchers fit into test writing
- The special concept of death tests and their importance

---

## Test

A **Test** is the fundamental execution unit in GoogleTest: an individual scenario that verifies a certain behavior or property in your code.

- Each test contains assertions that check conditions.
- Tests can either pass, fail (non-fatal or fatal), be skipped, or encounter errors.
- You define tests using macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`.

**Why it Matters:** Tests are the building blocks of your verification strategy, ensuring your code works as expected in specific conditions.

**See Also:** [TEST macro](reference/testing.md#TEST), [TEST_F macro](reference/testing.md#TEST_F)

---

## Test Suite

A **Test Suite** groups multiple related tests, typically that test variations or aspects of the same class, module, or function.

- It provides a scope for shared setup and teardown routines.
- Tests in one suite share the same fixture class, if used.
- Previously called "TestCase" in older GoogleTest versions.

**Why it Matters:** Organizing tests into suites helps manage complexity and allows shared resources to be used efficiently.

**See Also:** [TestSuite class](reference/testing.md#TestSuite), [Test Fixtures section](primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests)

---

## Fixture

A **Test Fixture** is a class derived from `testing::Test` that sets up and tears down the environment for multiple tests within a suite.

- Fixtures enable sharing of objects and initialization code across tests.
- Use `TEST_F()` to define tests that use a fixture.
- Fixtures can override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for per-test preparation and cleanup.
- Also supports `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for per-suite operations.

**Practical Tip:** Use fixtures to avoid duplication and isolate test-specific logic.

**See Also:** [Test Fixtures](primer.md#same-data-multiple-tests), [TEST_F macro](reference/testing.md#TEST_F)

---

## Assertion

An **Assertion** checks a condition within a test and reports success or failure.

- Assertions come in pairs: `ASSERT_*` (fatal) and `EXPECT_*` (non-fatal).
- Fatal failures abort the current function; non-fatal allow tests to continue.
- Assertions include checks like `ASSERT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_TRUE()`, and more.

Example:
```cpp
ASSERT_EQ(value, expected) << "Custom failure message";
```

**Why it Matters:** Assertions are how tests enforce correctness and report issues.

**See Also:** [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md)

---

## Mock

A **Mock** is a simulated object that imitates the behavior of real dependencies.

- Mocks are typically created and managed through the `gMock` library.
- They allow controlled testing of interactions and side effects.
- While not covered in depth here, mocks enable verification of method calls and argument matching.

**Use Case:** Replace complex or unavailable components (e.g., databases) during tests.

---

## Matcher

A **Matcher** expresses conditions used to verify values in assertions.

- GoogleTest includes a rich matcher library for primitive and complex types.
- Example matchers: `Eq()`, `HasSubstr()`, `MatchesRegex()`, etc.
- Use with the `EXPECT_THAT()` macro for expressive tests.

**Benefit:** Makes verification more readable and flexible.

**See Also:** [Matchers Overview](reference/matchers.md), [Using GoogleMock Matchers](advanced.md#asserting-using-gmock-matchers)

---

## Death Test

A **Death Test** verifies that certain code causes the program to terminate or crash as expected.

- Executed in child processes so the main test runner continues.
- Useful for testing assertions, error handling, or fatal conditions.
- You write them with macros like `ASSERT_DEATH()` or `EXPECT_EXIT()`.
- Important: death tests run in isolated processes; side effects do not affect the parent.

**Naming Convention:** Test suites containing death tests should be named with the suffix `DeathTest`.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, CrashesOnInvalidInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(Foo(-1), "invalid input");
}
```

**See Also:** [Death Assertions](reference/assertions.md#death), [Death Tests in Advanced Guide](advanced.md#death-tests)

---

## How These Concepts Fit Together

GoogleTest's design centers on structuring tests and their execution using these concepts:

1. **Test Suites** collect logically related **Tests**.
2. **Fixtures** prepare test environments shared within test suites.
3. **Assertions** inside tests verify correctness.
4. **Matchers** enhance the expressiveness of assertions.
5. **Mocks** simulate external dependencies, often used within fixtures and tests.
6. **Death Tests** verify fatal conditions causing program termination.

Mastering these foundational concepts lets you write clear, maintainable, and powerful tests.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent naming conflicts ([see FAQ](docs/faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)).
- Use fixtures to encapsulate setup and teardown logic, ensuring tests remain independent.
- Prefer non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) to enable multiple verifications in one test; use fatal (`ASSERT_*`) assertions where continuing doesn't make sense.
- When writing death tests, be mindful that side effects inside death tests do not propagate back to the main test process.

## Next Steps

- To see these concepts applied in practice, see [Writing Your First Test](getting-started/first-tests-and-troubleshooting/writing-your-first-test).
- Learn about value-parameterized and typed tests to write more scalable test suites ([Parameterized and Typed Tests](api-reference/core-testing-interfaces/parameterized-and-typed-tests)).
- Explore advanced assertions and matcher usage in the [Expressive Assertions and Custom Matchers](guides/advanced_testing_patterns/using_matchers_assertions) guide.
