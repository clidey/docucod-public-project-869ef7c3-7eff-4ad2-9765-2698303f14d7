## Feature Highlights

| Feature              | Description                                                                                      | Key Implementation Files or Components           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Discovery**    | Automatically detects test cases and test suites using macros like `TEST` and `TEST_F`.       | `googletest/include/gtest/gtest.h`                |
| **Assertions**       | Offers an extensive set of macros (`EXPECT_*`, `ASSERT_*`) to validate test conditions easily. | `googletest/include/gtest/gtest.h`                |
| **Parameterized Tests** | Supports writing tests that run multiple times with different parameters for comprehensive coverage. | `googletest/include/gtest/gtest-param-test.h`    |
| **Death Tests**      | Enables verification that certain code paths terminate the program as expected.               | `googletest/include/gtest/gtest-death-test.h`    |
| **Mocking (GoogleMock)** | Provides flexible mocking capabilities to create mock functions and classes with expectations. | `googlemock/include/gmock/gmock.h`                |
| **Reporting**         | Configurable reporting including colored output, XML/JSON reports, and event listeners.        | Test runner and event listener APIs in `gtest_main` and related modules |

## 1. Test Discovery
GoogleTest uses a declarative approach where you define tests via macros like `TEST()` and `TEST_F()`. These macros register tests automatically at runtime, allowing the framework to discover tests without manual registration.

### Why It Matters
- Seamless integration: You write tests in C++ source files, and GoogleTest runs all available tests without extra configuration.
- Supports nested test fixtures for reusable setup and teardown logic.

---

## 2. Assertions
Assertions validate the correctness of code under test. GoogleTest provides:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**: Abort the current test on failure.
- **Non-Fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**: Record failure but continue executing the test.

### Benefits
- Clear, expressive macros covering equality, relational conditions, strings, exceptions, and many more.
- Custom failure messages to aid debugging.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(MyTestSuite, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(4, Add(2, 2));
  ASSERT_TRUE(IsValid());
}
```

---

## 3. Parameterized Tests
Avoid duplicate code by writing a test once and running it with multiple data values.

### How It Works
- Define a test fixture derived from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`.
- Use the `TEST_P` macro to write parameterized tests.
- Instantiate tests with specific parameter sets using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### User Benefit
- Scales coverage without copy-pasting.
- Makes data-driven testing straightforward.

---

## 4. Death Tests
Validate that your program terminates under certain conditions, such as when triggering fatal assertions or checking invalid states.

### Key Points
- Use macros like `ASSERT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_DEATH`, `ASSERT_EXIT`.
- Capture and verify termination signals, exit codes, and output.
- Supports threaded and multi-process considerations.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(DeathTest, Termination) {
  ASSERT_DEATH(SomeFunctionThatShouldExit(), "error message");
}
```

---

## 5. Mocking with GoogleMock
GoogleTest integrates closely with GoogleMock for powerful mocking capabilities.

### Features
- Mock classes and functions with `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Set expectations on mock calls.
- Use argument matchers for flexible call validation.
- Inject mocks to isolate units under test.

### Practical Use
- Simplifies testing of interfaces and collaborations between components.
- Provides detailed diagnostics on unexpected calls or call counts.

## 6. Reporting & Test Lifecycle Control
GoogleTest offers varied output and control:

- Terminal color coding for immediate feedback.
- XML and JSON outputs for integrating with CI systems.
- Event Listeners API to customize test report generation or trigger actions.
- Command line flags for filtering, sharding, repetition, and randomization.

---

## Mapping to Source and Configuration
- Core macros and test declarations reside primarily in `googletest/include/gtest/gtest.h`.
- Parameterized test support is in `googletest/include/gtest/gtest-param-test.h`.
- Death testing APIs can be found in `googletest/include/gtest/gtest-death-test.h`.
- Mocking features are provided via `googlemock/include/gmock/gmock.h`.
- Build and configuration files such as `CMakeLists.txt` and `BUILD.bazel` enable integrating GoogleTest into various build systems.

---

## Tips for Success
- Start with simple `TEST` and `ASSERT_*` macros to gain confidence.
- Use parameterized tests to maximize coverage with minimal code.
- Isolate dependencies with GoogleMock to test complex interactions.
- Leverage death tests to ensure robust failure handling.
- Customize reporting to fit your CI or local testing workflow.

## Troubleshooting
- If tests are not discovered, verify that macros are properly used and source files included.
- Ensure your build system compiles GoogleTest with the correct C++ standard (C++17 or later).
- For flaky death tests, explore the `death_test_style` flag.
