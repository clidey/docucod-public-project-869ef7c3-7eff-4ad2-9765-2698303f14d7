# Core Concepts & Terminology

Welcome to the foundational guide that defines the essential terms and concepts you need to master GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively. This page clarifies the core building blocks of the framework, ensuring you fully understand the vocabulary before diving deeper into usage and advanced features.

---

## Why This Matters

Understanding these key terms upfront will empower you to read documentation, write tests, and communicate clearly within your team. Each concept reflects a vital piece of GoogleTest's testing and mocking ecosystem — grasping them ensures your testing workflow is smooth, effective, and maintainable.

---

## Essential Terms Defined

### Test Case and Test Suite
A **Test Case** or **Test Suite** groups together logically related tests. It is typically a collection of tests verifying a single component or functionality. In GoogleTest, the terms are used interchangeably, although “test suite” is more common in modern testing parlance.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathOperations, Addition) { ... }
TEST(MathOperations, Subtraction) { ... }
```
Here, `MathOperations` is the test suite containing multiple tests.

---

### Test Fixture
A **Test Fixture** provides a common setup and teardown environment for a collection of tests, allowing you to share code and manage resources cleanly and efficiently across tests.

- Defined as a class derived from `::testing::Test`.
- You write per-test setup logic in `SetUp()` and teardown logic in `TearDown()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Connect to the test database
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Disconnect and clean up
  }
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertRecord) { ... }
``` 

### Assertion
Assertions are statements in tests that check if specific conditions hold true. They are the core of validating behavior in GoogleTest.

- `EXPECT_*` assertions continue the test even if they fail.
- `ASSERT_*` assertions abort the current test immediately upon failure.

Common examples include:
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` — checks equality
- `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` — checks a boolean condition

### Matcher
A **Matcher** is a reusable object that defines criteria to test whether a value meets certain expectations. Matchers provide flexible, expressive ways to state expectations, especially when used with GoogleMock.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(value, ::testing::MatchesRegex("\\d+"));
```

Matchers simplify complex argument validations and improve test readability.

---

### Mock
Mocks are fake objects that imitate real objects’ behavior for testing purposes. GoogleMock provides:
- Declarative syntax for defining mock classes.
- Automatic verification of method calls.
- Rich expectation definitions and argument matching.

Mocks help isolate units under test and simulate complex dependencies.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MockDatabase : public Database {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Connect, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Insert, (const Record&), (override));
};

MockDatabase mock_db;
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1);
```

---

### Action
Actions define what a mock method does when called. They let you specify:
- Return values
- Side effects
- Throws or invokes callbacks

These replace the behavior of real functions, enabling fine control in tests.

**Example:**
```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_db, Insert).WillByDefault(Return(true));
EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Insert).WillOnce(Invoke([](const Record& rec) {
  // Custom logic on insert
  return true;
}));
```

---

### Death Test
A **Death Test** verifies that a program terminates in a specific and controlled manner (usually crashes or calls `exit`) under certain conditions.

- Run in a separate process to avoid crashing the main test runner.
- Useful for testing assertion failures or fatal errors.

**Example:**
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH({ DoDangerousOperation(); }, "Fatal error detected");
```
---

## How These Terms Fit Together

This terminology forms the backbone of understanding GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- You write **Test Suites (Cases)** organizing logic related tests.
- Use **Test Fixtures** to manage shared contexts and reduce redundancy.
- Guard your test expectations with **Assertions**.
- Employ **Matchers** for expressive validation.
- Create **Mocks** and define their **Actions** to isolate and verify interactions.
- Use **Death Tests** to ensure code behaves correctly in error and termination cases.

This synthesis makes your tests clear, readable, maintainable, and powerful.

<Tip>
Always name your test suites and tests clearly, avoiding underscores to prevent issues referenced in the [FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/faq).
</Tip>

<Note>
You cannot use assertions in constructors or destructors of fixtures; use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` instead to ensure proper error handling.
