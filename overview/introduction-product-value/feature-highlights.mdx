# Key Features at a Glance

Welcome to an at-a-glance look at GoogleTest's essential capabilitiesâ€”the C++ testing framework that simplifies writing, running, and maintaining automated tests with confidence and clarity.

## Seamless Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers all your test cases and test suites across your entire project without manual registration. This out-of-the-box capability lets you:* Concentrate on writing tests, not listing or managing them.* Run your test program to execute all tests instantly, whether they are simple, parameterized, or typed.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, ComputesFactorial) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}
```
Without additional setup, this test is automatically detected and executed by GoogleTest.

## Rich and Expressive Assertions

GoogleTest offers a broad range of assertion macros supporting:

- **Basic Conditions:** `EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_FALSE`
- **Equality and Inequality:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`
- **Relational Comparisons:** `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE`
- **String Comparisons:** `EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_STRNE`
- **Floating-Point Comparisons:** `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`
- **Predicate and Matcher Assertions:** `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for complex validation.

When assertions fail, GoogleTest provides detailed, easy-to-understand error messages, showing actual and expected values, making fixes straightforward.

Example of expressive assertion with matchers:
```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(my_string, StartsWith("Hello"));
```

## Support for Parameterized and Typed Tests

Testing a range of input values or template types is simple with:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic over multiple input values seamlessly.
- **Typed Tests:** Apply the same test logic to various types, ensuring interface or behavior consistency.

This enables broad coverage with minimal code duplication and easy extension.

Example:
```cpp
class PrimeTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(PrimeTest, IsPrime) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(n));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PrimeNumbers, PrimeTest, ::testing::Values(2,3,5,7,11));
```

## Configurable Failure Severity and Flow Control

GoogleTest distinguishes between **nonfatal** (`EXPECT_`) assertions that allow tests to continue, and **fatal** (`ASSERT_`) assertions that abort the current test function. This fine-grained control lets you tailor tests for robustness and precision.

- Use **`ASSERT_*`** when subsequent code depends on a condition to hold, preventing crashes.
- Use **`EXPECT_*`** to report errors but continue testing for other issues.

## Integration with Modern Toolchains and Platforms

Designed for portability, GoogleTest compiles cleanly with modern C++17 environments and integrates smoothly with popular build systems like CMake. It supports Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms, adapting to various compilers and configurations.

Additionally, it supports:
- Colored terminal output for clearer test results
- XML and JSON report generation for CI integration
- Thread-safe death tests with configurable styles

## Why GoogleTest Matters

GoogleTest removes boilerplate from testing, encourages well-structured and maintainable tests, and makes diagnosing failures effortless. It empowers developers to catch bugs early, verify complex logic, and ensure continuous quality across codebases of all sizes.
