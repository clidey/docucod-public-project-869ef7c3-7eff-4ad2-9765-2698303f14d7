# Supported Platforms & Compatibility

## Ensuring Your Environment is Ready for GoogleTest

GoogleTest strictly adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), providing robust testing support on officially supported platforms and compilers. This page outlines precisely which platforms, compilers, and build tools are supported, helping you prepare your development environment for reliable test integration.

### Why This Matters

Before integrating GoogleTest, you need assurance that your environment can fully support it. Supported platforms ensure compatibility with core features like multithreading, exception handling, and filesystem access, which underpin GoogleTest’s rich testing capabilities. Understanding compatibility upfront helps you avoid unexpected build errors or runtime issues.

## Officially Supported Platforms, Compilers, and Build Tools

GoogleTest’s support is directly aligned with the platforms and compilers covered by Google’s foundational C++ support matrix. This matrix is actively maintained to reflect the latest compatibility information:

- **Platforms:** Linux distributions, Windows (Desktop/MinGW), macOS, and select BSDs among others.
- **Compilers:** Mainstream C++ compilers such as GCC, Clang, MSVC, IntelLLVM, and others meeting C++17 standards.
- **Build Tools:** CMake is the primary supported build system, with pkg-config files included for ease of integration.

The latest detailed breakdown can be found in the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

<Tip>
Regularly reviewing the support matrix ensures your environment remains compatible as GoogleTest and its dependencies evolve.

## Compiler and Platform Support Details

GoogleTest requires a **minimum of C++17 support** from your compiler. This baseline guarantees modern language features and library capabilities critical for GoogleTest’s performance and functionality.

### Platform Detection

GoogleTest automatically detects your operating system using predefined macros such as `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and others. This enables it to apply platform-specific implementations where necessary, such as thread synchronization, file system operations, and exception handling.

### Threading and Synchronization

Thread safety in GoogleTest depends on the underlying platform’s threading capabilities. Most supported platforms provide:

- **POSIX threads (pthreads):** Used on Unix-like platforms.
- **Windows threading primitives:** Used on Windows platforms.

If threading support is lacking or disabled, GoogleTest gracefully compiles with a dummy implementation, but testing multi-threaded code or thread-safe test execution is not available.

### Exception and RTTI Support

GoogleTest expects exception support (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) and runtime type information (`GTEST_HAS_RTTI`) to be enabled. These are required for certain assertions and dynamic type-related features.

### Regular Expression Engine

To support its powerful assertion messages and filtering abilities, GoogleTest uses one of the following:

- **Abseil’s RE2:** Preferred if Abseil is present.
- **POSIX Regex:** Used on compatible POSIX platforms.
- **Simple Regex:** A fallback simple regex implementation on unsupported platforms.

## Supported Build System Integration

GoogleTest includes build integration support primarily through CMake and pkg-config. These advanced configurations ease compiling and linking while maintaining portability.

### Using CMake

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) supporting various platforms. Building GoogleTest with CMake ensures:

- Automatic detection of threading support and compiler capabilities.
- Proper setting of compiler flags for exceptions, RTTI, and language standard.
- Support for building static or shared libraries.

#### Sample Standalone Build Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git -b main
dkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # Add -DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF if you want only GoogleTest.
make
sudo make install # Installs libraries and headers.
```

### Using pkg-config

Pkg-config files for GoogleTest are distributed to help other build systems determine compiler and linker flags.

When using pkg-config, it provides the necessary include paths, macro definitions (e.g., `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`), required libraries (e.g., `-lgtest`, `-lpthread`), and link paths.

```bash
pkg-config --cflags gtest
pkg-config --libs gtest
```

This is essential when integrating GoogleTest in complex or cross-compilation environments.

<Tip>
If pkg-config cannot find GoogleTest, ensure the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable points to the location where GoogleTest’s `.pc` files are installed.
</Tip>

## Environment Readiness and Constraints

### Minimum C++ Standard

- **C++17 is required.** GoogleTest enforces this to leverage modern features and maintain consistent behavior.

### Platform Prerequisites

- **Filesystem Access:** Needed for some test functionalities such as temporary file handling and death tests.
- **Thread Support:** Preferred for thread-safe test execution.
- **Exception and RTTI Support:** Required for complete feature compatibility.

### Platform Limitations

On some embedded or mobile platforms without standard OS services (e.g., Windows Mobile, ESP8266), GoogleTest disables features like stream redirection and death tests.

## Where to Check for the Latest Compatibility Information

Since platform and compiler support can evolve, GoogleTest’s supported platforms are continuously updated externally:

- [Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
- [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

Referencing these ensures you align your development environment with GoogleTest’s tested configurations.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Confirm C++17 Support:** Verify your compiler honors at least C++17 standard.
- **Use CMake or pkg-config:** These tools simplify integration and reduce platform incompatibility risks.
- **Check Threading Flags:** If necessary, explicitly enable or disable pthread support via compiler flags (`-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `=0`) to match your environment.
- **For Cross-Compilation:** Set `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` and related environment variables to ensure search paths remain correct.

## Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Compatibility Concerns">
<Accordion title="Compiler version too low or C++ standard not supported">
Ensure your compiler version supports C++17. For GCC, Clang, MSVC, or Intel compilers, check documentation for minimum versions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pkg-config can’t find GoogleTest">
Verify your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes the directory containing `.pc` files from GoogleTest install.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Threading support detection fails">
Force enable or disable pthread support with `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` in compiler flags, depending on your environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Death tests fail or not supported">
Death tests require filesystem and process control features; avoid on embedded/mobile platforms lacking these.
</Accordion>
