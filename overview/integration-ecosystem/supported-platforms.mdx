# Supported Platforms & Requirements

GoogleTest is designed to offer a comprehensive and reliable testing framework for C++ applications across a wide range of platforms and compiler configurations. This page outlines the officially supported operating systems, compilers, and C++ standard requirements necessary to use GoogleTest effectively.

---

## Why Platform & Compiler Support Matters

Choosing the right testing framework depends not just on features, but also on compatibility and ease of integration within your development environment. GoogleTest follows Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), ensuring ongoing compatibility with mainstream platforms, compilers, and tools. This guarantees that your tests will build and run reliably without unexpected platform-specific issues.

Understanding supported environments helps you avoid build failures, runtime anomalies, and debugger incompatibilities that arise from mismatched toolchains or unsupported C++ standard versions.

## Officially Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

GoogleTest provides stable support on the following major platforms:

- **Linux**: All popular distributions supporting the required compiler standards
- **Mac OS X (macOS)**: Including both desktop and iOS targets
- **Windows**: Covers Windows Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, and Windows Store (WinRT) platforms
- **FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD**: BSD variants supported for Unix-like compatibility
- **Others**: Includes Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and select embedded systems such as ESP32 and ESP8266

While GoogleTest detects these platforms automatically, and defines macros like `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP`, or `GTEST_OS_MAC` accordingly, users can override detection if necessary for custom environments.

For the complete and up-to-date enumeration of supported platforms, consult the [Supported Platforms table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

## Supported Compilers and C++ Standards

GoogleTest requires a compiler that supports at least the **C++17** standard, ensuring usage of modern language features and preventing compatibility issues.

Supported compilers include:

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** Version with C++17 support (typically GCC 7.0 and above)
- **Clang:** Version with C++17 support
- **Microsoft Visual C++:** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11) or newer
- **Intel C++ Compiler:** Compatible with C++17

The GoogleTest build system (CMake and Bazel) includes checks to enforce minimal C++ language standard versions.

Users targeting older compilers or standards will need to upgrade or adjust their build environment accordingly.

---

## Threading and Platform Features

GoogleTest automatically detects and conditionally enables platform-specific threading and feature capabilities:

- **Thread Safety:** Enabled if POSIX pthread library or equivalent Windows threading APIs are available. You can verify thread safety with the `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro.
- **Exception Handling:** Detected and enabled based on your compiler and build flags, influencing test behavior and assertion handling.
- **RTTI (Run Time Type Information):** Utilized when available to enrich typed tests and casting utilities.
- **Regular Expression Support:** Selects from RE2 (when Abseil is available), POSIX regex, or a built-in simple regex fallback.

These internal flags ensure GoogleTest functions optimally on each platform and help you tailor test builds if needed.

---

## Configuring the Build for Your Platform

To harness GoogleTest’s platform support efficiently:

- Use the [official CMake build scripts](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/CMakeLists.txt), which automatically detect and configure platform-specific options.
- For Bazel users, the provided [`BUILD.bazel` file](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/BUILD.bazel) contains platform configuration macros.
- Customize compiler flags and feature toggles in your build scripts as necessary, following GoogleTest's portable defaults.

For embedded platforms or unusual environments, you may need to manually define macros to control feature detection or platform options.

---

## Practical Tips

- **Verify Your Compiler Version:** Before integrating GoogleTest, ensure your compiler version supports at least C++17.
- **Check Platform Macros:** Use platform macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS` or `GTEST_OS_LINUX` in your code when you need conditional behavior.
- **Threading Configuration:** If your environment lacks pthread support but you need thread safety, confirm the availability of Windows threading or define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` when applicable.
- **Avoid Mixing CRT Linkage on Windows:** Match your project runtime library (dynamic/static) with GoogleTest’s settings to avoid linker errors.

## Troubleshooting Common Compatibility Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform Compatibility Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Build Errors Related to C++ Standard">
If your build fails with errors mentioning unsupported features or keywords, check your compiler’s C++ standard setting. GoogleTest requires at least C++17. Update your compiler or build flags (e.g., `-std=c++17` in GCC/Clang or set C++ language version in Visual Studio).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows Regarding Runtime Libraries">
If you see linker errors due to mismatched C runtime libraries (e.g., mismatch between MT and MD runtime), make sure to synchronize runtime library settings between your project and GoogleTest. The CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` can help by adjusting GoogleTest to use dynamic CRT.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing pthread Symbols on Unix-Like Systems">
For systems without full pthread support, use the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` flag if threading is not needed. If threading is needed, ensure pthread libraries are installed and linked correctly.
