# Who Should Use GoogleTest?

GoogleTest is purpose-built to deliver reliable, maintainable, and efficient C++ testing for a wide range of users. This page outlines which primary user groups will find GoogleTest indispensable, focusing on how it helps them achieve high-quality code through automated testing workflows.

---

## Target Users of GoogleTest

### C++ Developers

If you write C++ code, GoogleTest is your go-to framework for embedded automated tests. Whether you work on libraries, applications, or system code, GoogleTest makes it easy to write robust tests that verify your code’s behavior precisely and reliably.

- **Write tests that catch bugs early** by defining clear test cases using familiar macros.
- **Gain confidence in your code** through automated, repeatable validation.
- **Leverage rich assertion macros** designed specifically for C++ types.

Example: As a developer, you want to ensure your sorting algorithm correctly sorts lists of integers and strings. GoogleTest lets you express these tests clearly and run them automatically on every build.

### QA Engineers

Quality Assurance engineers benefit from GoogleTest by integrating it into continuous integration (CI) pipelines, enabling fast and comprehensive test coverage.

- **Automate regression testing** effortlessly.
- **Interpret test results clearly** with detailed failure reports.
- **Reduce manual testing effort** with repeatable test execution.

Scenario: QA can run your GoogleTest suite on multiple platforms and compilers, verifying that bugs are fixed across all target environments.

### Open Source Project Maintainers

Maintainers of open source C++ projects rely on GoogleTest to enforce code quality and to encourage contributions that pass defined quality gates.

- **Ensure contributions meet standards** with pre-configured test suites.
- **Facilitate onboarding** by providing a well-structured testing framework.
- **Maintain test portability** across different platforms and compilers.

For example, an open source maintainers’ CI system runs GoogleTest to validate pull requests before integration, reducing the risk of regressions.

### Teams Focused on Maintainable Code

Teams aiming to keep their codebases healthy over time need automated tests deeply integrated into their development workflow.

- **Catch regressions quickly** during development.
- **Document expected behavior** through clear, executable specifications.
- **Encourage a test-driven development (TDD) style** with GoogleTest’s simple yet powerful APIs.

Illustration: A team working on a complex C++ service uses GoogleTest to continuously validate multiple modules, ensuring that refactoring does not create silent bugs.

## Why These Users Should Care

GoogleTest directly addresses the needs of these user groups by:

- Delivering a **comprehensive C++ testing framework** compatible with modern C++ standards.
- Supporting **automated test discovery**, saving setup and maintenance time.
- Enabling **parameterized and typed tests**, allowing scalable and reusable test definitions.
- Providing **extensibility** with features like mocking through gMock (bundled with GoogleTest).

Together, these capabilities help users accelerate development cycles, improve code quality, and maintain software confidently over time.

---

## Best Practices for These Users

- **Start small:** Begin by writing simple tests for critical functions.
- **Incrementally integrate:** Add tests alongside feature development and bug fixes.
- **Use fixtures and parameterized tests:** Reuse setup code and test multiple inputs efficiently.
- **Leverage mocking (gMock) when needed:** Isolate units by mocking dependencies.
- **Integrate GoogleTest into your build and CI pipelines:** Run tests automatically to catch issues fast.

### Example Workflow (For a C++ Developer):

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Up GoogleTest in Your Project">
Add GoogleTest to your build system (e.g., CMake). Configure your test targets.
</Step>
<Step title="Write Your First Test">
Define a test case using `TEST()` macros that verifies a class or function’s behavior.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Tests Regularly">
Run tests locally and integrate with CI to ensure no regressions.
</Step>
<Step title="Expand Coverage with Fixtures and Parameterized Tests">
Group related tests and test multiple input sets efficiently.
</Step>
<Step title="Use gMock to Isolate Dependencies">
For complex modules, mock collaborators to test behavior independently.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

### Additional Examples

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Sample function to be tested
int Add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

TEST(MathTest, AddPositive) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST(MathTest, AddNegative) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(-1, -1), -2);
}
```

---

### Tips

- Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` over `ASSERT_*` when possible to allow further test execution.
- Integrate GoogleTest with your IDE or editors for seamless test running and debugging.
