# Feature Overview

## Unlocking the Power of GoogleTest's Core Features

Welcome to the Feature Overview—a quick yet actionable guide to the main capabilities of the GoogleTest framework that transform your C++ testing experience. Here, you will discover the essential features that empower you to write clean, maintainable, and reliable tests for your codebase.

Whether you're a developer aiming to validate logic, a tester looking to automate verification, or a team focused on quality assurance, this overview connects features to practical needs.

### Key Features at a Glance

- **Automatic Test Discovery**: No manual registration required. Write your test cases, and GoogleTest discovers and runs them for you.
- **Powerful Assertions**: Expressive macros verify conditions clearly; failure reports are rich and informative.
- **Mocking Support via GoogleMock**: Seamlessly create mock classes to simulate dependencies, verify interactions, and control behavior.
- **Death Tests**: Validate that the code properly handles fatal errors or abnormal terminations.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Write a test once, run it with multiple input values and types automatically.
- **Flexible Test Runners**: Customize how tests execute, filter execution, and integrate smoothly with CI pipelines.

## What You Need to Know: Features Explained

### Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest scans your test binaries to find all defined test cases using `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros. This eliminates manual test lists and ensures that adding new tests is frictionless.

**Benefit:** You spend zero time maintaining test registrations and get instant feedback on new test coverage.


### Assertions: Making Validation Clear and Robust

GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertion macros to check conditions. Common forms include:

- `EXPECT_*` for non-fatal checks allowing tests to continue
- `ASSERT_*` for fatal checks that abort the current function

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value);
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr);
```

Assertions help you pinpoint failures with clear messages, line information, and context.

**Best Practice:** Use `EXPECT_*` when continuing tests makes sense; use `ASSERT_*` to stop tests early when preconditions fail.

### Mocking with GoogleMock

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest by allowing you to create mock implementations of your interfaces effortlessly. You can:

- Define mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD` macros that simulate real behavior.
- Set expectations on method calls, arguments, ordering, and call counts using `EXPECT_CALL`.
- Customize return values, side effects, and actions to simulate complex scenarios.
- Use strict, nice, or naggy mock variants to control uninteresting call warnings and test strictness.

**Use Case:** Isolate components under test by mocking out dependencies, ensuring your tests focus on specific interaction contracts.

Example:

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(void, DoThis, (), (override));
};

MockFoo mock;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThis());
... code that uses mock ...
```

---

### Death Tests

Death tests verify that your code exits or terminates as expected in critical failure scenarios.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EXIT(FuncThatCrashes(), ::testing::KilledBySignal(SIGABRT), "error message");
```

This ensures your code correctly handles fatal errors, enhancing robustness.

---

### Parameterized Tests

Reduce code duplication by running the same test logic against multiple inputs:

- Define a test template using `TEST_P`.
- Provide different input sets using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

Example:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, DoesSomething) {
  int input = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(Process(input));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Values, MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This way, your tests stay concise and comprehensive.

---

### Flexible Test Runners

GoogleTest offers command-line flags and options for filtering which tests to run, controlling output verbosity, and integrating with IDEs and CI tools. You can:

- Filter tests by name or suite.
- Repeat tests.
- Shuffle test order to detect hidden dependencies.
- Control output formats (XML, JSON).
- Adjust logging verbosity for detailed diagnostics.


## Why Should You Care?

Leveraging these features directly translates to:

- Faster development and debugging with automatic test discovery.
- Clear failure diagnostics that speed up fixing bugs.
- More expressive and maintainable test code.
- Better control of test behavior with mocks and parameterization.
- Confidence that error handling works correctly with death tests.
- Easy integration into your team's workflows.

In short, GoogleTest equips you with a powerful toolbox to deliver quality at speed.
