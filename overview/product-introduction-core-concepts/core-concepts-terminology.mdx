# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understanding the foundational concepts and vocabulary of GoogleTest is essential to mastering effective testing in C++. This page introduces the key terms and ideas that form the backbone of GoogleTest, helping individuals and teams speak a common language and apply the framework with confidence.

## Defining the Building Blocks of GoogleTest

### What Is xUnit?

xUnit is a family of testing frameworks that follow a common architecture. GoogleTest is part of this lineage, designed for C++. It provides a structured approach to writing and organizing tests, enabling automation and repeatable verification of code behavior.

### Test Fixture

A **test fixture** sets up the common environment needed for multiple tests. It allows you to initialize data, configure state, and clean up resources so that each test starts with a known, controlled context. This prevents duplication and improves test reliability.

**Example Scenario:** Imagine you are testing a database client. Instead of writing connection setup and teardown in every test, you encapsulate this logic in a test fixture, which runs before and after each test.

---

### Mock

A **mock** is a simulated object that mimics the behavior of real collaborators in your system for testing purposes. With GoogleMock (integrated in GoogleTest), you can:

- Specify which methods should be called
- Define expected arguments
- Inject return values or side effects
- Verify interaction patterns

Mocking helps isolate code under test, making your tests faster, more deterministic, and easier to understand.

---

### Assertion

An **assertion** verifies a condition during test execution. GoogleTest provides many assertion macros like `EXPECT_EQ()`, `ASSERT_TRUE()`, and `EXPECT_THAT()` to verify values, conditions, and matcher expressions.

- **EXPECT_** assertions continue the test upon failure (non-fatal failure).
- **ASSERT_** assertions stop the test immediately upon failure (fatal failure).

Assertions provide clear, actionable feedback about failures, including file locations and custom messages.

---

### Death Test

A **death test** validates that a piece of code causes the program to terminate safely and as expected (e.g., fatal errors, assertions).

You write death tests using `EXPECT_DEATH()` macros, specifying the code that should die and the stderr output it should produce.

Death tests help ensure that invalid states and fatal error conditions are properly handled.

---

### Parameterized Testing

**Parameterized tests** allow running the same test logic across multiple sets of data without repetition.

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests to:

- Run tests with different input values
- Use typed or type-parameterized tests for generic verification

This approach promotes thorough coverage and reduces boilerplate.

**Example:** Testing a function with various inputs instead of writing separate tests for each.

---

## Practical User Flows

### Using a Test Fixture

1. Define a test fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.
2. Initialize common state in the constructor or `SetUp()` method.
3. Write tests using `TEST_F()` that access the fixture.
4. Clean up in destructor or `TearDown()`.

This flow ensures each test runs with a consistent environment.

### Writing Mocks

1. Define interfaces (abstract classes).
2. Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to implement mock methods in subclasses.
3. In tests, create mock objects and specify behaviors/expectations.
4. Exercise code that uses mocks and verify interactions.

This flow tests integration points and side effects with precision.

### Writing Assertions

- Use expressive macros like `EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected)` for clarity.
- Add custom messages to explain failures.
- Use matchers with `EXPECT_THAT()` for advanced validation.

Assertions focus on what the user wants to verifyâ€”the correctness of behavior.

### Writing Death Tests

- Wrap code expected to terminate inside `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, "matcher")`.
- Use regular expressions to verify error messages.
- Confirm the program handles fatal errors as designed.

Death tests validate robustness under failure conditions.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always set expectations on mocks *before* exercising code to avoid undefined behavior.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls when you don't need strict verification.
- For strict guarantees, use `StrictMock` which treats unexpected calls as errors.
- Prefer parameterized tests for repetitive logic to keep tests maintainable and concise.
- Use `ASSERT_` assertions when continuing after failure would cause undefined behavior.

## Summary Example

```cpp
// Example of using a test fixture with assertions and mocking

class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  MockDatabase db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, ReturnsCorrectRecordCount) {
  EXPECT_CALL(db, GetRecordCount())
      .WillOnce(Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(db.GetRecordCount(), 42);
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Undefined Behavior Warning:** Set up your expectations prior to invoking mocks.
- **Excessive Log Warnings:** Consider wrapping mocks in `NiceMock` to reduce noise.
- **Unexpected Mock Calls:** Ensure all used mock methods have expectations or default actions.
- **Death Tests Always Fail:** Double-check the death condition and regex matcher correctness.
