# Feature Overview

## Get a Snapshot of GoogleTest's Core Testing Features

GoogleTest equips C++ developers with a comprehensive suite of testing capabilities designed to streamline and enhance the quality assurance process. This overview introduces key functionalities—such as automatic test discovery, expressive assertions, advanced parameterized tests, death testing, test execution ordering, and parallel test running—each essential to crafting robust and maintainable test suites.

Explore each feature with concise explanations and pointers on how to deepen your understanding.

### Automatic Test Discovery

*GoogleTest eliminates the manual overhead of registering and managing tests.*

By simply defining test cases with the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros, GoogleTest automatically discovers and runs them. This means your focus can remain squarely on writing tests rather than organizing or registering them.

This seamless discovery supports straightforward scalability as projects grow.

### Expressive Assertions

*Verify code behavior precisely and clearly.*

GoogleTest provides a rich collection of assertions (like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc.) that express the expected conditions in your tests.

You can write both fatal (`ASSERT_`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_`) assertions depending on whether test execution should halt on failure or continue.

This flexibility enables thorough and informative verification.

### User-Defined Assertions

*Tailor assertions to your domain and code base.*

If existing assertions don’t fully fit your needs, GoogleTest allows you to define your own custom assertions returning [`AssertionResult`](../reference/testing.md#AssertionResult) objects.

This capability strengthens tests by capturing domain-specific logic and providing clear failure messages.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

*Write once, test multiple input values effortlessly.*

GoogleTest supports defining tests that run multiple times with different values. Using `TEST_P` alongside `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`, you can execute the same logic across a range or list of parameters.

Example:
```cpp
class MyTestSuite : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTestSuite, HandlesValues) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, MyTestSuite, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This saves code duplication and boosts coverage.

### Type-Parameterized Tests

*Test your code across different types with ease.*

Using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`, you can define template-based test fixtures and run tests instantiated over a list of types.

Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public ::testing::Test {
  // Use T inside this fixture
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, DoesSomething) {
  TypeParam val = ...; // TypeParam is int or double
  EXPECT_TRUE(val >= 0);
}
```

This is perfect for generic libraries and template-heavy code.

### Death Testing

*Confidently test code that must crash or exit.*

GoogleTest facilitates death tests, which verify that code under test properly aborts under invalid conditions.

For example, you can check whether function execution causes a program termination or throws a fatal error.

Death tests ensure robustness, especially in safety-critical or error-sensitive code paths.

### Test Ordering

*Specify the order your tests run when required.*

Though tests ideally run independently in any order, sometimes strict sequencing is necessary. GoogleTest lets you enforce order by using `Sequence` objects or `InSequence` blocks to describe expectations on the order of mock calls or test execution.

Example of an ordered mock call sequence:
```cpp
using ::testing::Sequence;
Sequence seq;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall()).InSequence(seq);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall()).InSequence(seq);
```

This feature helps in testing complex interactions and phased setups.

### Parallel Test Execution

*Speed up test runs by leveraging concurrency.*

GoogleTest supports parallel execution of tests to significantly reduce testing time on multiprocessor or multicore systems.

Though parallel running isn’t enabled by default, tools like `gtest-parallel` (a separate utility) come recommended to harness this capability.

You can test large codebases efficiently while retaining full coverage.

## Where to Learn More

Each feature summarized here has detailed documentation to guide you:

- **Assertions**: [Assertions Reference](../reference/testing.md#Macros) explains different assertion macros and their usage.
- **Parameterized Tests**: [Value-Parameterized Tests](../advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) and [Typed Tests](../advanced.md#typed-tests) provide deep dives into writing and managing parameterized cases.
- **Death Tests**: [Advanced Death Tests](../advanced.md#death-tests) explore best practices in writing death tests.
- **Mocking and Ordering**: Mocking documentation ([Basics](../guides/mocking-best-practices/basics-of-mocking), [Actions & Matchers](../concepts/mocking-essentials/expectations-matchers-actions)) covers how test ordering works in expectations.
- **Parallel Testing**: Explore external tools like [`gtest-parallel`](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) that integrate smoothly with GoogleTest.
