# Key Features Overview

Welcome to the concise summary of **GoogleTest's headline features**, designed to empower you with a robust, flexible, and expressive C++ testing framework. This page highlights the core capabilities you’ll rely on to write maintainable, efficient, and comprehensive tests for your software projects.

## xUnit Architecture: The Foundation for Organized Testing
GoogleTest adheres to the widely adopted xUnit architecture, structuring tests into suites and cases for clarity and reuse. This foundation enables you to:

- Organize tests logically into **test suites** and **test cases**.
- Manage setup and teardown processes with fixtures, keeping your test code clean and consistent.
- Ensure each test runs independently, which isolates failures and boosts confidence.

Explore more about this in the [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/core-concepts-architecture/core-concepts-terminology).

## Automatic Test Discovery: Zero Configuration, Maximum Convenience
Stop worrying about registering your tests manually. GoogleTest automatically discovers:

- All your defined tests following the `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros.
- Typed and parameterized tests as well.

This means your tests run as soon as you build and execute your test binary—streamlining your workflow dramatically.

## Rich Assertions: Express More, Debug Faster
GoogleTest provides a comprehensive set of assertions to capture various test verifications:

- Equality, inequality, and relational operators.
- Exception and death assertions enabling robust error condition tests.
- Predicate assertions that supply better diagnostics.
- [Advanced matchers](reference/assertions.html#EXPECT_THAT) enable expressive conditions, improving readability and failure reporting.

Use assertions to write clear expectations and gain precise insight when tests fail.

## Parametrized and Typed Tests: Scale Your Test Coverage Effortlessly
Harness powerful test patterns with:

- **Parameterized tests** allow running the same test logic with different inputs.
- **Typed tests** enable running tests across various types without rewriting code.

This lets you cover more scenarios with less boilerplate, increasing test coverage and reliability.

Dive into detailed usage in [Parameterized and Typed Tests](/guides/practical-testing-patterns/parameterized-testing).

## Death Tests: Validating Crash and Exit Behavior Safely
GoogleTest lets you write tests to confirm your code crashes or exits as expected under error conditions:

- Support both *fast* and *threadsafe* death test styles to match your threading environment.
- Run death tests in isolated subprocesses to prevent test suite crashes.
- Write expressive death assertions to check error messages and exit kinds.

Read more in [Death Tests: Testing Code That Should Crash or Exit](/guides/practical-testing-patterns/death-tests).

## Flexible Test Execution Options: Control and Customize Your Test Runs
GoogleTest provides commands and flags to tailor your test execution:

- Filter which tests run with flexible wildcard support.
- Repeat and shuffle tests for robustness.
- Manage mock behavior strictness to balance test maintenance and verification.

Control your tool to fit your workflow and testing strategies seamlessly.
