# Supported Platforms & Integration Points

## Unlocking GoogleTest’s Broad Compatibility and Seamless Integration

GoogleTest stands out by offering robust support across a wide range of platforms, compilers, and build systems, empowering C++ developers to write and maintain high-quality tests in virtually any environment. This page explores the environments GoogleTest supports, how to integrate it smoothly into your build configurations, and highlights notable open-source projects that trust GoogleTest for their testing needs.

### Why Master Supported Platforms and Integration Points?

When starting to use GoogleTest, understanding where it works and how it fits into your build system unlocks your ability to quickly and reliably add testing to your projects. Knowing compatibility details and integration tips helps you avoid common setup pitfalls and improves your build and test workflows.

### Who Should Use This Page?
- C++ developers preparing to adopt GoogleTest for unit and integration testing.
- Build engineers integrating GoogleTest into complex build systems.
- Technical leads evaluating compatibility for multi-platform development.

## Platform Support: Where GoogleTest Runs With Confidence

GoogleTest adheres to Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support), guaranteeing up-to-date compatibility with widely-used compiler and platform versions.

### Compilers and Standards

- **Modern C++ Requirement:** GoogleTest requires a C++17-compatible compiler.
- **Supported Compilers:** Includes recent versions of GCC, Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later), and others with active maintenance.

### Operating Systems & Environments

GoogleTest has stable, production-quality support for these major platforms:

- **Linux:** Mainstream distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS
- **Windows:** Desktop (native MSVC and MinGW environments), with partial support for Windows Phone and RT
- **Mac OS X & iOS:** Native support for Apple ecosystems
- **Other Platforms:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, QNX, z/OS, Haiku, Fuchsia (experimental/not officially supported)

*GoogleTest distinguishes itself by automatically detecting the platform environment during build to enable platform-specific optimizations and feature sets.*

### Multi-threading & Runtime Features

- Thread-safe tests enabled where POSIX threads or Windows threads are supported.
- Death tests supported on platforms with file system access and process control.

For an exhaustive and evolving matrix, refer to [GoogleTest Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

<Info>
GoogleTest updates platform support regularly. Monitor release notes to track any new versions or dropped support.

## Integration Strategies: Bringing GoogleTest Into Your Build

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with popular C++ build systems, enabling effortless automation of testing within your project lifecycle.

### 1. CMake Integration

GoogleTest ships with a top-level `CMakeLists.txt` that supports:

- **Standalone Build:** Build GoogleTest and GoogleMock independently or together.
- **In-project Embedding:** Use `add_subdirectory(googletest)` to include source and headers directly.
- **Package Discovery:** Use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` if installed on the system.

#### Practical Example: Embedding GoogleTest in Your CMake Project

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests GTest::gtest_main)
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

<Tip>
Override `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` in CMake if you want to build GoogleTest without GoogleMock.
</Tip>

### 2. Bazel Support

GoogleTest is fully supported with Bazel, Google's own high-performing build tool.

- Bazel package `//googletest:gtest` builds the combined GoogleTest and GoogleMock library.
- Selective build features for various platforms are managed using Bazel’s `config_setting`.
- Executables like `gtest_main` provide an entry point for your test binaries.

```bazel
cc_test(
    name = "my_test",
    srcs = ["my_test.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//googletest:gtest_main"],
)
```

### 3. Other Build Tools

GoogleTest can be integrated with other build tools (Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio, Xcode) by:
- Adding source files from `googletest/src`.
- Including headers from `googletest/include` and optionally `googlemock/include`.
- Linking to the compiled static or shared libraries.

### Build Environment Customization

GoogleTest supports toggling internal build macros (like thread support, exception handling) via defines such as `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` to better match your environment.

<Check>
Ensure your compiler targets C++17 or later to successfully build GoogleTest.

## Prominent Open-Source Projects Powered by GoogleTest

GoogleTest's reliability and feature richness make it a trusted testing framework across many influential projects:

- Chromium Browser: For comprehensive unit and integration test coverage.
- TensorFlow: Validating complex numerical computations.
- gRPC: Testing networked RPC APIs.
- Kubernetes: Ensuring core components behave as expected.

These projects illustrate GoogleTest's scalability from small utilities to expansive, distributed systems, reinforcing the benefits of its wide platform support and flexible integration.

---

## Practical Tips for Success

- **Choose Integration Method Early:** Embedding GoogleTest as a submodule or via package manager expedites maintenance.
- **Match Supported Compiler and Platform:** Verify environment compatibility to avoid build errors.
- **Use GoogleMock as Needed:** Combine with GoogleTest for powerful mocking support.
- **Configure Threading Options:** For multi-threaded tests, ensure your environment exposes pthreads or equivalent.

<Warning>
Attempting to build GoogleTest with unsupported compilers or on unsupported platforms will result in build failures.
</Warning>
