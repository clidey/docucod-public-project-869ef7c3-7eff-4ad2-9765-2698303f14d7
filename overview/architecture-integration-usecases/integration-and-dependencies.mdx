# Integration and Dependencies

## Introduction

This page explains how GoogleTest integrates with popular build systems, describes its key dependencies, supported platforms, and ongoing efforts to improve integration with additional libraries and third-party tools. Whether you are setting up your build scripts, IDEs, or CI pipelines, this guide provides practical insights to help you smoothly incorporate GoogleTest into your development workflow.

---

## Build System Integration

GoogleTest is designed to fit naturally into various C++ build environments. The two most commonly used build systems—**CMake** and **Bazel**—receive first-class support, making it straightforward to compile and link GoogleTest-powered tests.

### CMake Integration

GoogleTest provides CMake targets and configuration files to simplify its inclusion in projects using CMake.

- **Find Package**: Use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` to locate the GoogleTest library.
- **Targets and Linking**: Link your test targets against `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gtest_main` to use GoogleTest's framework and main entry point.
- **Customizing Build**: Options exist to control test build flags, enabling users to optimize for different platforms or debug settings.

Example snippet:

```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
add_executable(my_test my_test.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_test GTest::gtest GTest::gtest_main pthread)
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_test)
```

### Bazel Integration

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with Bazel through provided build rules:

- The repository includes BUILD files that define `cc_test` targets wrapping GoogleTest.
- Your test targets specify dependencies on `@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main` and `@com_google_googletest//:gtest`.
- Bazel automatically handles platform-specific flags and dependencies.

Example BUILD snippet:

```starlark
cc_test(
    name = "my_test",
    srcs = ["my_test.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gtest_main"],
)
```

## Dependencies and Platform Support

### Core Dependencies

GoogleTest builds upon standard C++ libraries and has minimal external dependencies:

- **C++ Standard Library**: Requires C++11 or later.
- **POSIX Threads (`pthread`)**: Required on POSIX-compliant operating systems for concurrency support.

### Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is actively maintained to work on a wide range of systems:

- **Linux (including various distributions)**
- **macOS**
- **Windows**
- **Cygwin**
- **QURT** (as a specialized embedded OS platform)

Platform-specific code manages threading and other system calls gracefully, ensuring consistent behavior.

## Integration with Other Libraries

### Abseil Library

GoogleTest is working towards tighter integration with the [Abseil C++ Common Libraries](https://abseil.io). While already compatible, ongoing efforts aim to:

- Facilitate Abseil's utility in test setups.
- Improve interoperability for a more seamless development experience.

Stay tuned for updated documentation as these integrations mature.

### Third-Party Tools, IDEs, and CI Systems

GoogleTest supports integration with a variety of development tools and continuous integration environments:

- **IDEs** like Visual Studio, CLion, and VS Code can be configured to detect and run GoogleTest cases, leveraging CMake or Bazel projects.
- **Continuous Integration**: GoogleTest's XML output format supports most CI systems such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI, allowing test results to be parsed and visualized.
- **Third-Party Test Runners** often provide built-in support or easy plugins for GoogleTest.

For more detailed setup instructions, consult the `Integration with Build Systems` and `Continuous Integration Best Practices` guides.

## Best Practices for Integration

- **Set Up Dependencies Explicitly**: Always confirm that linking against `pthread` or equivalent threading libraries is done where needed to avoid runtime issues.
- **Use Recommended Build Targets**: Leverage the provided CMake targets or Bazel rules rather than manual linking to reduce maintenance burden.
- **Keep Platform Targets Up To Date**: GoogleTest actively maintains platform compatibility; regularly update to benefit from new fixes.
- **Use Sequences for Ordered Expectations**: When integrating mocks in tests, utilize sequences (`InSequence`) to express call ordering cleanly.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Linker Errors**: Often caused by missing `pthread` when linking on POSIX systems. Ensure `pthread` is linked appropriately.

- **Platform-Specific Compilation Flags**: Different platforms may require additional compiler or linker flags. Consult your platform's CMake/Bazel guidelines.

- **Conflicts with Other Libraries**: When integrating with Abseil or other utility libraries, watch for symbol clashes or incompatible versions.

### Tips

- Enable verbose output in CMake (`cmake --trace-expand`) or Bazel (`bazel build --sandbox_debug`) to diagnose build problems.
- Use GoogleTest's flags like `--gtest_output=xml:` for CI compatibility verification.

## Summary

GoogleTest offers robust, well-documented integration with major build systems like CMake and Bazel, making it straightforward to incorporate automated testing into your C++ projects. Its minimal dependencies and broad platform support ensure compatibility across environments. Ongoing enhancements, including deeper Abseil integration and wide tooling support, further strengthen its ecosystem.
