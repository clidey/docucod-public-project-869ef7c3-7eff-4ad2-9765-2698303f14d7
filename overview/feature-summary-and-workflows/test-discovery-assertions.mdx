# Test Discovery and Assertions

## Unlock Automated Test Discovery and Harness Powerful Assertions

Testing is effortless when your framework discovers and executes tests automatically while providing rich assertions to precisely validate your code. The **Test Discovery and Assertions** page dives deep into how GoogleTest enhances your testing workflow with seamless test discovery and a comprehensive set of built-in assertions — including user-defined and parameterized variants. This guidance empowers you to write clear, concise, and robust test cases that validate behavior comprehensively.

## What Is Test Discovery and Assertions?

GoogleTest simplifies C++ testing through:

- **Automatic Test Discovery:** No need to manually list tests; GoogleTest finds and runs all defined tests matching naming conventions, speeding up your development cycle.
- **Rich Assertion Library:** Beyond basic checks, GoogleTest provides a variety of assertions that allow precise validation of conditions, expected values, and interactions.
- **Extensibility:** Supports user-defined and parameterized assertions so you can tailor testing logic exactly.

With this, you focus on writing the test intent rather than test boilerplate or test execution mechanics.

### What Test Discovery Solves

Manually specifying or invoking each test is tedious and error-prone. Test discovery lets you:

- Automatically run all tests without updates when you add or remove tests.
- Easily organize your tests as your code grows.
- Integrate smoothly with build and CI systems.

### Why GoogleTest’s Assertions Matter

GoogleTest’s rich assertions go beyond simple equality checks, enabling:

- Semantic validation (e.g., floating-point comparisons within tolerance).
- Complex conditions validation with clear failure messages.
- Parameterized assertions to reduce duplication.

Together, test discovery and assertions remove friction from test case creation and validation.

## Key Features of Test Discovery and Assertions

- **Automatic Test Registration**: Simply define your tests using the TEST or TEST_F macros. GoogleTest automatically registers them behind the scenes for execution.

- **Wide Range of Built-in Assertions**: Includes `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NEAR`, and more, covering primitive types, strings, containers, and pointers.

- **User-Defined Assertions**: Create custom assertion macros or functions that fit your domain logic, enhancing test clarity and maintainability.

- **Parameterized Assertions & Tests**: Easily reuse test logic across multiple input values with parameterized tests and assertion macros.

- **Verbose Reporting and Diagnostics**: When assertions fail, GoogleTest produces detailed messages indicating the expected vs actual, aiding quick debugging.

- **Failure Types & Control Flow**:
  - `EXPECT_` macros report failures but continue execution.
  - `ASSERT_` macros abort the current test on failure, useful for prerequisite conditions.

- **Integration with GoogleMock**: Assertions help verify mock expectations as part of the test run.

## Why This Matters: Benefits and Use Cases

### Outcomes You Can Expect

- **Efficient Testing Workflow**: Define tests once, run all anytime automatically.
- **Clear Failure Indications**: Quickly identify which condition failed and why.
- **Maintainable Tests**: Use parameterization and custom assertions to reduce boilerplate.
- **Reliable Validations**: Catch edge cases and floating-point approximations accurately.

### Common Use Cases

- Validating function outputs under multiple inputs effortlessly.
- Testing complex class behaviors with expressive defeat conditions.
- Ensuring API contract adherence with ordered test discovery and validation.

### Before and After GoogleTest

| Without GoogleTest                             | With GoogleTest                              |
| ---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Manual test invocation, risk of omissions     | Automatic test detection and execution       |
| Primitive asserts, poor diagnostic messages  | Rich assertions with detailed diagnostics  |
| High duplication for similar tests            | Parameterized tests and assertions          |
| Difficult mocking and validation integration | Seamless mock integration and assertions    |

## Getting Started Preview

Starting with test discovery and assertions is straightforward:

- Write your test case using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Use built-in assertions such as `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE` to validate conditions.
- Run your test binary; GoogleTest discovers and executes all tests automatically.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with GoogleTest basics.
- Include `<gtest/gtest.h>` in your test files.

### Next Steps

- Explore the [Writing Your First Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.md) guide.
- Dive into [Matchers and Assertions](../api-reference/matchers-actions-cardinalities/argument-matchers.md) for advanced validation.
- Combine with GoogleMock for interaction testing via [Mocking: Mock Objects & Expectations](../overview/feature-summary-and-workflows/mocking-mock-objects-overview.md).

## Example: Basic Test Case with Automatic Discovery and Assertions

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple function to test.
int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// This test will be auto-discovered and run by GoogleTest.
TEST(AdditionTest, HandlesPositiveNumbers) {
    EXPECT_EQ(Add(1, 2), 3);  // Simple equality assertion
    EXPECT_NE(Add(1, 2), 4);  // Inequality
}

TEST(AdditionTest, HandlesNegativeNumbers) {
    ASSERT_TRUE(Add(-1, -1) < 0);  // Boolean assertion
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Running the above executable triggers discovery and execution of these two tests without extra configuration.

## Tips for Writing Effective Assertions

- Prefer `EXPECT_` over `ASSERT_` when tests can continue meaningfully after failure.
- Use expressive matchers like `EXPECT_NEAR` for floating-point checks.
- Group related assertions to document what each test validates clearly.
- Leverage parameterized tests to handle multiple inputs efficiently.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No tests run?** Check your test functions use correct macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`).
- **False positives on failures?** Differentiate between `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` usage.
- **Assertion messages unclear?** Supplement with custom messages or use detailed matchers.
