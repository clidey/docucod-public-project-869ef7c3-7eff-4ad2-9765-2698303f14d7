# Core Features At a Glance

GoogleTest, together with GoogleMock, provides a powerful and flexible C++ testing framework designed to simplify test development and ensure code correctness. This page offers a concise overview of their most essential capabilities, giving new and returning users a clear orientation to the features that make GoogleTest and GoogleMock invaluable tools in C++ testing.

## Expressive Test Definitions

Writing tests with GoogleTest allows you to define clear, intuitive test cases that directly express intent. You create test fixtures and individual test cases using straightforward macros, enabling:

- Grouping related tests in test suites.
- Setting up common environments with fixtures.
- Maintaining clean and readable test code.

This structure saves time and avoids boilerplate, helping you focus on verifying behavior.

## Rich and Comprehensive Assertions

GoogleTest equips you with a broad set of assertion macros to validate your code's correctness with clarity:

- Simple equality and relational assertions (`EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_LT`, etc.).
- Compound assertions supporting predicate matching.
- Support for floating point, string, container, and pointer types.
- Custom assertion support for domain-specific checks.

These assertions provide detailed failure messages, making debugging efficient.

## Value- and Type-Parameterized Tests

To promote reuse and test coverage, GoogleTest supports:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic with multiple fixed input values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Write generic test code that runs across different types.

This eliminates redundant code and ensures thorough testing across variants.

## Automatic Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically detects all defined tests without manual registration:

- Tests are identified and registered at compile-time or runtime.
- Supports fine-grained test filtering by name or attributes.
- Enables running single tests or whole test suites seamlessly.

This streamlined execution cycle accelerates feedback loops.

## Death Tests

When your code needs to be validated against fatal failures or crashes, GoogleTest provides death tests that:

- Assert that specific code paths cause program termination.
- Isolate and verify behavior in unsafe or error conditions.

These tests increase confidence in handling critical failures safely.

## Flexible Test Execution Options

GoogleTest allows customization of test runs to fit your workflow:

- Command-line flags for selecting tests and verbosity.
- Configurable execution order and parameter passing.
- Integration with continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

This adaptability supports both simple and complex testing strategies.

## GoogleMock Support for Mocking

Complementing GoogleTest, GoogleMock extends your testing capabilities with robust mocking support:

- Define mock classes easily using the `MOCK_METHOD` macros.
- Specify precise expectations on mock method calls, arguments, and call order.
- Control mock behavior with actions, including return values, side effects, and delegation.
- Supports strict, nice, and naggy mock objects to tune behaviors around uninteresting calls.
- Provides matchers to flexibly describe expected input patterns.

This lets you isolate components, test interactions, and simulate complex scenarios without real dependencies.

## Why You Should Care? 

Because GoogleTest with GoogleMock drastically elevates your C++ testing experience by making it more expressive, maintainable, and reliable. From beginners writing their first tests to experts building comprehensive suites with mock dependencies, these core features streamline your development.

Imagine catching bugs early with richly specified tests, effortlessly testing edge cases with parameterized tests, and controlling dependencies precisely using mocks. This leads to faster development cycles, less flaky tests, and higher confidence in your code.

## Getting Started Preview

Jump into your first test by creating a simple test case with GoogleTest and mocking a collaborator with GoogleMock. Begin by including `<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>`, define your mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD`, set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`, and run your tests using `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with C++.
- GoogleTest and GoogleMock installed.
- Your project's build system configured to link with GoogleTest.

### Next Steps

Move on to the "[Writing Your First C++ Test](../guides/core-testing-workflows/writing-basic-tests)" page to see concrete examples and detailed instructions.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` to specify expected interactions clearly and only as needed.
- Prefer `NiceMock` when uninteresting calls are acceptable to reduce warning spam.
- Use sequences and `InSequence` to enforce call order when necessary, but avoid over-constraining.
- Employ parameterized tests to cover broad input spaces without redundancy.
- Customize default mock behaviors with `ON_CALL` for stable baselines.
- Take advantage of verbose flags (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to diagnose unexpected test behavior.

## Common Pitfalls

- Setting expectations *after* the mock method is called leads to undefined behavior.
- Overusing `StrictMock` can cause brittle tests that fail on harmless refactors.
- Not defining virtual destructors on mocked interfaces can cause mysterious leaks.
- Beware of expectations that are overly specific, leading to false failures.
