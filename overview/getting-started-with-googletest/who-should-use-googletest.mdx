## Before & After: How GoogleTest Improves Your Workflow

| Scenario                          | Without GoogleTest                              | With GoogleTest                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Writing Tests                    | Manual test harnesses, difficult to maintain   | Easy to write and organize with TEST and TEST_F     |
| Running Tests                   | Manually invoking test binaries or scripts     | One command to run all tests with detailed output   |
| Debugging Failures              | Poor feedback, test dependencies interfering    | Isolated test runs, rich assertion diagnostic info  |
| Cross-Platform Testing          | Separate test frameworks per OS                 | Write once, run anywhere with platform neutrality    |
| Continuous Integration          | Custom tooling needed                            | Native support for CI via exit codes and test listing|

## Getting Started Preview

To begin using GoogleTest as a C++ developer or tester, here is what to expect:

1. **Prerequisites:** You need a C++17 compatible compiler and basic familiarity with C++ build tools.
2. **Setup:** Install GoogleTest using your build system, with options for standalone or integrated builds (see the [Installation Methods](../getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installation-methods.md)).
3. **Writing Tests:** Start by defining simple `TEST()` cases or use `TEST_F()` for test fixtures to share setup code.
4. **Running Tests:** Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your test binary's `main()` to execute all registered tests and get summarized results.

For detailed instructions on installation and first test creation, refer to the [Getting Started with GoogleTest](../overview/getting-started-with-googletest/) group.

## Tips for Success

- **Name Tests Clearly:** Follow naming conventions to avoid conflicts and maximize clarity.
- **Group Related Tests:** Use test suites and fixtures for maintainability.
- **Control Test Scope:** Use filtering flags to run subsets of tests during development.
- **Leverage Advanced Features:** For complex scenarios, explore parameterized and typed tests.
- **Integrate Early:** Put tests in your CI pipeline as soon as possible.
