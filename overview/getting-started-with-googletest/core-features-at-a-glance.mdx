# Core Features at a Glance

GoogleTest and GoogleMock together provide a powerful, flexible framework that improves how you write and organize tests in C++. This page offers a concise snapshot of their essential features—such as the xUnit testing structure, rich assertions, parameterized tests, and advanced mocking capabilities—helping you quickly understand their strengths and see how they fit your development and testing needs.

## Structured Testing with xUnit Architecture

At its core, GoogleTest uses the xUnit architecture, enabling you to write clear and maintainable tests organized as test cases and test suites. This structure helps capture specific behaviors of your code effectively.

- **Test Cases and Tests:** Group related tests logically to improve organization and readability.
- **SetUp/TearDown Functions:** Easily initialize and clean up test environments for each test or test suite.
- **Assertions:** Use a comprehensive set of assertion macros to validate conditions, from simple boolean checks to complex expression evaluations.

This setup supports rigorous unit testing by encouraging modular, repeatable tests that are easy to understand and maintain.


## Rich and Expressive Assertions

GoogleTest offers an extensive assertion library that goes beyond simple `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE` checks. It also supports:

- **Typed Assertions:** Specific macros for floating points, strings, containers, and others.
- **Fatal vs Non-fatal Assertions:** Choose whether a test stops immediately on failure (`ASSERT_*`) or continues (`EXPECT_*`).
- **Predicate Assertions:** Flexibly test complex conditions without writing custom code.

These provide precise feedback and make test failures easier to triage.


## Parameterized Testing

Reduce code duplication and comprehensively test under varying conditions through parameterized tests:

- Define common test logic once.
- Run the same test with different inputs automatically.

Example:

```cpp
class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, CheckValue) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveInts, MyTest, ::testing::Values(1, 5, 10));
```

This approach accelerates coverage without repetitive test code.

## GoogleMock: Advanced Mocking Framework

GoogleMock complements GoogleTest by enabling you to create mock objects—stand-ins for real class instances—to precisely control and verify interactions in your tests.

- **Declarative Mock Methods:** Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to define mock methods easily, mirroring the interface of the real class.
- **Expectations and Behaviors:** Define expected calls with `EXPECT_CALL` and specify their behavior (e.g., return values, side effects).
- **Matchers:** Leverage powerful argument matchers to flexibly specify expected input values.
- **Sequences and Ordering:** Enforce or relax call order constraints using `InSequence` or `After` clauses to match your test’s requirements.

Example usage:

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  // ... other mocked methods ...
};

MockTurtle turtle;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(1);
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100)).Times(1);

// Exercise the code under test...
```

GoogleMock immediately reports violations of your expectations, improving test accuracy and reliability.


## Seamless Integration Between Testing and Mocking

Since GoogleMock is built on top of GoogleTest, you get:

- **Unified Test Execution:** No need for separate frameworks.
- **Shared Assertions:** Write assertions after exercising mocked interactions.
- **Consistent Reporting:** Clear error messages with stack traces and call details.

---

## Why This Matters

With these core features, you can write tests that are:

- **Fast and Reliable:** Mocking external dependencies eliminates costly set-ups.
- **Maintainable:** Clear structure and expressive syntax reduce test fragility.
- **Comprehensive:** Parameterized tests and matchers boost coverage without bloat.

GoogleTest and GoogleMock empower you to build high-quality C++ code with confidence.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin:

- Include the necessary headers (`<gtest/gtest.h>` and `<gmock/gmock.h>`).
- Define and implement your mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Write tests with test cases and assertions.
- Set expectations with `EXPECT_CALL` to control mock behaviors.

From here, you can explore [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) or the [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html).
