## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Align GoogleTest version with your build system's compatibility requirements to avoid conflicts.**
- **For embedded or constrained environments, verify supported variants and adjust configurations accordingly.**
- **Utilize GoogleMock in tandem with GoogleTest for richer unit testing, especially when dependencies require mocking.**
- **Leverage the built-in test discovery and execution integration possible with many build systems to automate runs efficiently.**
- **Regularly monitor the official repositories for ecosystem tools and updates to stay current.**

## Common Pitfalls

- Attempting integration without considering platform constraints may cause unexpected build errors.
- Ignoring default dependencies can lead to missing symbols or runtime failures.
- Overlooking ordering or configuration in build systems can prevent tests from executing properly.
- Failing to use `InitGoogleMock()` for initializing both GoogleTest and GoogleMock can cause incomplete test runs.
