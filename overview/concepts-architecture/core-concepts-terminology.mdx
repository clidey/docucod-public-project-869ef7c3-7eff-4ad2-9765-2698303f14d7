# Essential Concepts & Terminology

Learn the foundational vocabulary that is key to effectively using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This reference covers essential definitions and explanations for key testing concepts such as Test Cases, Assertions, Fixtures, Parameterized Tests, Mocks, Death Tests, and Test Runners. Understanding these terms will empower you to write robust tests, interpret results clearly, and leverage advanced GoogleTest features with confidence.

---

## Test Cases

A **Test Case** in GoogleTest groups one or more tests that share common setup and teardown code. A test case corresponds roughly to a test suite in other frameworks.

- It is created by inheriting from `::testing::Test` or using the `TEST` macro.
- Allows grouping logically related tests.
- Facilitates reuse of common code through fixtures.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1 + 1, 2);
}
```
Here `MathTest` is the test case, and `Addition` is a test within it.

---

## Assertions

Assertions are statements that verify conditions in your tests. They cause test failures when those conditions are not met.

Key assertion types in GoogleTest:

- `EXPECT_*`: Non-fatal failures; test continues.
- `ASSERT_*`: Fatal failures; test aborts immediately.

### Common Assertions Include:
- `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`: Checks equality.
- `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)`: Checks inequality.
- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`, `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)`: Boolean checks.

Assertions are used to verify actual output against expected results.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(MyTest, ValueCheck) {
  int value = GetValue();
  ASSERT_GT(value, 0);  // Must be greater than 0 or test stops
  EXPECT_EQ(value, 42); // Should be 42; logs failure but continues
}
```

## Fixtures

A **Test Fixture** allows you to define a per-test set-up and tear-down environment. It helps when multiple tests share common objects or resources.

- Created by deriving a class from `::testing::Test`.
- Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for initialization and cleanup.
- Tests using a fixture use `TEST_F` macro.

**Example:**
```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }
  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryTest) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Query("SELECT * FROM users"));
}
```

---

## Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test logic with different inputs.

- Define a test fixture inheriting from `::testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
- Use `TEST_P` macro to declare parameterized tests.
- Instantiate tests with multiple parameter sets using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

This increases test coverage and avoids code duplication.

**Example:**
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, CheckEvenness) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```
Here, `CheckEvenness` runs four times, once for each even number.

---

## Mocks (GoogleMock)

Mock objects replace real objects during testing to verify interactions.

- Defined by creating a mock class with methods mocked using `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Used with `EXPECT_CALL()` to set expectations on method calls.
- Allow specifying arguments, cardinalities (number of expected calls), and actions (return values or side effects).

**Example:**
```cpp
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetRowCount, (), (const));
};

TEST(MyTest, Connection) {
  MockDatabase db;
  EXPECT_CALL(db, Connect()).Times(1).WillOnce(Return(true));
  ASSERT_TRUE(db.Connect());
}
```
Mocking helps isolate tested code, verify correct interaction patterns, and simulate error conditions.

---

## Death Tests

Death tests verify that code terminates as expected under fatal conditions.

- Use `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)` or `ASSERT_DEATH`.
- The second parameter is a regex matching the expected output on termination.

They are useful for testing assertions and error handling that results in program exit.

**Example:**
```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, CrashesOnNull) {
  Foo* foo = nullptr;
  EXPECT_DEATH({ foo->DoSomething(); }, "null pointer");
}
```

---

## Test Runners

The **Test Runner** is responsible for:

- Discovering all registered tests.
- Executing them.
- Reporting results.

GoogleTest provides its own test runner which automatically runs all tests discovered by the macros. You can use test filters to run subsets.

Example of running tests with a filter:
```bash
test_binary --gtest_filter=MathTest.*
```

You can also control test execution via command-line flags for verbosity, shuffling tests, and generating XML reports.

## Practical Tips

- **Use fixtures to manage complex setup:** Prevents duplication and helps maintain tests.
- **Prefer `EXPECT_*` for recoverable checks:** Continue tests after failures to collect multiple errors.
- **Use parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios:** Keeps tests concise and comprehensive.
- **Mock only whatâ€™s needed:** To keep tests simple and focused.
- **Run death tests separately if needed:** Some platforms require special handling.
