## What Is This Page?

This page presents a concise yet comprehensive survey of GoogleTest's core and advanced features. It focuses on enabling users to understand at a glance what the framework offers to help write, discover, and execute robust unit tests and mock objects.

Instead of delving into setup or architecture details, it provides a clear summary of key testing patterns, assertion capabilities, parameterization techniques, failure handling mechanisms, and the integration of GoogleMock for mocks and expectations.

Armed with this feature map, you can quickly assess which tools and strategies to apply in your testing workflow.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. Automatic Test Discovery
GoogleTest automatically detects test cases and runs them without manual registration, streamlining the test execution flow.

### 2. Built-in Assertions
- **Rich Assertion Macros:** Use `EXPECT_` and `ASSERT_` macros to make various checks on values.
- **Fatal vs Non-Fatal Failures:** Choose between stopping test execution immediately (`ASSERT_`) or continuing after failure (`EXPECT_`).
- **Customizable Matchers:** Extend or use built-in matcher expressions to validate complex conditions.

### 3. Parameterized and Typed Tests
- **Parameterized Tests:** Define test logic once and run it with multiple sets of input data.
- **Typed Tests:** Run test templates over a list of types for broad type coverage with less code.

### 4. Flexible Mocking with GoogleMock
- **Declarative Mock Creation:** Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros to mock virtual methods easily.
- **Setting Expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`:** Specify how many times methods should be called, with what arguments, and in what order.
- **Default Behavior via `ON_CALL`:** Define default actions without setting expectations.
- **Controlling Call Strictness:** Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` to manage reactions to unexpected calls.
- **Ordering Rules:** Enforce call orders with `InSequence` and `After` clauses.
- **Advanced Actions:** Define custom actions, delegate to real or fake objects, and combine multiple actions.

### 5. Failure Handling
- **Clear Diagnostic Messages:** When tests fail, detailed reports including source location and mismatched expectations help debugging.
- **Retiring Expectations:** Automatically manage expectation retirement for better state management.

## Real-World Usage Context

Use this feature overview to design your tests and mocks intuitively:

- When needing simple assertion checks, rely on built-in macros for clear, concise tests.
- For data-driven testing, employ parameterized tests to reduce duplication.
- To isolate dependencies, create mocks with `MOCK_METHOD` and flexibly control behavior and call expectations.
- Manage test robustness easily by controlling mock strictness levels.

Compare using GoogleTest with and without mocking infrastructure:

| Scenario               | Without GoogleMock            | With GoogleMock                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Dependency isolation   | Difficult to test independently | Mocks isolate dependencies effectively |
| Verification of interactions | Limited or manual checks        | Rich expectation DSL automates verification |
| Test maintenance      | Likely brittle, tightly coupled | More maintainable and adaptable |

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Start with `ON_CALL` to specify default mock behaviors; use `EXPECT_CALL` for concrete interaction verification.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on irrelevant calls during tests.
- Apply `StrictMock` only where every unexpected call is a test failure.
- Structure expectations using sequences (`InSequence`) when call order matters.
- Avoid over-specification to keep tests resilient against refactoring.
- Delegate to real or fake objects when full mock behavior is complex.

## Getting Started Preview

To begin applying these features:

1. Define your test cases using GoogleTest macros for assertions.
2. Learn to write parameterized tests for reusable test logic.
3. Create mock classes using `MOCK_METHOD` to simulate dependencies.
4. Use `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to specify mock behaviors and expectations.
