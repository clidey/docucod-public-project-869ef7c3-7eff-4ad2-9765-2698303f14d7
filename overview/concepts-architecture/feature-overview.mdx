# Feature Overview

GoogleTest offers a robust and intuitive mocking framework, enabling you to write expressive and maintainable tests in C++. This page provides a concise walkthrough of GoogleTest’s headline features that empower you to define sophisticated test behaviors and verify interactions effectively.

---

## The xUnit Architecture

GoogleTest follows the well-established xUnit test framework model. At its core, tests are organized into test cases containing individual test functions, promoting modular and isolated testing. This architecture supports extensibility, allowing advanced features such as parameterized tests, fixtures, and mocks to integrate seamlessly.

## Automatic Test Discovery

Forget manual registration of tests. GoogleTest automatically discovers all test cases and test functions in your codebase. This feature simplifies adding new tests and ensures comprehensive coverage without boilerplate.

## Rich Suite of Assertions

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive set of assertions to validate program correctness. From basic checks to advanced matchers, these assertions enable precise verification of test expectations and produce clear failure messages to speed up debugging.

## User-Defined Assertions

Extend the power of assertions with your own custom validations tailored to your types and domain logic. User-defined assertions help you express intent clearly and verify complex properties beyond built-in primitives.

## Death Test Support

GoogleTest supports death tests, allowing you to verify that certain code paths terminate the program in expected ways. This is particularly useful to test failure conditions, invalid input handling, or fatal error paths.

## Parameterized Tests

Write test logic once and run it against a variety of input data. Parameterized tests help improve test code reuse and make it easier to cover multiple scenarios systematically.

## Flexible Test Runners

GoogleTest offers flexible ways to run tests, including from the command line with numerous options for filtering, sharding, and output formats. This adaptability ensures that your tests fit into diverse workflows and CI environments.

## Real-World Usage Scenario

Imagine you are developing a complex C++ application requiring precise verification of component interactions. You can leverage GoogleTest’s mocking framework to define expectations on mock objects using `EXPECT_CALL()`, specifying how many times methods are called, the sequence of calls, the specific arguments, and the return behaviors.

For example, define a mock class with `MOCK_METHOD()` macros to represent dependencies, then write tests that set up expectations and default behaviors using `EXPECT_CALL()` and `ON_CALL()`. You can verify that your code calls the methods correctly and handle different call sequences by using `Sequence` objects and clauses like `.InSequence()` or `.After()`.

### Example: Defining and Using Mocks
```cpp
class MockFoo {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetCount, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Add, (int value), (override));
};

TEST(FooTest, UsesMockCorrectly) {
  MockFoo mock;

  // Set expectation that Add() will be called twice with any int parameter
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Add(testing::_)).Times(2);

  // Set default behavior for GetCount()
  ON_CALL(mock, GetCount()).WillByDefault(testing::Return(42));

  // Use mock in code under test
  mock.Add(10);
  mock.Add(20);
  EXPECT_EQ(42, mock.GetCount());
}
```

This snippet shows how GoogleTest eases mocking by automatically generating the mock class methods and providing expressive ways to specify call expectations and behaviors.

## Deep Dive into Headline Features

### MOСK_METHOD: Defining Mocks with Ease
- Define mock methods with precise signatures, including qualifiers like `const` or `override`.
- Supports mocking overloaded and templated methods.
- Handles move-only types such as `std::unique_ptr` seamlessly.

### EXPECT_CALL: Setting Clear Expectations
- Define how often a method should be called (`Times` clause).
- Specify call sequences using `.InSequence()` to enforce order.
- Use `.After()` to define more complex ordering dependencies.
- Attach actions with `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` to control return values or side effects.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to automatically deactivate expectations after saturation to avoid unexpected call errors.

### ON_CALL: Setting Default Behavior
- Specify default actions for mock methods without setting call count expectations.
- Must specify behavior with `.WillByDefault()`.
- Complements `EXPECT_CALL` by providing base method behaviors.

### Matchers: Fine-Grained Argument Matching
- Use predefined matchers like `_` (wildcard), `Eq()`, `Ge()`, and many more for matching arguments.
- Combine multiple matchers with `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and custom predicates.
- Apply multi-argument matching with `.With()` clause for cross-argument conditions.

### Sequences and Partial Orders
- Use `Sequence` or `InSequence` objects to express strict ordering between expectations.
- Define partial order using multiple sequences for flexible test scenarios.

### Strictness Modifiers: Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks
- `NiceMock`: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, useful when you want quieter tests.
- `NaggyMock` (default): Prints warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock`: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures, useful for enforcing strict interaction contracts.

### Verification and Cleanup
- Automatic verification of all expectations when mock objects are destructed.
- Manual verification support via `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` and `Mock::VerifyAndClear()`.
- Leak detection to catch mocks that are not properly deleted with detailed diagnostics.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Use `EXPECT_CALL` only before exercising your code.** Changing expectations afterward leads to undefined behavior.
- **Prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` for verifying calls.**
- **When you want to ignore uninteresting calls, use `NiceMock`; for strict checks use `StrictMock`.**
- **Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to prevent sticky expectations from causing errors after their call count is met.**
- **Leverage `Sequence` and `.After()` to express call ordering requirements clearly.**
- **For complex argument or behavior validation, use custom matchers and actions.**

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### Uninteresting Calls Warnings
Uninteresting calls occur when a mock method is called without any matching `EXPECT_CALL`. GoogleTest warns by default to alert you but allows the calls. Use `NiceMock` to suppress these warnings or define explicit expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.

### Unexpected Calls Errors
If a call does not match any active expectation, an error is reported immediately, helping catch unexpected or incorrect behavior.

### Excessive Calls
Calling a mock function more times than expected triggers a failure, unless an expectation allows unlimited calls with `Times(AnyNumber())` or a `WillRepeatedly()` action is defined.

### Leaked Mocks
GoogleTest detects mocks that are never deleted and reports failures. Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to suppress if intentional, but generally, prefer proper mock lifecycle management.
