# Feature Overview

Welcome to the Feature Overview of GoogleTest, Google's open-source C++ testing framework that seamlessly integrates with GoogleMock. This page presents the headline features that make GoogleTest a trusted ally in your testing journey — from reliable test discovery and rich assertion types, to powerful parameterization, death tests, customizable assertions, and comprehensive mocking capabilities. Each feature is designed to empower you with precise control over your test execution, robust diagnostics, and flexible extensibility.

## Test Discovery and Organization

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests across your codebase, organizing them into suites for structured execution. With its intuitive naming conventions and hierarchical test suite structure, you can effortlessly manage complex test sets.

- **Automatic Test Detection:** Simply use the `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros, and GoogleTest handles the rest.
- **Test Suites:** Group related tests logically for better management and execution.
- **Run All or Select Tests:** Use filters to run all tests or a targeted subset.

*Example:* Running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` executes every discovered test across all test suites.

## Assertion Types: Fatal vs. Non-Fatal

GoogleTest provides two classes of assertions to fit your testing style:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`):** Halt the current test immediately on failure, preventing cascading errors.
- **Non-Fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`):** Record failures but continue test execution, allowing multiple issues to be detected in a single run.

This distinction gives you fine-grained control on when to stop or proceed, enabling faster debugging workflows.

## Test Parameterization

Maximize test coverage and reduce duplication using GoogleTest's **parameterized** and **typed tests** features:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test logic over multiple input values using fixtures derived from `TestWithParam<T>` and `TEST_P` macros.
- **Typed Tests:** Validate code against multiple types by defining test fixtures templated on types, then instantiating with various type lists.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Define abstract test logic and instantiate with concrete types separately, promoting code reuse.

This enables comprehensive, maintainable tests with minimal boilerplate.

## Death Tests

When your code needs to be validated for conditions that cause it to terminate — such as failing `CHECK`s or aborts — GoogleTest provides dedicated **death tests** with these capabilities:

- **Macros:** `ASSERT_DEATH()`, `EXPECT_DEATH()`, `ASSERT_EXIT()`, and `EXPECT_EXIT()` let you assert process termination with specific exit statuses and error messages.
- **Thread-Safety Modes:** Choose between "fast" and "threadsafe" styles to balance speed and reliability in multithreaded environments.
- **Naming Convention:** Test suites ending with "DeathTest" are prioritized to run before others, ensuring reliable test ordering.

Death tests help ensure your program fails gracefully and predictably under fatal conditions.

## Custom Assertions and Predicate Formats

Beyond built-in assertions, GoogleTest enables expressive custom validation:

- **Predicate Assertions (`EXPECT_PRED*`, `ASSERT_PRED*`):** Use existing boolean functions for assertions that provide meaningful output on failure.
- **AssertionResult API:** Craft functions returning `AssertionResult` for fine-grained success/failure and customizable messages.
- **Predicate-Formatter Assertions:** Fully control failure message formatting with `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT*` and `ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT*` for complex conditions or types lacking `operator<<` support.

Use these to build domain-specific assertions that improve clarity and debug efficiency.

## Mocking Support via GoogleMock

GoogleTest integrates tightly with GoogleMock to enable simulated behavior for complex dependencies:

- **Mock Classes and Methods:** Define mocks with `MOCK_METHOD` macros to expect and control interactions.
- **Actions and Expectations:** Specify detailed behavior, constraints, and call sequences.
- **Strictness Controls:** Use `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` for varying levels of strictness to balance test stability and coverage.
- **Advanced Customization:** Implement custom actions and stubs for unique testing scenarios.

These capabilities make it simpler to test components in isolation and validate interactions.

## Flexible Test Execution Controls

GoogleTest offers multiple flags and environment variables to control test execution flow and output:

- **Filtering:** Run subsets of tests using flexible glob patterns via `--gtest_filter`.
- **Shuffling and Repeating:** Detect order-dependent failures by randomizing test execution and repeating runs.
- **Break-on-Failure & Exception Throwing:** Halt on failures with debugger breakpoints or exceptions.
- **Output Options:** Generate detailed XML/JSON reports, stream test results remotely, or disable output clutter.
- **Global Setup/Teardown:** Define and register environments for setup and tear down beyond individual test suites.

These controls let you tailor your testing workflow for simplicity or complexity as needed.

## Practical Tips

- Use `TEST_F` for tests sharing complex fixtures with setup and teardown.
- Employ `ASSERT_*` when failure should halt the current test, and `EXPECT_*` to continue testing after failures.
- Adopt parameterized and typed tests early to maximize coverage with minimal code.
- Follow the "DeathTest" suffix convention to ensure death tests execute reliably.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual trace messages for easier failure tracking in deeply nested calls.
- Capture additional test metadata using `RecordProperty` for enhanced reporting.
