# Common Use Cases

GoogleTest is a versatile C++ testing framework designed to support a wide range of testing scenarios. This page outlines typical workflows where GoogleTest shines, such as unit testing algorithms, verifying system-level invariants, mocking dependencies in isolation, and establishing regression safety nets. Through concrete scenarios and reference examples, you'll see how GoogleTest empowers you to write clear, maintainable, and powerful tests.

## 1. Unit Testing Algorithms

At the core of software quality is ensuring that individual components behave as expected. GoogleTest provides a simple and effective way to write unit tests, whether for pure functions or complex classes.

### How It Helps

- **Isolate your logic:** Each test runs independently with its own fixture, preventing side effects.
- **Rich assertions:** Assertions like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, and more complex predicates enable you to verify outputs precisely.
- **Detailed failure reports:** When tests fail, GoogleTest shows informative messages, including the location and values involved.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have a mathematical function `Factorial`:

```cpp
// Tests factorial of 0.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

// Tests factorial of positive numbers.
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

These tests clearly define expectations and provide self-explanatory failure messages.

## 2. Verifying System-Level Invariants

Beyond unit testing, GoogleTest supports hierarchical test organization, where you can verify system invariants or end-to-end properties.

### Leveraging Test Suites and Fixtures

- Group related tests into **test suites** that reflect your application's modular architecture.
- Use **test fixtures** to initialize shared system state or resources, making tests cleaner and more maintainable.
- Employ `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to manage expensive setup/tear-down for the entire suite.

### Common Example

Testing a resource manager class might require extensive setup for test data:

```cpp
class ResourceManagerTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Initialize shared, expensive to build resource
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Clean up
  }
  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare fresh state before each test
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup after each test
  }
};

TEST_F(ResourceManagerTest, AllocatesResource) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(resource_manager_.Allocate());
}

TEST_F(ResourceManagerTest, ReleasesResource) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(resource_manager_.Release());
}
```

This pattern ensures repeatable, isolated tests while sharing costly setup.

## 3. Mocking Dependencies in Isolation

Testing components that interact with external systems or complex dependencies is simplified with GoogleMock, an integral add-on to GoogleTest.

### Key Benefits

- **Create mock objects:** Define expectations and simulate behavior of dependencies.
- **Control test environment:** Verify how your code interacts with dependencies without requiring actual implementations.
- **Improve test reliability:** Eliminate flakiness caused by external systems.

### Typical Workflow

1. Define a mock class implementing the interface:
   ```cpp
   class MockDatabase : public DatabaseInterface {
    public:
     MOCK_METHOD(void, Connect, (), (override));
     MOCK_METHOD(bool, Query, (const std::string&), (override));
   };
   ```
2. Set expectations in your test:
   ```cpp
   TEST(DataProcessorTest, HandlesEmptyQuery) {
     MockDatabase mock_db;
     EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1);
     EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query("SELECT * FROM users")).WillOnce(Return(false));
     DataProcessor processor(&mock_db);
     EXPECT_FALSE(processor.Process());
   }
   ```
3. Run tests to verify behavior.

## 4. Establishing Regression Safety Nets

Running your tests automatically before every release or integration ensures that regressions are caught early.

### Why It Matters

- Confirm that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
- Track test results over time for quality metrics.
- Leverage test suites with parameterized and typed tests to cover diverse scenarios efficiently.

### How GoogleTest Supports This

- `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` enables generating many test cases from parameter sets, reducing boilerplate.
- Typed and type-parameterized tests allow the same logic to apply for multiple types, ideal for generic code.
- Automated test discovery lets you easily integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

Example of value-parameterized test:

```cpp
class StringTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};

TEST_P(StringTest, HandlesEmptyStrings) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(GetParam().empty());
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EmptyStringsTests, StringTest, testing::Values("", " ", "\t"));
```

## Reference Examples & Real-World Users

### Googletest Samples
You can explore practical test examples in the [googletest samples repository](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/googletest/samples). These samples cover basic to advanced test patterns:
- Basic unit tests
- Using test fixtures
- Type-parameterized and value-parameterized tests
- Test listeners and custom output

### Production Usage
GoogleTest is widely used inside Google and by many open-source projects to test everything from low-level algorithms to large-scale distributed systems.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- **Keep tests independent:** Avoid shared mutable state between tests to prevent flaky failures.
- **Use descriptive test and suite names:** Follow recommendations to avoid underscores to prevent naming conflicts (see [GoogleTest FAQ](../faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)).
- **Leverage fixtures for setup/teardown:** They reduce duplication and keep tests focused.
- **Use `EXPECT_*` vs `ASSERT_*` wisely:** Use `EXPECT_*` to gather multiple failures; use `ASSERT_*` when continuing makes no sense.
- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` for tracing subroutine failures:** Helps identify failing invocation points in shared helper functions.
- **Parameterized and typed tests increase coverage:** Ideal for testing multiple inputs or implementations with minimal code.

## Common Pitfalls

### Mixing Test Fixtures in Same Suite

All tests within a test suite must use the same fixture class. Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` or using different fixture classes in the same suite will cause runtime errors.

### Ignoring `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` Return Value

Always return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()` function to ensure test failures propagate properly in build systems and CI.

### Death Tests and Threads

Death tests (tests that expect crashes) have strict threading requirements. It's recommended to isolate death tests in suites named `*DeathTest` and to avoid creating threads outside death test statements.

### Parameterized Tests Without Instantiation

Defining `TEST_P` without corresponding `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` leads to test failures unless you explicitly allow uninstantiated tests using `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST()`.
