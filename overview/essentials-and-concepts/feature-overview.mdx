# Feature Overview

GoogleTest delivers a robust and versatile testing framework for C++ developers, covering the critical needs of unit testing, mocking, and integration with modern C++ codebases. This overview highlights the main features that empower you to write effective, maintainable, and expressive tests.

---

## xUnit-based Testing Framework

GoogleTest embraces the proven xUnit architecture, providing a familiar structure for defining test cases, suites, and fixtures. This design enables:

- **Simple Test Definitions:** Write tests as functions grouped logically into test cases.
- **Test Fixtures:** Define common setup and teardown for tests in a reusable class.
- **Assertions:** Rich set of assertion macros to validate conditions with informative failure messages.

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, AdditionWorks) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

class VectorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    v.push_back(1);
    v.push_back(2);
  }

  std::vector<int> v;
};

TEST_F(VectorTest, SizeIsTwo) {
  EXPECT_EQ(v.size(), 2);
}
```

---

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers and registers all tests in your codebase, eliminating the need for manual test registration. Benefits include:

- **Reduced Setup Overhead:** Just write tests and run them.
- **Integration with Build Systems:** Tests are automatically found by the test runner.
- **Command-Line Filtering:** Run subsets of tests by patterns or name filters.

---

## Rich Assertions

The framework provides a wide range of assertions to test values, complex conditions, and exceptions, helping you precisely express your checks:

- `EXPECT_*` and `ASSERT_*` macros for flexible control flow.
- Specialized assertions for equality, near-equality, exceptions, and more.
- Support for matcher-based assertions via `EXPECT_THAT()` for expressive, readable checks.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(IsPrime(7));
EXPECT_THROW(ThrowException(), MyException);
EXPECT_THAT(my_vector, ::testing::Contains(5));
```

---

## Parameterized and Typed Tests

Write reusable tests that run with multiple parameters or types, drastically reducing code duplication:

- **Parameterized Tests:** Run the same logic with different input values or combinations.
- **Typed Tests:** Write tests that work for a set of types, enabling generic verification.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class StackTest : public ::testing::Test {
  // test stack implementations for type T
};

using Implementations = ::testing::Types<int, float>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(StackTest, Implementations);

TYPED_TEST(StackTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  TypeParam stack;
  EXPECT_TRUE(stack.empty());
}

class MyTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTest, IsEven) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, MyTest, ::testing::Values(2,4,6));
```

---

## Test Runners and Execution

GoogleTest comes with flexible runners that can be embedded or used in standalone executables:

- **Command Line Interface:** Filter, repeat, shuffle, and list tests.
- **XML and JSON Output:** Integrate with CI/CD systems.
- **Customizable Plugins:** Extend with event listeners and plugins.

---

## Mocking Support through gMock

Seamlessly integrated, GoogleMock supports creating mock objects to isolate and verify interactions between components:

- Define mock classes easily using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- Set expectations with descriptive syntax (`EXPECT_CALL`).
- Control call order, cardinality, and behavior.
- Support for matchers and actions to customize argument matching and return values.

Example:

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PaintTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(10));

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  painter.DrawLine(10);
}
```

---

## Seamless Integration with Modern C++ Codebases

GoogleTest is designed to fit smoothly into contemporary C++ projects:

- Supports C++11 and later features, like move-only types and lambda-based actions.
- Works well with common build systems like CMake and Bazel.
- Compatible with modern IDEs and debugging tools.
- Offers rich utilities for working with STL containers and custom types in assertions and mocks.

---

### Practical Tips

- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` wrappers to control warnings and errors on uninteresting calls.
- Leverage `ON_CALL` for default mock behaviors without enforcing call expectations.
- Utilize sequences (`InSequence`, `Sequence`) to control call orders.
- Customize matchers and actions for advanced test scenarios.
