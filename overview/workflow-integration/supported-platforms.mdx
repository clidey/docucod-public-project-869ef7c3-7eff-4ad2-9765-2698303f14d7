# Supported Platforms and Environments

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to work across a broad range of operating systems and C++ compilers, reflecting Google’s commitment to cross-platform portability and flexibility. This page summarizes the platforms and environments supported by GoogleTest, grounding its support matrix in Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).

## Platform Compatibility

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform environment at compile time and configures itself accordingly to deliver a consistent testing experience. It supports a wide variety of platforms including but not limited to:

- **Desktop Operating Systems:** Windows (including Windows Desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile variants), Linux, macOS
- **Unix-like Systems:** FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, GNU Hurd, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, QNX
- **Embedded and Specialized Platforms:** Android (via Linux support), Fuchsia, Native Client (NaCl), ESP8266, ESP32, XTensa, Haiku, z/OS

GoogleTest’s platform detection is implemented internally, for example in files like `gtest-port-arch.h`, which define macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC` to tailor behavior and integration points for each supported environment.


## Compiler and Build Tool Support

Consistent with the Foundational C++ Support Policy, GoogleTest supports:

- Modern C++ compilers that provide at least C++17 support, notably GCC, Clang, MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 and later), and Intel LLVM
- Build tools including CMake and Bazel (with dedicated documentation on integration available)

This ensures GoogleTest tests can be compiled and run smoothly in a variety of developer workflows and continuous integration setups.

## Threading and System Feature Availability

GoogleTest adjusts its internal features based on platform capabilities:

- **Thread Safety:** Enabled on platforms with POSIX threads (`pthread`) or appropriate Windows threading primitives.
- **Exception Support:** Adapted per compiler and platform support.
- **File System Access and Stream Redirection:** Supported on most desktop and server environments; limited or disabled on some embedded and mobile platforms.
- **Regular Expression Engines:** Selects an appropriate regex implementation depending on platform support (e.g., RE2 via Abseil, POSIX regex, or a built-in simple regex engine).

## Why Platform Support Matters

Cross-platform compatibility is a key strength of GoogleTest, enabling teams to write tests once and execute them reliably across development, test, and production environments on diverse platforms. It fosters portability, especially critical for projects targeting multiple operating systems or embedded devices.

## Where to Find the Canonical Support Matrix

For the most comprehensive and up-to-date listing of supported platforms, compiler versions, and build tools, consult:

- [Google’s Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
- [Foundational C++ Support Matrix on GitHub](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

These sources provide detailed versioning and compatibility details relevant to GoogleTest usage.

## Practical Tips for Users

- Always validate your platform and compiler against the support matrix before integration.
- If building on less common or custom platforms, check or define relevant `GTEST_OS_*` macros during build configuration.
- For multithreaded tests, ensure that your platform supports pthreads or Windows threading APIs to benefit from GoogleTest's thread safety.
- When using GoogleTest as part of larger builds, refer to integration instructions for build systems like CMake or Bazel to correctly handle platform-specific flags and dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

- If the platform is not detected correctly, manual definition of macros like `-DGTEST_OS_WINDOWS=1` or `-DGTEST_OS_LINUX=1` in your compiler flags may help.
- Lack of threading support will limit concurrent test execution and some synchronization features.
- On embedded or specialized platforms without file systems or standard I/O streams, some GoogleTest features such as death tests or stream capturing may not be available.

## Next Steps

- Explore the [Installing with CMake guide](/getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/installation-cmake) or [Installing with Bazel guide](/getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/installation-bazel) for platform-specific build guidance.
- Review the [System Requirements & Supported Platforms page](/getting-started/set-up-prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) for deeper prerequisites.
- For advanced platform-specific customization, see the [Customization Points](googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md) documentation.
