# Core Concepts & Terminology

Understand foundational testing concepts such as test cases, assertions, fixtures, mocks, expectations, death tests, and parameterized tests. This guide demystifies the jargon so you can confidently navigate and leverage the GoogleTest framework.

---

## Introduction: Why Understanding Core Concepts Matters

Imagine you're new to GoogleTest and you see terms like *TestSuite*, *Assertion*, *Mock*, or *Death Test* everywhere. These are more than just jargon—they are the building blocks that shape how you write, organize, and maintain tests effectively.

By mastering these foundational concepts and terminology, you will be empowered to write clearer, more reliable tests and fully harness the power of GoogleTest’s comprehensive capabilities.

---

## What Are Test Cases and Test Suites?

**Test Case (or Test):**
- An individual test you write that verifies one specific behavior or property of your code.
- Defined using macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`.

**Test Suite:**
- A collection of related tests grouped under a common name, usually reflecting a component or feature.
- Tests within a suite can share setup and teardown logic through fixture classes.


For example:
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}
```
Both tests belong to the `FactorialTest` test suite.

---

## Assertions: Checking What Matters

Assertions are the conditions you check inside tests to verify your code behaves as expected. GoogleTest offers two flavors:

- `EXPECT_*`: Generates a **nonfatal failure** and continues running the test.
- `ASSERT_*`: Generates a **fatal failure**, aborting the current function immediately.

### Examples:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result, expected) << "Values do not match";  // Nonfatal
ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer is null";          // Fatal
```

### Common assertion types include:
- Boolean conditions: `EXPECT_TRUE()`, `EXPECT_FALSE()`
- Equality/Inequality: `EXPECT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NE()`, `EXPECT_LT()`, etc.
- String comparisons: `EXPECT_STREQ()`, `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ()`
- Floating-point comparisons: `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NEAR()`
- Exception testing: `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW()`
- Death assertions: `EXPECT_DEATH()`, verifying that code terminates as expected
- Matcher-based assertions: `EXPECT_THAT()` with powerful matchers

The [Assertions Reference](../reference/assertions.md) provides a comprehensive list of available assertions.

## Test Fixtures: Reusing Setup Across Tests

Test fixtures let you use the **same setup** and **common resources** for multiple tests within the same suite.

To use fixtures:

1. Define a fixture class inheriting from `::testing::Test`.
2. Declare and initialize shared objects inside this class.
3. Use `TEST_F()` instead of `TEST()` to associate tests with the fixture.

Example:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(42);
  }
  Queue<int> queue_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsEnqueuedElement) {
  int* item = queue_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(item, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*item, 42);
  delete item;
}
```

This ensures a fresh `queue_` is set up for each test, keeping tests independent.

---

## Mocks and Expectations (GoogleMock)

Mocks simulate the behavior of external dependencies, enabling isolated testing.

- **Mocks** allow you to specify function call behaviors and expectations.
- You can verify if your code under test interacts with dependencies correctly.

Example usage:
```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
};

TEST(MockTest, ConnectCalledOnce) {
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).Times(1).WillOnce(Return(true));

  bool connected = mock_db.Connect();
  EXPECT_TRUE(connected);
}
```

Refer to the [Creating and Using Mock Objects](../guides/mocking-techniques/creating-mocks) and [Setting and Verifying Expectations](../guides/mocking-techniques/setting-expectations) for detailed guidance.

---

## Parameterized Tests: Writing Tests Once, Running Many Times

Parameterized tests enable running the **same test logic with multiple inputs**.

### Types:
- **Value-Parameterized Tests**: Test logic runs with different values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests**: Test logic runs with different types.

### Key macros:
- `TEST_P`: Defines a value-parameterized test.
- `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`: Instantiates the parameterized test suite with values.
- `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`: For typed tests.

Example:
```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueIfEven) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(param % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6));
```

This test runs 3 times with parameters 2, 4, and 6.

See [Parameterizing Tests with Types and Values](../guides/writing-effective-tests/test-parameterization) for more details.

---

## Expectations and Death Tests

### Expectations:
Expectations are a special kind of assertion mainly used with mocks to verify that certain calls happen.

### Death Tests:
- Test that code causes the program to terminate as expected.
- Verify that safety checks or fatal error handling behaves correctly.
- Use macros like `ASSERT_DEATH()`, `EXPECT_DEATH()`.

Example:
```cpp
ASSERT_DEATH({ AbortFunction(); }, "Fatal error occurred");
```

If your test suite contains death tests, **name the test suite with a `DeathTest` suffix** to ensure they run before other tests, preserving thread safety.

See the [Death Tests and Special Assertions](../reference/assertions.md#death) and [Writing and Managing Death Tests](../guides/writing-effective-tests/death-tests) documentation.

---

## Why These Concepts Matter

Mastering these core concepts helps you:

- Organize tests logically for maintainability
- Write robust assertions that give clear, informative feedback
- Share context and setup across related tests using fixtures
- Test code under varying inputs and data with parameterized tests
- Isolate dependencies and verify interactions accurately with mocks
- Detect fatal failures and program terminations safely with death tests

In practical terms, this means faster debugging, fewer flaky tests, better code quality, and higher confidence in your software.

<Accordion title="Common Pitfalls and Best Practices">

**Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same test suite:**

- GoogleTest requires all tests in the same suite to use the *same* fixture.
- Mixing plain `TEST` (no fixture) with `TEST_F` can cause confusing failures.

**Use `ASSERT_` when failure should abort the test early:**

- For example, ensure non-null pointers before dereference.

**Prefer `EXPECT_` for thorough testing:**

- Allows multiple assertions to run within the same test, catching more errors in one run.

**Mark broken or flaky tests as disabled:**

- Prefix test or test suite names with `DISABLED_` to temporarily exclude them.
- Use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` to selectively re-enable.

**Don’t put fatal assertions in constructors or destructors:**

- Fatal assertions abort the function, but constructors/destructors aren’t void-returning functions, causing compilation failures.
- Use `SetUp` and `TearDown` instead.

**Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context inside helper functions:**

- Makes failure messages include helpful trace info to identify where and why failures happen.

## Troubleshooting

- If tests fail without clear assertion failures, check if exceptions are caught with the `--gtest_catch_exceptions` flag.
- If your tests are not being discovered, verify naming conventions and that `InitGoogleTest` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS` are called properly.
- When using mocks, unexpected behaviors often occur if expectations are not set or cleared correctly; review mock setup carefully.
