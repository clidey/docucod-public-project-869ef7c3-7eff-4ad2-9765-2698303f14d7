# Who Should Use GoogleTest?

GoogleTest and GoogleMock stand as the premier C++ testing frameworks tailored for developers and teams seeking scalable, robust, and cross-platform solutions for unit testing and mocking. Understanding who benefits most from these tools empowers teams to maximize their productivity, test coverage, and code quality.

## Ideal Users

### C++ Developers Focused on Quality

GoogleTest is perfect for C++ developers who want to rigorously validate their code through automated unit and integration tests. Whether you're writing new code or maintaining existing systems, GoogleTest provides a powerful way to verify correctness incrementally.

### Teams Building Large or Complex Systems

For teams working on expansive codebases or enterprise applications, GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a scalable infrastructure to manage test suites efficiently. GoogleMock enhances your testing capabilities by enabling isolated interaction testing with dependencies via mocks.

### Developers Needing Cross-Platform Support

If your software spans multiple platforms or operating systems, GoogleTest offers consistent behavior and API across various environments, ensuring your tests run reliably everywhere.

### Contributors to Open-Source Projects

Open-source maintainers and contributors benefit from GoogleTest's widespread adoption and community support, making collaboration smoother with familiar testing conventions.

---

## Typical Use Cases

### Writing Reliable Unit Tests

GoogleTest gives you the ability to write clear and precise unit tests that assert specific behaviors, catching regressions early in the development cycle.

### Mocking Collaborators and Dependencies

With GoogleMock, you can create mock objects that simulate interfaces for dependencies, allowing you to test code in isolation and verify interactions.

### Testing Components Across Boundaries

GoogleTest supports parameterized and death tests, enabling sophisticated testing of components that interface with external resources or require fault injection.

### Ensuring Code Refactor Safety

By integrating GoogleTest into your development process, you can safely refactor with confidence, knowing that your tests will catch unintended side effects.
