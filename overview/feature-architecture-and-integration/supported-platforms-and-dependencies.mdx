# Supported Platforms & Dependencies

## Broad Platform and Compiler Support

GoogleTest is engineered with cross-platform robustness at its core. It runs seamlessly on a wide array of operating systems and hardware architectures, empowering developers to write and run C++ unit tests reliably in diverse environments.

Supported platforms include, but are not limited to:

- **Desktop Operating Systems:** Windows (including MinGW and various Windows Desktop editions), macOS, Linux distributions, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, and more.
- **Mobile and Embedded Systems:** iOS, Android (Linux-based Android), Windows Mobile, Windows RT, and specific embedded platforms like ESP32 and ESP8266.
- **Other Platforms:** Cygwin, QNX, Fuchsia, Haiku, GNU Hurd, and more specialized platforms.

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform at compile time through dedicated macros, ensuring platform-specific code paths are enabled or disabled as needed for correct behavior.

### Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler. It supports popular modern compilers such as:

- Microsoft Visual C++ (VS 2017 Update 3 and later)
- Clang
- GCC 7.0.0 and newer
- Intel LLVM
- SunPro
- IBM XL

This guarantees that you can build and link GoogleTest with modern development toolchains across supported platforms.

## Dependencies

### C++17 Standard Library

An environment capable of compiling C++17 code is a hard prerequisite. The C++17 standard enables GoogleTest to leverage language and library improvements essential for its internal implementation and your tests.

### Threading Support

- **Pthreads:** Where available (e.g., on most Unix-like systems), GoogleTest utilizes pthreads to support thread-safe testing operations like parallel test execution.
- **Windows Threads:** On Windows, GoogleTest uses native threading APIs.

Thread support is automatically detected and configured, ensuring thread safety in your tests when the environment allows.

If thread support is unavailable or undesired, users can disable it via build configuration macros, though this may limit concurrency-related features.

### Planned Abseil Integration

GoogleTest is progressively integrating components from the [Abseil](https://abseil.io) library, which provides modern C++ utility libraries and improved platform abstractions. This migration is designed to enhance platform support reliability and enable additional features such as:

- Advanced logging
- Improved flag handling
- Enhanced regular expression support (via RE2)

Integration with Abseil is currently in progress, and users can anticipate smoother compatibility and incremental feature enhancements in upcoming versions.

## Setup and Build Considerations

### Using CMake

GoogleTest includes a comprehensive CMake build script that simplifies cross-platform compilation. CMake automatically applies the correct compiler and linker flags tailored to your platform.

The build system handles:

- Defining compiler options that align with best practices for supported compilers (e.g., stricter warnings like `-W4` for MSVC).
- Choosing static or shared library builds.
- Linking to required threading libraries.

For example, on Windows, GoogleTest will, by default, link the runtime statically to avoid runtime duplication issues. This behavior can be overridden if necessary.

### Compiler Flags

The build scripts automatically add flags necessary for your environment, such as:

- Exception handling enabling or disabling.
- Run-time type information (RTTI) detection and configuration.
- Multi-threading macros.
- UTF-8 source encoding enforcement on MSVC.

### Cross-Platform File System Support

GoogleTest relies on file system capabilities for features like death tests and output capture. Most supported platforms provide compatible file system interfaces, although certain embedded or mobile platforms limit or disable this support.

## Policy Commitments

GoogleTest commits to maintaining broad platform support, with a focus on stability and performance in widely used environments. Community contributions are welcomed to enhance support for niche platforms.

The framework enables users to override default behaviors and extend compatibility through custom macros, allowing adjustments for unique build environments or limitations.

## Practical Tips

- Ensure your compiler and build environment meet C++17 requirements before integrating GoogleTest.
- When targeting platforms with limited threading or file system support, verify features like death tests and output capture for compatibility.
- Use the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` macro when building in environments without pthreads.
- Leverage CMake options such as `gtest_force_shared_crt` on Windows to control runtime linkage for compatibility with your project.

## Example: Basic CMake Setup Snippet
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyTests CXX)

# Fetch GoogleTest
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.17.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

# Define your test executable
add_executable(my_test test.cpp)

# Link with GoogleTest
target_link_libraries(my_test GTest::gtest_main)

# Enable C++17
set_target_properties(my_test PROPERTIES
  CXX_STANDARD 17
  CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED YES
  CXX_EXTENSIONS NO
)

# Enable testing and register tests
include(CTest)
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_test)
```

This snippet works across platforms supported by GoogleTest, handling compiler and dependency complexities automatically.

For detailed instructions on setting up your environment, refer to the [Installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows](../../getting-started/setup-requirements/install-platforms) page.

<Tip>
If your platform is not explicitly listed, try building GoogleTest with verbose output enabled to detect unsupported environment features or missing threading/file system support.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Building GoogleTest with a compiler or platform lacking proper C++17 or threading support will lead to compilation failures or runtime instabilities. Verify prerequisites carefully.
</Warning>
