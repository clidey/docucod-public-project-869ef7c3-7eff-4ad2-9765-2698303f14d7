# Quick Validation & Troubleshooting

This page helps you quickly verify that your GoogleTest installation and setup are correct, and troubleshoot common issues such as missing headers, linking errors, or incompatible build environments. Use the actionable checklist below to validate your environment and resolve frequent problems.

---

## 1. Verify Installation Files and Include Paths

- **Confirm GoogleTest Sources:** Ensure you have downloaded or cloned the GoogleTest repository correctly. Essential headers like `gtest/gtest.h` and libraries (e.g., `libgtest.a`, `libgmock.a` if applicable) should be present.

- **Check Include Directories:** Your build configuration must properly include the path to GoogleTest headers. For example, your compiler flags should have something like:

  ```bash
  -I/path/to/googletest/include
  ```

- **Troubleshooting Missing Headers:**
  - If your build fails due to missing headers, double-check your include path settings.
  - Verify that files such as `gtest/gtest.h` actually exist in the specified include directory.

## 2. Confirm Linking Correctness

- **Link With Correct Libraries:** Link your test executable against the GoogleTest libraries.
  - When using CMake, the recommended way is to link against the `gtest` and `gtest_main` targets.
  - For manual builds, ensure the linker flags point to compiled libraries like `-lgtest` and `-lpthread` (Linux) or their equivalents on other platforms.

- **Verify Library Versions:**
  - Confirm that you are linking against compatible versions of GoogleTest and your compiler.
  - Avoid mixing GoogleTest binaries built with different compiler versions or settings.

- **Troubleshooting Linker Errors:**
  - Typical errors include `undefined reference to testing::InitGoogleTest` or `RunAllTests`.
  - Verify that you are linking `gtest_main` if you rely on its default main(), or provide your own `main()` function correctly.

## 3. Validate Your Compiler and Toolchain Compatibility

- **C++17 Requirement:** GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler.
  - Ensure your compiler version supports C++17.
  - Set your compiler flags accordingly, e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang.

- **Platform Compatibility:**
  - GoogleTest supports Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
  - Check your platform-specific instructions if you experience issues.

- **Resolving Incompatibility Issues:**
  - Update your compiler or switch to a supported version.
  - Adjust build flags to adhere to GoogleTest requirements.

## 4. Basic Functionality Test

Create a minimal test file to verify your setup works:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple test example
TEST(SanityTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Build and Run:

- Compile with your usual C++ compiler and link with GoogleTest libraries.
- Run the resulting executable; you should see test results with no errors.

If this simple test fails to compile or run, retrace your installation and linking steps.

## 5. Common Troubleshooting Tips

### Missing Headers

- Ensure your `#include` statements use angle brackets, e.g. `#include <gtest/gtest.h>`.
- Confirm include paths are specified before compiling.
- Check for typos in include paths or filenames.

### Linking Errors

- Confirm you include the path to GoogleTest library binaries in your linker settings.
- Make sure you link the `gtest_main` library if you don't have your own `main()`.
- On Linux, ensure you link with `-pthread`.

### Incompatible Compiler or Environment

- Use a sufficiently new compiler that supports C++17.
- Double-check cross-compilation environments to ensure all dependencies are met.

### Runtime Failures

- Review test output for specific assertion failures.
- Use GoogleTest's verbose output flags (e.g., `--gtest_verbose=info`) for more detailed diagnostics.

### Common Pitfalls

- Calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` more than once is not supported.
- Ignoring the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` will cause compiler errors.
- Avoid naming test suites or test names with underscores; use CamelCase to avoid filtering issues.

## 6. Useful Diagnostic Commands

### Validate Compiler and Linker Flags

Example with GCC:

```bash
# Compile your test file
g++ -std=c++17 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread \ 
    test_file.cc /path/to/libgtest.a /path/to/libgtest_main.a -o test_executable

# Run the tests
./test_executable
```

### Check GoogleTest Version

If you have built GoogleTest as a library, you can check the version with:

```bash
gtest-config --version
```

(if available).

### Run GoogleTest with Flags

```bash
./test_executable --gtest_list_tests            # Lists all tests
./test_executable --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*   # Runs tests in MyTestSuite
./test_executable --gtest_break_on_failure       # Breaks on first failure
```

## 7. Getting Help and Support

- Visit the [GoogleTest Primer](/docs/primer.md) for a thorough introduction.
- Refer to the [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md) and [Installation Guides](installation_with_cmake.md, installation_with_bazel.md) for setup assistance.
- Consult the [Mocking Cookbook](gmock_cook_book.md) for mocking topics.
- Use the GoogleTest community resources and issue tracker at the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).

<Tip>
If you encounter issues that you cannot resolve, enabling verbose logging can provide detailed insights:

```bash
./test_executable --gtest_verbose=info
```

This will print detailed event information and help pinpoint problems.

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Missing `gtest/gtest.h`

- Cause: The include path is not specified or incorrect.
- Fix: Add `-I/path/to/googletest/include` to compiler flags.

### Linker errors for `InitGoogleTest` or `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

- Cause: Not linking with `gtest` or `gtest_main` libraries.
- Fix: Add `-lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread` (Linux) or proper equivalents.

### Compiler errors related to C++ version

- Cause: Compiler does not support C++17.
- Fix: Upgrade compiler or add `-std=c++17`.

### Tests not running, or unknown test cases

- Cause: Test executable not built properly or linking issues.
- Fix: Recompile with proper linking, confirm test code is compiled.

### Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return value

- Ensure your `main()` returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, for example:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` multiple times or ignoring its result causes errors.
