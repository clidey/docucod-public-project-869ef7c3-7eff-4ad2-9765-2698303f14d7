# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Understanding the prerequisites and supported environments is the essential first step before installing and using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide clarifies the minimum platform requirements, compiler compatibility, supported C++ standards, and common dependencies to prepare your development environment confidently.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to run cross-platform, supporting the following major operating systems:

- **Linux** (most distributions)
- **Windows** (including Windows 7 and later)
- **macOS**

This broad compatibility ensures you can run GoogleTest/GoogleMock on nearly any development machine.

> 
> This support aligns with GoogleTest’s philosophy of portability and platform-neutral testing.


## 2. Supported C++ Standards

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a minimum of **C++11** standard support. Most modern compilers fully meet this requirement. Using C++11 or later is critical because GoogleTest and GoogleMock utilize language features introduced in this version for improved safety and expressiveness.


## 3. Compiler Compatibility

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support the following compilers:

- **GCC** (version 4.8 or later recommended)
- **Clang** (version 3.3 or later recommended)
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)** (Visual Studio 2015 or later recommended)


### Tips for Compiler Setup

- Ensure your compiler flags enable **C++11** or higher standards (e.g., `-std=c++11`, `/std:c++14`).
- When mixing GoogleTest/GoogleMock with other libraries, ensure consistent C++ standard flags across builds.
- On MSVC, consider disabling warnings 4100 (unreferenced formal parameters) as GoogleMock code disables it internally to reduce noise.


## 4. Build System Integration & Tools

Though this guide focuses on prerequisites, be aware that GoogleTest and GoogleMock work well with modern build systems, including but not limited to:

- **CMake**
- **Bazel**

Familiarity with your project’s build system installation and configuration process will ease later integration.


## 5. Common Dependencies

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are header-only and source-based libraries that generally have minimal external dependencies:

- **Standard C++ Library** (matches your compiler and platform)
- **POSIX Features** (on Unix-like systems, which are generally available)
- Thread support is beneficial but GoogleTest attempts to be thread-safe on supported platforms.


## 6. Access and Permissions

- You will need access to the internet or your internal source control to download or clone the GoogleTest GitHub repository: [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Ensure you have permission to build and link C++ test binaries on your platform.


## 7. Network and Environment Considerations

GoogleTest and GoogleMock do not require network access during runtime. For building and fetching dependencies (if using external package managers), confirm that your firewall or proxy settings allow connections to GitHub or your package registries.

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

### Compiler Does Not Support C++11 or Later

- **Solution:** Upgrade to a recent compiler version or adjust flags.
- Double-check your project's build flags. For example, GCC requires `-std=c++11` or higher.

### OS Not Supported or Environment Incompatible

- GoogleTest/GoogleMock rely on POSIX or Windows APIs; exotic or embedded systems without these may not be supported.
- Check for updates or community ports if targeting unusual platforms.

### Permission Issues

- Lack of compile or write permissions will block installation.
- Contact your administrator or adjust permissions accordingly.

## Summary

By ensuring your development environment meets these prerequisites, you set the foundation for a successful installation and usage of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Start by verifying your OS, compiler version, and C++ standard support, then prepare your build system and source environment.

For detailed step-by-step installation instructions, see the [Installation & Build Integration](../essentials_setup/installation.md) page.

<Tip>
Preparing your toolchain to support at least C++11 and a supported compiler version removes the most common blockers to using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
</Tip>

<Note>
While GoogleTest aims for broad platform support, some legacy or very new platforms might require additional configuration or patches.
</Note>

<Warning>
Using an unsupported or untested compiler can cause build failures or unexpected runtime issues.
</Warning>

## Example Verification

After preparing your environment, verify by querying your compiler version and C++ standard support:

```bash
# GCC example
gcc --version
gcc -std=c++11 -E - < /dev/null  # check no errors for C++11

# Clang example
clang --version
clang -std=c++11 -E - < /dev/null

# MSVC example (Developer Command Prompt)
cl
# Check Visual Studio version and C++ standard support
```

You should then be confident to proceed with downloading and building GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
