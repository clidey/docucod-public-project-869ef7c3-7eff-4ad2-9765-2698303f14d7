# Prerequisites & Requirements

## Supported C++ Standards

GoogleTest requires a build environment that supports **C++17** or later. Ensure your compiler and standard library provide full conformance to C++17 features. This compliance guarantees compatibility and stability for your tests.

## Supported Platforms and Toolchains

GoogleTest supports a wide range of operating systems and compilers including, but not limited to:

- Linux (with GCC and Clang)
- Windows (MSVC)
- macOS (Clang)
- BSD variants

Support for embedded platforms and less common toolchains may be limited or experimental. For detailed platform support, refer to the official [Supported Platforms & Compatibility](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/overview/integration-platforms/platform-support.md) documentation.

## Compiler Requirements

- Must be compatible with C++17.
- Should support all required compiler features used by GoogleTest and GoogleMock (e.g., templates, variadic templates, constexpr).
- Thread support (POSIX pthreads or equivalent) is recommended for parallel and multi-threaded tests.

## Build Environment

GoogleTest uses CMake as its primary build system. Ensure you have:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.14 or later installed for smooth building and integration.
- A compatible build toolchain (e.g., `make`, Visual Studio, Ninja).

For embedded, specialized, or legacy environments, consult platform-specific guides.

## Checking Your Local System

Before building or integrating GoogleTest, verify:

1. Your compiler version supports C++17.
2. Your system toolchain is correctly installed and accessible.
3. Required build tools like CMake are installed.

Example check commands:

```bash
# Check GCC version
gcc --version

# Check Clang version
clang --version

# Check CMake version
cmake --version

# Check MSVC (Visual Studio) version
cl
```

## Notes on Platform Support

- Some platforms may require additional setup or dependencies.
- Windows users should be aware of dynamic vs static runtime linkage, which affects linking GoogleTest. See [Visual Studio Dynamic vs Static Runtimes](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting_started/intro_and_setup/installation_options.md#visual-studio-runtime) for details.
- Cross-compiling GoogleTest is generally not recommended but possible with careful configuration.

## Where to Find More Details

- [Supported Platforms & Compatibility](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/overview/integration-platforms/platform-support.md)
- [Building and Installation Instructions](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting_started/intro_and_setup/installation_options.md)
- [GoogleTest Build and Toolchain Recommendations](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/overview/integration-platforms/integration-other-systems.md)

<Tip>
Always ensure your build environment meets the required C++ standard and platform support before integrating GoogleTest to prevent build or runtime issues.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using an unsupported or partially supported toolchain can lead to compilation errors and unstable test behavior.
</Warning>

<Check>
Run test compilations on your target platform early in your integration workflow.
</Check>

## Summary

This page outlines the minimum C++17 compatibility, supported compilers, platforms, and environment prerequisites necessary to build and use GoogleTest effectively. It emphasizes verifying the user's local build setup and points to the detailed platform support and setup documentation for specific instructions and troubleshooting.

---

### Example: Verifying Compiler Support

```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
g++ -std=c++17 --version

# On Windows using MSVC:
cl
```

Ensure the output indicates support for C++17 or later.

### Example: Checking CMake Version

```bash
cmake --version
```

GoogleTest requires CMake 3.14 or above for native builds.

<Note>
GoogleTest and GoogleMock are bundled together and share the same prerequisites and platform compatibility.
</Note>

# Next Steps

After confirming your environment meets these prerequisites, proceed to the [Installation & Build Options](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting_started/intro_and_setup/installation_options.md) to build and integrate GoogleTest.

<Check>
Follow the installation guide carefully to avoid linker or runtime failures due to mismatched compiler or build settings.
