# Quick Validation Checklist

Follow this streamlined checklist to confirm that your installation of GoogleTest and GoogleMock is successful and ready for reliable use in your C++ projects.

---

## 1. Verify Installation and Version

Ensure that the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries are properly installed and that the versions match your expectations.

### Steps:

- Locate the installed libraries and headers in your project or system.
- Verify version via the command line or by checking the headers (e.g., `gtest/gtest.h` or `gmock/gmock.h`).
- Example (if integration provides a version macro or command):
  ```bash
  # Not all builds support command-line version queries; alternatively, check git tag in repo
  grep "VERSION" path/to/gtest/include/gtest/gtest.h
  ```
  Or check the main test output for version info.

### Success criteria:

- The libraries exist in your project's include and lib paths.
- Version matches the intended release (compare with GitHub repository `main` branch or your chosen release).

---

## 2. Build and Run Example Tests

Use the provided example or your own minimal test to build and run, verifying that GoogleTest and GoogleMock execute tests as expected.

### Example Test File (Minimal):

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::Return;

// Simple interface to mock
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}
  virtual int GetId() = 0;
};

// Mock class using GoogleMock
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetId, (), (override));
};

// Basic test to verify mocking behavior
TEST(SimpleMockTest, ReturnsExpectedValue) {
  MockFoo mock_foo;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, GetId()).WillOnce(Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_foo.GetId(), 42);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Compile and run:

- **Build command example (using g++ and pkg-config):**
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++11 -isystem /path/to/googletest/include -pthread \
      your_test.cc /path/to/libgmock.a /path/to/libgtest.a -o your_test
  ```

- Run:
  ```bash
  ./your_test
  ```

### Expected Output:

- Test should pass successfully.
- No warnings or errors related to mock function calls.
- Output similar to:
  ```
  [==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
  [----------] Global test environment set-up.
  [----------] 1 test from SimpleMockTest
  [ RUN      ] SimpleMockTest.ReturnsExpectedValue
  [       OK ] SimpleMockTest.ReturnsExpectedValue (0 ms)
  [----------] 1 test from SimpleMockTest (0 ms total)
  [----------] Global test environment tear-down
  [==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
  [  PASSED  ] 1 test.
  ```

## 3. Inspect Standard Warning and Behavior Messages

Understand and confirm the default behavior of mock calls, warnings, and test outputs.

### Key Points:

- By default, calling a mock method without `EXPECT_CALL` set will generate a warning "Uninteresting mock function call." This is expected unless using `NiceMock`.
- If `EXPECT_CALL` is set but the call arguments do not match, a test failure occurs.
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag to increase or decrease verbosity.

### Tip:

- Suppress unwanted warnings by using `NiceMock` or specifying `.Times(AnyNumber())` on an `EXPECT_CALL`.

---

## 4. Verify Your Project Integration

Confirm your project successfully links and runs tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

### Steps:

- Include necessary headers:
  ```cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>
  #include <gmock/gmock.h>
  ```
- Link against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.
- Confirm that both `InitGoogleMock` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` are called in your test `main`.

### Verify:

- Your build system properly finds and links GoogleTest/GoogleMock.
- Tests compile and run correctly.
- No linker errors related to mocking or GoogleTest.

---

## 5. Additional Verification and Troubleshooting Tips

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to gain detailed call matching insights.
- Check for correct ordering of expectations and calls.
- Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object);` to force verification before object destruction if needed.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://google.github.io/googletest/getting_started/first_steps_usage/common_issues) guide if you encounter problems.

# Summary

This checklist guides you through verifying your GoogleTest and GoogleMock setup by confirming installation, successfully building and running an example test that includes mocks, and validating expected behavior and outputs. It emphasizes understanding the default warning system and ensuring your project correctly integrates with the testing libraries.
