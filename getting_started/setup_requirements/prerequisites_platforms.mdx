# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Ensure your development environment aligns with GoogleTest's foundational support policies to enjoy a seamless and reliable testing experience. This page comprehensively outlines the officially supported platforms, compilers, and C++ standard requirements, enabling you to avoid compatibility challenges before installation.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest is designed to be cross-platform and supports a wide range of operating systems following Google's [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support). The core supported OS families include:

- **Windows** (desktop editions, with special notes on MinGW and mobile versions)
- **Linux** (including Android flavors and several BSD variants)
- **macOS** and **iOS**
- **FreeBSD**, **NetBSD**, **OpenBSD**, **DragonFlyBSD**
- **Solaris**, **AIX**, **HP-UX**, **Fuchsia**, **QNX**, **GNU/Hurd**

> For a detailed and current list of all supported platforms and compiler versions, consult the [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md).

### Platform Detection Macros

GoogleTest automatically detects the platform at compile time, defining macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, and `GTEST_OS_MAC`. These are useful for advanced users writing platform-specific tests or customizations.

## 2. Compiler Support and Requirements

GoogleTest mandates compilation with a C++17-compliant compiler, reflecting modern C++ best practices. Supported compilers include but are not limited to:

- **MS Visual C++ 2017 Update 3 and later** (at least Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3)+
- **GCC 7.0 and later**
- **Clang 3.4.1 and later**
- **Intel LLVM Compiler** with corresponding support
- **Sun Pro**, **IBM Visual Age**, and **HP aCC** compilers with necessary features

### C++ Standard Required

GoogleTest requires **C++17** or higher. This ensures access to necessary language features such as `std::string_view`, `std::optional`, and enhanced template capabilities.

Configure your build system accordingly, for example by adding the following in your CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

Or by specifying appropriate compiler flags if not using CMake (e.g., `-std=c++17` for GCC/Clang).

## 3. Threading and Synchronization Support

GoogleTest is fully thread-safe when built on systems with threading support. Thread safety is detected via the availability of pthreads or native threading implementations on Windows.

- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` macro indicates pthread support.
- The build system automatically adds necessary flags for threading libraries.

If your environment doesn't correctly auto-detect pthread support, manually define:

```bash
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1  # to enable
-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0  # to disable
```

## 4. Regular Expression Engines

GoogleTest supports multiple regex engines depending on platform capabilities:

- **RE2**: When compiled with Abseil (Absl) library support
- **POSIX Extended Regex**: Default on most Unix-like systems
- **Simple Regex**: A reduced subset for other platforms like Windows

This selection is automatic and requires no action unless customization is desired.

## 5. File System and Stream Redirection

GoogleTest requires file system support and stream redirection features for output capture and death tests.

Platforms without file system support or with limited stream redirection (e.g., Windows Mobile, embedded systems like ESP8266) are partially supported or unsupported in this regard.

## 6. Minimum Platform Versions (Summary)

| Component          | Minimum Supported Version                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Windows Visual C++ | Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (MSVC 19.11)   |
| GCC                | 7.0 or later                               |
| Clang              | 3.4.1 or later                             |
| C++ Standard       | C++17                                      |

> Failure to meet these requirements will cause compilation errors or unpredictable behavior.

## 8. Practical Tips

- **Check your compiler version** before building GoogleTest. Use `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or the appropriate Visual Studio version info.
- **Ensure C++17 is enabled** in your build configuration.
- Prefer building GoogleTest using **CMake**, which handles platform detection and flags.
- For Windows users, if encountering runtime library mismatch issues, consider enabling the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to harmonize CRT linkage.
- On Linux and Unix-like systems, verify that `pthread` is available and properly linked.

<AccordionGroup title="Common Platform and Compiler Issues">
<Accordion title="Build fails due to unsupported compiler version">

Verify that your compiler supports C++17 and meets minimum versions. Upgrade GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio if needed.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Runtime library mismatch errors on Windows">

Enable `gtest_force_shared_crt` in your CMake command line to align runtime linkage.

```bash
cmake .. -Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Pthread not found errors on Linux">

Ensure `pthread` development libraries are installed. Install packages like `libpthread-stubs0-dev` or `glibc-devel` depending on your distro.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="C++17 features not recognized">

Make sure your build system passes `-std=c++17` or equivalent flag to the compiler.

## Appendix: Example - Checking Compiler Version (Linux/macOS)

```bash
gcc --version
clang --version
```

Make sure the output indicates version 7.0+ for GCC or 3.4.1+ for Clang.

## Appendix: Example - Enabling C++17 in CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyTestProject LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(my_test my_test.cpp)
```
