# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

This page details the essential prerequisites, supported platforms, and system requirements for using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. Before installing or integrating the frameworks, ensure your development environment meets these criteria to guarantee successful builds and smooth operation.

---

## 1. Minimum System Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock require a modern development environment to function correctly. Confirm that your system meets the following baseline before proceeding:

- **Operating Systems Supported:** 
  - Linux distributions
  - Windows (Desktop, including MinGW)
  - Mac OS X

- **Processor Architecture:** 
  - x86, x64 are fully supported
  - Other architectures may have partial support depending on compiler and OS

- **Memory and Storage:** 
  - At minimum, 1 GB RAM recommended for typical development
  - Sufficient disk space for source checkout and build files (~100 MB)


## 2. Language and Compiler Requirements

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are C++ testing frameworks that require specific compiler capabilities.

- **C++ Standard Version:**
  - The environment must support at least **C++17**.
  - This is enforced at compile-time and build scripts typically set this standard explicitly.

- **Supported Compilers and Versions:**

  The frameworks follow Google's Foundational C++ Support Policy. See the external policy table [here](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for detailed compiler-version support.

  Common supported compilers include:
  
  - GCC 7.1 and later
  - Clang 5.0 and later
  - MSVC 2017 (version 19.11+) and later

- **Compiler Flags and Settings:**
  - The compiler must be configured to use C++17 standard features.
  - For example, using CMake, the recommended configuration is:

    ```cmake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
    ```

  - It is also possible to specify relevant flags directly, e.g., `-std=c++17`.

- **Exception and RTTI Support:**
  - Exceptions are supported but the frameworks do not use exceptions internally.
  - RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) is optional but enabled by default if your compiler supports it.


## 3. Supported Platforms Details

GoogleTest and GoogleMock automatically detect and support a variety of platforms via a set of macros. These macros are internally defined but indicate which operating systems are supported. The primary platforms with stable support include:

- **Linux** (including common distributions and Android)
- **Windows Desktop** (including native Windows and MinGW environments)
- **Mac OS X and iOS**

Less common platforms with some support include:

- FreeBSD
- OpenBSD
- Solaris
- AIX
- NetBSD

Embedded or mobile platforms have limited support and may lack features such as stream redirection or file system access.


## 4. Verifying Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to validate that your environment meets the necessary prerequisites before installation or integration.

### Step 1: Check C++ Compiler Version

Run your compiler with the version flag. For example:

```bash
# GCC
gcc --version

# Clang
clang --version

# MSVC (Developer Command Prompt)
cl
```

Confirm that the version is compatible with C++17 support.

### Step 2: Confirm C++17 Support

Try to compile a minimal C++ program with the `-std=c++17` flag (or equivalent) to ensure support.

Example source `test.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  if constexpr(sizeof(int) == 4) { std::cout << "C++17 supported!" << std::endl; }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 test.cpp -o test
./test
```

It should compile and output successfully.

### Step 3: Verify Platform Macro Detection (Optional)

If you want to confirm the platform macro checks done by the framework, you can review platform definitions in `gtest-port-arch.h` and `gmock-port.h` headers, which detect your environment during compilation.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Tips

- **Older Compiler Versions:** Attempting to build with compilers earlier than those supporting C++17 will fail with errors. Upgrade your compiler or adjust your toolchain accordingly.

- **C++ Standard Not Set:** If you forget to set the minimum standard (e.g., `-std=c++14`), compilation will fail with explicit errors about unsupported features.

- **Platform Differences:** Certain features or behavior (like death tests or stream redirection) may not be supported on embedded/mobile platforms. Consult the platform support matrix accordingly.

- **Windows Compiler Compatibility:** For MSVC, version must be at least VS2017 Update 3 or newer.

- **Multi-threading Support:** Google Test is thread-safe on platforms with pthread; if using Windows, certain pthread-specific features are mapped to Windows threading.

<Tip>
To avoid compiler version related issues, regularly check and update your toolchain. Googleâ€™s foundational C++ support documentation link is a valuable resource for supported environments: [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).

## 6. Summary

Before integrating or installing GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- Validate your system platform is supported (Linux, Windows Desktop, Mac).
- Ensure you have an up-to-date C++17 capable compiler.
- Configure your build system to enforce C++17 standard.
- Recognize platform-specific limitations.

By meeting these prerequisites, you affirm a robust foundation for proceeding confidently with installation and usage.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
The frameworks enforce a **strict minimum C++17** standard; environments using older standards will not compile. If you encounter compiler errors about language features, verify your compiler's standard version flags.

<Callout title="Tip" type="tip">
On Windows with Visual Studio, ensure you are using Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later for full compatibility with GoogleMock requirements.
