# System Requirements

This page outlines the essential prerequisites to use **GoogleTest**, ensuring your development environment meets the minimum standards for compiling, running, and debugging tests effectively with this C++ testing framework.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Version

GoogleTest requires a modern C++ environment supporting **C++17**. This standard version brings necessary language and library features that GoogleTest depends on for its core functionality.

### How to ensure C++17 support:

- When using **CMake**, add the following commands to your top-level `CMakeLists.txt` to request C++17:
  
  ```cmake
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
  ```

- If you're using a custom build setup or a compiler command line, specify the appropriate flags:
  
  - For GCC and Clang: `-std=c++17`
  - For MSVC (Visual Studio 2017 and later): The default compiler settings generally support C++17, but you can explicitly set `/std:c++17`.


## 2. Compatible Compilers

GoogleTest supports a wide range of compilers on major platforms, but some minimum versions are required to guarantee compatibility.

| Compiler            | Minimum Version Required         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** | 7.0 or newer               |
| **Clang**           | 5.0 or newer                    |
| **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**    | Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 19.11) |

### Special Notes:
- For **Visual C++**, users must use MSVC 2015 (14.0) or newer to ensure GoogleMock compatibility.
- Older or unsupported compilers may compile GoogleTest but can exhibit unstable behavior or missing features.

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest runs on all mainstream development platforms:

- **Linux** (various distributions)
- **Windows** (Desktop, including MinGW)
- **Mac OS X**

Additionally, GoogleTest supports some less common or embedded platforms when properly configured, but user experience may vary.

## 4. Threading and Concurrency Support

- GoogleTest is **thread-safe** on platforms where the POSIX pthread library is available.
- On platforms lacking pthreads, thread safety for assertions may not be guaranteed, so tests should avoid concurrent assertions.

### How to ensure pthread support:
- If GoogleTest does not auto-detect pthread, define the macro at compile time:

  ```cpp
  -DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1
  ```

- If using your own build scripts, link with the pthread library explicitly (e.g., `-lpthread`).

## 5. Dependencies

- **C++ Standard Library**: GoogleTest depends on the C++ standard library implementation compatible with C++17.
- **Optional** (but recommended):
  - **Abseil**: If present, GoogleTest uses Abseil's utilities for flag parsing and other features.
  - **RE2**: For advanced regular expression matching if Abseil is configured.


## 6. Platform and Environment Macros

GoogleTest internally defines macros to detect and adjust for platform-specific details such as file system availability, wide string support, and exception support.

**Key macros include:**
- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` - exception support available
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` - runtime type information enabled
- `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM` - file system availability
- `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE` - POSIX regex support


## 7. Build and Linkage Requirements

### Runtime Library Consistency
- When building with **Visual Studio**, ensure that the C runtime linkage is consistent between GoogleTest and your project:
  - If your project links the C runtime dynamically (`/MD`), enable the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to make GoogleTest do the same.

### Multi-threading
- Enable threading support explicitly when necessary.

### Shared vs Static Libraries
- GoogleTest can be built as a **static** or **shared** library. 
- To build as a shared library, define:
  
  ```cpp
  -DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  ```

- To link your tests with the shared library, define:

  ```cpp
  -DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1
  ```


## 8. Avoiding Macro Name Conflicts

GoogleTest defines many macros for assertions and test scaffolding that may conflict with other libraries.

- To rename GoogleTest macros and avoid conflicts, define a macro of the form `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO>=1`, which means GoogleTest will rename `MACRO` to `GTEST_MACRO`. For example:

  ```cpp
  -DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
  ```

- Then you use `GTEST_TEST()` instead of `TEST()` to declare tests.


## 9. Summary Checklist Before You Begin

Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- [ ] Compiler supports C++17 (GCC ≥7, Clang ≥5, MSVC 2017 or newer)
- [ ] Compatible platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X)
- [ ] Threading library (pthreads) if running multi-threaded tests
- [ ] Consistent runtime libraries when mixing with Visual Studio
- [ ] Resolve any macro name clashes or define renaming macros as necessary

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Issues

### Build Fails with Older Compiler
- Upgrade your compiler to meet the minimum version requirements.

### Runtime Link Errors on Windows
- Confirm matching linkage modes for runtime library (static vs dynamic).

### Thread-Safety Warnings
- Verify pthread support and linkage on non-Windows platforms.

### Macro Conflicts
- Use `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO>=1` to avoid clashes.
