# Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Ensure a smooth installation and operation of GoogleTest by meeting the following minimum system requirements and supported platform criteria. This guide clearly outlines essential compiler versions, operating systems, and development tools necessary to build and use GoogleTest effectively.

---

## 1. System Requirements

### Supported C++ Standard
- **C++17 or higher is required.** GoogleTest mandates an environment supporting at least the C++17 standard.
- To enforce the standard in your build system (e.g., CMake), explicitly set the C++ standard:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

### Compilers
GoogleTest supports a broad range of compilers that are compliant with C++17. Refer to the [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support) and the detailed [Supported Platforms Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) for exact versions.

Notable supported compilers include:
- GCC (version supporting C++17)
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 (or later)
- Intel LLVM
- Others per platform documentation

### Operating Systems
GoogleTest runs reliably on the following platforms:
- **Linux:** including various distributions
- **Windows:** Desktop versions (including MinGW)
- **macOS:** current and recent versions
- BSD variants including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- Others such as Solaris, AIX, QNX per community support

Support for embedded/mobile platforms is limited or unavailable.

### Build Tools and Tools Integration
- Build is commonly managed via CMake or Bazel.
- CMake minimum version recommended is **3.14** when using advanced features like `FetchContent`.
- On Unix-like systems, the `make` utility or Ninja can be used.
- Windows users often build with Visual Studio solutions generated by CMake.

### Multi-threading and Exception Support
- GoogleTest is thread-safe where pthreads are available (typical on POSIX platforms).
- On Windows, thread safety is supported via native system threading primitives.
- Exception handling must be enabled in your compiler to avoid build issues.

## 2. Essential Dependencies

### Required Software
- **C++17-compliant compiler** (see above).
- **Build system:**
  - [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for native builds.
  - [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) for Bazel-based projects.
- Development environment for your platform (e.g., Visual Studio, Xcode).

### Optional Components
- **Abseil and RE2 libraries** if opting to build GoogleTest with `GTEST_HAS_ABSL=ON` for improved regex support.

### Network and File System
- File system access must be available for full GoogleTest feature support, including death tests and logging.

---

## 3. Platform Compatibility Notes

### Macros and Feature Tweaking
- GoogleTest adapts automatically to your platform but allows manual overriding of features via compiler defines such as:
  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` to force pthread detection.
  - `-DGTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` to compile GoogleTest as a shared library.
  - `-DGTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY=1` when linking tests against a shared GoogleTest library.

### Runtime Library Considerations on Windows
- Microsoft Visual Studio projects by default link the C runtime dynamically.
- GoogleTest static builds link to the CRT statically by default, which can cause linker errors.
- Resolve this by passing `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` in your CMake configuration to align runtimes.

### Avoiding Macro Conflicts
- If GoogleTest macros conflict with other libraries (e.g., `TEST()` macro), rename locally by disabling the macro definition:

```bash
-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_TEST=1
```
Then use the prefixed macros like `GTEST_TEST()`.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

### Compiler Does Not Support C++17
- Verify compiler and version.
- Update to a supported compiler version.
- Explicitly enable C++17 standard in compiler/build flags.

### Build Tool Version Too Low
- Upgrade CMake to at least version 3.14 for best feature support.

### Missing pthread or Threading Support
- On Linux/macOS, ensure pthread development headers are installed.
- For custom builds, define `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` or `0` manually to override detection.

### Visual Studio Linker Runtime Library Conflicts
- Use CMake option `-Dgtest_force_shared_crt=ON` to harmonize runtimes.

### Macro Name Collisions
- Use `-DGTEST_DONT_DEFINE_<MACRO>=1` for conflicting macros as documented.

By confirming these requirements upfront, you guarantee a reliable foundation for building and running GoogleTest across supported systems. For platform-specific nuances and deeper integration details, consult related platform and build system documentation.
