# Verifying Your Installation

Ensure the success of your GoogleTest and GoogleMock installation with straightforward verification steps that confirm the framework is correctly built, configured, and ready for your C++ testing workflows. This guide walks you through compiling a simple test executable, running it, and interpreting the results to confidently proceed with writing your tests and mocks.

---

## 1. Build a Simple Test Executable

To verify that GoogleTest and GoogleMock are installed correctly, the first step is to compile a test program that exercises their basic functionality.

### Step 1: Create a Minimal Test Source File

Create a file named `sample_test.cc` with the following code. It implements a trivial test case using GoogleTest and GoogleMock APIs.

```cpp
#include "gmock/gmock.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

// Simple test to verify installation
TEST(InstallationTest, BasicAssertion) {
    EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This test includes the core headers and runs a single assertion that must pass.

### Step 2: Compile the Test

Assuming you have installed the frameworks using CMake and your compiler is configured, compile the test as follows.

For example, with `g++` and pkg-config:

```sh
pkg-config --cflags --libs gmock_main

# Compile command (adjust paths if needed):
g++ -std=c++17 sample_test.cc -o sample_test $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gmock_main)
```

This links your test executable against `gmock_main`, which includes GoogleMock and GoogleTest with the main entry point.

> If you built GoogleTest and GoogleMock from source manually, ensure you link against both libraries and their dependencies.

### Step 3: Run the Test Executable

Execute the compiled binary:

```sh
./sample_test
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Running main() from gmock_main.cc
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from InstallationTest
[ RUN      ] InstallationTest.BasicAssertion
[       OK ] InstallationTest.BasicAssertion (0 ms)
[----------] 1 test from InstallationTest ran. (0 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
```

This confirms the framework can compile, link, and run tests.

## 2. Understanding Expected Results

### Successful Output

- The line `Running main() from gmock_main.cc` indicates the main function from GoogleMock was invoked.
- Test results show your test case running and passing.
- `[  PASSED  ] 1 test` summary confirms no failures.

### Common Output Notes

- If you see tests failing, ensure your source code and linking steps are correct.
- Warnings about missing pthread support or related flags may require adjusting build options.

## 3. Troubleshooting Verification Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues in Installation Verification">
<Accordion title="Linker Errors or Missing Symbols">
Check that your compile and link commands include `-lgmock_main` and related libraries. Without linking the main library, you will see errors related to missing `main()` or test symbols.

<Note>
If you built GoogleTest/GoogleMock manually, verify installation paths and `pkg-config` files are correct.
</Note>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Test Executable Runs but Finds No Tests">
If the output shows:

```
[==========] 0 tests from 0 test cases ran.
```

ensure that the test source file includes test definitions correctly and that `InitGoogleMock` is called before running tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Fails Due to Missing Headers or Libraries">
Confirm the include paths point to the installed GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers. Adjust the compiler flags if necessary, especially with custom installations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Multi-threading or Pthread Issues">
On some systems, you may need to explicitly link pthreads by adding `-pthread` or `-lpthread`.

Check if you built with the `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` flag if your environment supports it.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use `gmock_main` for quick startup tests:** Linking against `gmock_main` includes a ready-to-use `main()` to avoid writing it yourself.
- **Verify version consistency:** Ensure `gtest` and `gmock` versions match, particularly when using pkg-config or manual installs.
- **Run with verbose flags:** You can run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` or `--gmock_verbose=warning` to get more detailed output to troubleshoot.

```sh
./sample_test --gmock_verbose=info
```

- **Keep your build system updated:** Using frameworks like CMake with the provided configurations is recommended to avoid manual errors.

## 5. Next Steps

After verifying your installation:

- Proceed to [Writing and Running Your First Test](/getting_started/first_test_and_validation/writing_first_test) to learn how to author tests with GoogleTest.
- Explore [Getting Started with GoogleMock](/getting_started/first_test_and_validation/using_googlemock_basics) to write your first mocks and understand core mocking concepts.
- Visit [Common Installation Issues](/getting_started/troubleshooting/common_install_issues) if you encounter problems not resolved here.
