# Run and Validate Your Tests

This guide shows you how to build and execute your initial test suite using GoogleTest and GoogleMock, interpret test output, and quickly confirm successful integration. By following these steps, you will obtain immediate, actionable results demonstrating that GoogleTest is correctly integrated into your development environment.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Preparation

Before running your tests, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **GoogleTest and GoogleMock are installed and built** properly on your system.
- Your build environment can compile test binaries correctly.
- You have access to your test binaries or executables, which include GoogleTest-based tests.
- Familiarity with basic command-line usage to execute tests.

If you have not installed GoogleTest or GoogleMock yet, please refer to the [System Requirements](../requirements_installation/system_requirements) and [Installation with CMake or Bazel](../requirements_installation/installation_cmake) guides.

---

## 2. Build Your Initial Test Suite

You need to build or compile your test suite that includes GoogleTest tests. Typically, this involves compiling your test source files with the GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries linked.

### 2.1 Compile Your Test Code

Depending on your build system, compile your test target. For example:

- Using CMake:

```bash
cmake --build build_directory --target your_test_target
```

- Using Bazel:

```bash
bazel build //path/to:your_test_target
```

### 2.2 Verify Compilation Success

Ensure the build completes without errors and produces a test executable.

### Troubleshooting Tip

If the build fails, check that GoogleTest include paths and libraries are correctly referenced, and that your compiler supports the required C++ standard (C++17 or higher).

---

## 3. Execute Your Test Suite

Once built, run the test executable to trigger all tests.

### 3.1 Run Your Test Binary

From the command line, execute:

```bash
./path_to_your_test_executable
```

On Windows, it might be:

```powershell
path_to_your_test_executable.exe
```

### 3.2 Expected Output

A successful run will display each test case and status, for example:

```
[ RUN      ] SampleTest.SampleCase
[       OK ] SampleTest.SampleCase (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] AnotherTest.Case
[       OK ] AnotherTest.Case (1 ms)
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
```

### 3.3 Understanding Results

- `[ RUN      ]` indicates the start of a test.
- `[       OK ]` indicates the test passed.
- `[  FAILED  ]` indicates a test failure.
- `[  PASSED  ]` summary of successful tests.

If all tests pass, integration is validated.

### Troubleshooting Common Execution Issues

- **Tests do not run or executable fails:** Verify your executable is correctly built and runnable.
- **Tests fail unexpectedly:** Inspect failure messages to understand if issues are in test code or setup.

---

## 4. Interpreting Test Output and Validation

Understanding the test output is essential for confirming your tests run as expected.

### 4.1 Expected vs Unexpected Calls

When using GoogleMock, expected calls defined by `EXPECT_CALL` are automatically checked. Unexpected calls or calls without expectations generate error messages or warnings.

### 4.2 Common Output Messages

- **Expected Call:** Indicates a successful matching of a call to a mock method.

- **Unexpected Call:** Highlights when a mock method is called with arguments not covered by any expectation.

- **Excessive Call:** Shows when a method is called more times than expected.

- **Uninteresting Call:** (Warning) Indicates a mock method without any explicit expectation is called.

For details on these and examples, see the [GoogleMock Output Test](/googlemock/test/gmock_output_test_.cc).

### 4.3 Exit Codes and Test Status

- The test program returns zero for success.
- Non-zero exit codes indicate test failures or setup problems.

---

## 5. Quick Confirmation of GoogleMock Integration

To validate GoogleMock is integrated and functioning, write a minimal test using mock methods. Hereâ€™s an example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetValue, (), ());
};

TEST(SimpleMockTest, ReturnsExpectedValue) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
      .WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  EXPECT_EQ(mock.GetValue(), 42);
}
```

Compile and run this test. Successful output confirms your integration.

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Set expectations before exercising mocks:** Always define expectations before invoking methods on mocks.
- **Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors** when you don't want to enforce call counts.
- **Interpret warnings carefully:** Uninteresting calls may be harmless but indicate missing expectations.
- **Use verbose logging:** Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock call traces.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Does Not Run
- Check that test executable is correctly built.
- Confirm your `main()` calls `testing::InitGoogleMock()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Test Failures Related to Mock Expectations
- Verify `EXPECT_CALL` matchers and argument expectations.
- Ensure calls occur in the expected order if using sequences.

### Excessive or Unexpected Calls
- Confirm the number of calls matches `.Times()` specifications.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations once exhausted.

### Leaked Mocks Warning
- Make sure mock objects are properly deleted.
- Use `testing::Mock::AllowLeak(mock_object)` if intentional.

### Enable Verbose Output
Run tests with

```bash
./your_test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

This shows all mock calls and expectation matches, aiding debugging.

## 8. Next Steps

After successfully running and validating your tests, consider:

- Exploring writing your first test in the [Write Your First Test](../first_test_and_validation/create_first_test) guide.
- Reading the [gMock for Dummies](../gmock_for_dummies.md) for in-depth mocking basics.
- Reviewing the [gMock Cookbook](../gmock_cook_book.md) for advanced usage scenarios.
- Handling and troubleshooting common issues via [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](../first_test_and_validation/troubleshooting_setup).

For further details on mock object creation and behavior specifications, consult the [Mocking Reference](../../api-reference/mocking-actions-matchers/mock-objects-and-methods).
