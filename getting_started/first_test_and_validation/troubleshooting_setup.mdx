# Troubleshooting Setup Issues

This guide focuses on common problems encountered during the installation and initial usage of GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It provides clear, practical strategies to help you quickly identify, resolve, and move past typical setup hurdles such as compiler errors, missing dependencies, and build misconfigurations.

---

## 1. Common Compiler and Build Errors

Many setup issues stem from improper build configuration or environment mismatches. Below are frequent compilation errors and their resolutions.

### Error: Unsupported C++ Standard or Compiler Version

GoogleTest requires **C++17 support** and compatible compilers:

- GCC 7 or newer
- Clang 5 or newer
- MSVC 2017 or newer

**Fix:**
- Verify your compiler version with `gcc --version`, `clang --version`, or check MSVC version in your IDE.
- Ensure your build system passes the flag `-std=c++17` or equivalent.
- Upgrade your compiler if unsupported.

### Error: Missing or Incorrect Include Paths

If errors about missing GoogleTest or GoogleMock headers occur:

- Confirm that the include directories for the GoogleTest source or installed package are correctly specified in your build system (CMake, Bazel, makefiles).
- When integrating with Bazel, ensure `http_archive` or workspace rules include googletest correctly.

### Error: Linker Failures (Undefined References)

Symptoms include unresolved symbols for GoogleTest or GoogleMock functions.

**Fix:**
- Link against the GoogleTest libraries correctly.
- For CMake integration, link `gtest`, `gtest_main`, and `gmock` if using GoogleMock.
- For Bazel, specify `deps` properly in your BUILD files.

### Error: Macro or Naming Conflicts

When you encounter macro redefinition errors or unexpected behavior, especially on Windows:

- Ensure no conflicting macros from Windows headers define common function names (see [gMock FAQ](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_faq.html#mocked-method_named_like_a_macro)).
- Include platform-specific headers with suitable macro guards.

## 2. Configuration and Build Misconfigurations

### Switching Default Mock Behavior: Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

By default, GoogleMock mocks behave as **naggy mocks**, issuing warnings on uninteresting calls. This can be noisy during setup and testing. To suppress warnings or treat uninteresting calls as failures:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockClass> nice_mock;   // Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls
StrictMock<MockClass> strict_mock; // Treats uninteresting calls as errors
```

Common pitfall: `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` only apply to mock methods created directly with `MOCK_METHOD` in the mock class, not inherited mock methods. Also, the mock class should have a virtual destructor for proper behavior.

---

## 3. Dealing with Uninteresting vs Unexpected Calls

Understanding these distinctions will help in diagnosing test failures:

- **Uninteresting Call:** A call to a mock method that has no `EXPECT_CALL` set. By default, this triggers a warning but does not fail the test.
- **Unexpected Call:** A call to a mock method with `EXPECT_CALL`s set, but the call does not match any.

Use [`EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(0);`](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking.html#EXPECT_CALL.Times) to explicitly disallow calls.

**Tip:** If the "Uninteresting mock function call" warning is overwhelming, prefer wrapping your mocks in `NiceMock` or specify catch-all expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.

---

## 4. Running Tests with More Diagnostic Information

Sometimes issues arise from unexpected interactions. You can increase the verbosity of GoogleMock to gain deeper insight:

- Run tests with the flag: `--gmock_verbose=info`
  - Prints detailed info on every mock call, matching expectations, and call stack traces.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=warning` for less noisy output (default).
- Use `--gmock_verbose=error` to restrict output to only real errors.

Example:

```bash
./my_tests --gmock_verbose=info
```

This can help identify exactly which expectations failed, mismatch argument values, or misordered calls.

---

## 5. Tips for Debugging Setup

- **Check Virtual Destructors:** If you have mysterious heap failures or missing calls, ensure your interfaces and mocks have virtual destructors. This guards against improper object lifetimes.

- **Verify Build Flags:** Confirm that your build system defines all necessary compile options:
  - Use of `-pthread` or equivalent for threading support.
  - C++17 standard enabled.

- **Isolate Test Cases:** Run failing tests individually with high verbosity to pinpoint issues.

- **Examine Include Ordering:** Order system and third-party includes carefully to avoid macro clashes.

- **Use `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` When Needed:** To force verification of mocks before destruction if objects persist beyond test scope.

- **Leak Management:** Use `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_ptr)` if intentional leaks are causing confusing errors.

## 6. Example: Catching an Unexpected Call During Setup

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;
using ::testing::_;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (int n), ());
};

TEST(MockSetupTest, UnexpectedCallFails) {
  StrictMock<MockFoo> mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(5));

  // This will cause a failure as 10 was not expected.
  mock.Bar(10);
}
```

*Expected outcome:*  The test will fail immediately at `mock.Bar(10)`, signaling an unexpected call.
