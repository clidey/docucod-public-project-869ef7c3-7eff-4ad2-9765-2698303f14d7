# Community & Further Help

Welcome to the GoogleTest community and further help guide. This page connects you to valuable resources designed to support your journey with GoogleTest, whether you are troubleshooting persistent issues, looking for advanced tips, or seeking deeper knowledge from the community and official channels.

## Official Documentation

GoogleTest maintains a comprehensive set of official guides and references to walk you through everything from setup to advanced testing patterns.

- **Primary Documentation Site:** Explore the main GoogleTest documentation [here](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/main/docs).
- **Core Guides:** Find detailed explanations on writing tests, assertion mechanisms, mocking with GoogleMock, and test runner usage.
- **Advanced Topics:** For deeper insights, check the advanced guides including test fixtures, parameterized tests, and death tests.

If you want to dive into specific aspects, consider the following linked guides elsewhere in the documentation:

- [Writing Your First Test](../../getting_started/first_test_run_validation/write_first_test) – start testing in C++ effortlessly.
- [Mocking Workflows with GoogleMock](../../guides/advanced-testing-patterns/mocking-workflows) – understand mocking fundamentals and best practices.
- [Common Installation & Setup Problems](../../getting_started/troubleshooting/common_problems) – troubleshoot common challenges.


## Community Resources

Sometimes, community knowledge and shared experiences provide an invaluable supplement to official guides.

- **Community-Created Documentation:** Various community members publish tutorials, deep dives, and practical tips. For example, the [Googlemock Insights](https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/googletest/insights.md) by ElectricRCAircraftGuy contains rich practical notes.

- **Discussion Forums:** Engage with the community at [Google Test Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/googletestframework) or on popular developer forums such as Stack Overflow.

- **GitHub Issues:** Report bugs, request features, or explore existing issues on the [GoogleTest GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues).


## Issue Tracker & Support

Have you encountered a persistent problem? Follow these steps for effective resolution:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before opening a new ticket, check the GitHub Issues page to see if your problem has been reported or addressed.
2. **Provide Detailed Information:** When filing a bug or feature request, include minimal reproducible code, platform details, compiler versions, and error logs.
3. **Use Labels and Templates:** Follow the issue templates provided on the GitHub repository to help maintainers triage quickly.


## Best Practices for Getting Help

- **Reproduce Locally:** Isolate your problem in a small test case.
- **Consult the Docs:** Cross-reference your issue with the official documentation.
- **Engage the Community:** Ask questions with clear context and code examples.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep your GoogleTest and GoogleMock versions current to benefit from the latest fixes and features.
