# Internal Utilities and Portability Macros

This reference page exposes GoogleMock's critical internal utility APIs that enable advanced users to extend, troubleshoot, or customize mock behavior reliably. These include internal helpers for matcher implementation, portability macros to support diverse platforms and compilers, and low-level adaptation hooks. Accessing these APIs requires careful attention to recommended usage patterns, given their delicate nature and potential for breaking changes.

---

## Overview

GoogleMock is a powerful and extensible C++ mocking framework built on top of GoogleTest. At its core, it provides user-facing utilities like matcher macros and mock method definitions. However, underneath, a set of *internal utilities* and *portability macros* exist that simplify the complexity of implementing flexible and efficient matchers, accommodate different platform behaviors, and handle compiler quirks.

This page documents these internal components relevant to advanced users who need fine-grained control or wish to author custom matchers and behaviors that integrate seamlessly with the core framework.

## Internal APIs for Custom Matcher Implementation

These utilities enable writing polymorphic, parameterizable, and expressive custom matchers, which interact properly with GoogleMock's matching engine and reporting system.

### Matcher Interface and Helper Types

- **`Matcher<T>`**: Core polymorphic matcher type that encapsulates matcher logic.
- **`MatcherInterface<T>`**: Abstract interface for matcher implementation.
- **`SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)`**: Safely casts a matcher `m` to a matcher of type `T`, enforcing type compatibility.
- **`MatcherCast<T>(m)`**: Explicitly converts between matcher types, handling polymorphic and monomorphic cases.
- **`MakeMatcher()` / `MakePolymorphicMatcher()`**: Factory functions for constructing matcher wrappers.

### Base Classes for Matcher Implementation

- **`MatcherBaseImpl<Derived>`**: Simplifies creation of polymorphic matchers via a CRTP pattern.
- **`VariadicMatcher<CombiningMatcher, Args...>`**: Facilitates building matchers that combine multiple inner matchers (e.g., `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`).

### Matching and Explanation Utilities

- **`MatchPrintAndExplain(value, matcher, listener)`**: Matches a value against a matcher while printing detailed match outcomes and explanations.
- **`StringMatchResultListener`**: Captures explanation strings reported during matching (used to provide richer failure messages).

### Parameterized Matchers & MATCHER Macros

- Implements the **`MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, ..., `MATCHER_P10`** macros that simplify defining matchers with up to 10 parameters.
- These macros generate classes inheriting from the matcher base, auto-handle parameter capture, description generation (including negation), and provide a `MatchAndExplain()` method for custom matching logic.

### Common Polymorphic Matchers Provided

GoogleMock exposes a wide variety of internal polymorphic matchers implemented with these utilities, including but not limited to:

- **`_`** (Anything matcher): Matches any value.
- **`A<T>()` / `An<T>()`**: Matches any value of type T.
- **`IsNull()` / `NotNull()`**: Match null and non-null pointers.
- **`Ref(variable)`**: Matches references to a specific variable.
- **String Matchers:** `StrEq()`, `StrCaseEq()`, `HasSubstr()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()`, case-insensitive variants included.
- **Floating Point Matchers:** `FloatEq()`, `DoubleEq()`, Near-matchers with tolerance and NaN awareness.
- **Container Matchers:** `Contains()`, `Each()`, `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `SizeIs()`, `WhenSorted()`, and many more facilitating fine-grained container validation.

### Advanced Matchers and Helpers

- **`Not()`**: Negates inner matcher logic.
- **`AllOf()` / `AnyOf()`**: Combines multiple matchers with logical AND or OR.
- **`Conditional()`**: Selects matcher based on boolean condition.
- **`ResultOf()`**: Matches the value mapped by a callable.
- **`Field()` / `Property()`**: Matches a specific class field or property.
- **`Key()` / `Pair()`**: Helpers for matching pair-like types (e.g., map entries).
- **`Optional()`**: Matches values inside optional types.
- **`VariantWith()`** and **`AnyWith()`**: Match contained types in `std::variant` and `absl::any` respectively.

### Notes

- The internal namespace contains implementation details; users should rely primarily on macros and polymorphic matcher factory functions.
- Matchers produce descriptive failure messages, with the ability for custom explanatory streaming.
- Use provided helpers for type safety and compatibility when writing custom matchers.

## Portability Macros and Platform Adaptation

GoogleMock supports compilation and operation across numerous platforms, compilers, and environments. This requires careful abstraction of platform specifics and compatibility handling.

### Compiler & Platform Feature Detection

- Macros and constants determine compiler capabilities and platform features, e.g., support for:
  - Exception handling
  - RTTI (Run-Time Type Information)
  - Wide strings (`std::wstring`)
  - File system availability
  - Threading (`pthreads`, Windows threads)
  - Stream redirection

### Compiler-Specific Pragmas and Warnings

- Macros control warning suppression, especially to silence noisy warnings on MSVC and Clang.
- Macros like `GMOCK_INTERNAL_WARNING_PUSH()`, `GMOCK_INTERNAL_WARNING_CLANG()` and `GMOCK_INTERNAL_WARNING_POP()` wrap compiler-specific pragma directives.

### Feature-Conditional Macros

- Macros like `GMOCK_DEFINE_bool_`, `GMOCK_DECLARE_int32_`, etc. abstract implementation differences for flag declaration and definition.
- GoogleMock integrates optionally with Abseil flags if available, or falls back to standard globals.
- Macros ensure flag reference consistency, getter/setter access, and platform-safe flag handling.

### Thread Safety & Synchronization

- GoogleMock inherits thread-related utilities from GoogleTest, e.g., mutex and thread-local storage abstractions.
- Users receive safe concurrent execution support when using GoogleMock in multithreaded contexts.

### Portability Advice

- Users extending the framework should not redefine these macros; instead use the documented flag APIs and matcher factories.
- Internal macros and utilities ensure consistent behavior across supported platforms and should be preserved.

## Safe Usage and Extension Guidance

While these internal utilities offer powerful extensibility pathways, exercise caution:

- **Do not call internal APIs directly unless necessary.** Prefer public factory functions and macros when implementing matchers.
- **Always ensure type correctness and compatibility**, leveraging `SafeMatcherCast` and related helpers.
- **Write clear matcher descriptions** to facilitate debugging; use provided streaming facilities for failure explanations.
- **Handle null and corner cases gracefully** in matchers, especially with pointers and optional types.
- **Keep platform constraints in mind** when writing code that interacts with underlying OS or compiler specifics.

## Example: Defining a Custom Parameterized Matcher

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// Define a custom matcher to check if a number is even with a custom description
MATCHER(IsEven, "") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

// Usage in a test:
TEST(MyTestSuite, CheckEvenNumber) {
  EXPECT_THAT(4, IsEven());  // Passes
  EXPECT_THAT(5, IsEven());  // Fails with "Expected: is even"
}

// Parameterized matcher example
MATCHER_P(HasAbsoluteValue, value, "") {
  return abs(arg) == value;
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, CheckAbsoluteValue) {
  EXPECT_THAT(-3, HasAbsoluteValue(3));  // Passes
  EXPECT_THAT(2, HasAbsoluteValue(3));   // Fails
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Build issues**: verify platform macros and compiler support flags are correctly set.
- **Matcher link errors**: ensure custom matchers are defined at namespace scope using supported macros.
- **Unexpected type cast errors**: review use of `SafeMatcherCast` to ensure safe conversions.
- **Verbose logging support**: configure and use `--gmock_verbose` flag properly (see related InitGoogleMock documentation).
- **Runtime failures**: Utilize matchers' result listeners to diagnose match mismatches.
