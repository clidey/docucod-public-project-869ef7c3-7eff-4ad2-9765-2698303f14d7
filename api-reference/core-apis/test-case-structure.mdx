# Test Case Structure

Understanding the structure of a GoogleTest test file is crucial to writing clear, maintainable tests and organizing them for efficient discovery and execution. This reference page breaks down the fundamental components of a test case in GoogleTest, covering how tests are defined, registered, initialized, and the lifecycle hooks available. Whether you're writing simple tests or complex fixtures, knowing the anatomy of test cases empowers you to craft robust tests with clarity and precision.

## Defining Tests: TEST, TEST_F, and TEST_P Macros

GoogleTest provides several macros to define individual tests, each tailored to particular testing scenarios:

### 1. `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`
Defines a basic test without any shared fixture state. This macro declares a test named `TestName` under the test suite `TestSuiteName`.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

- Both arguments must be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.
- Used for standalone tests.
- Does not support shared setup or teardown.

### 2. `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`
Defines a test that uses a test fixture class `TestFixtureName`, enabling reuse of data and setup logic.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  Queue<int> q1_;
  void SetUp() override {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 1);
}
```

- `TestFixtureName` is a class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Fixtures isolate tests for independence and reusability.
- Constructor and destructor can be used for per-test initialization/cleanup, but `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` are preferred.

### 3. `TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`
Defines a value-parameterized test that runs multiple times with different parameters supplied.

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    PositiveValues, FooTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

- Requires defining a fixture deriving from `TestWithParam<T>`.
- Enables data-driven testing patterns.
- Paired with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to specify parameter set.

---

## Test Registration and Discovery

GoogleTest automatically registers all tests declared with the above macros before execution begins. This dynamic registration facilitates:

- Running all tests with a simple `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` invocation.
- Filtering tests by name or suite using command-line flags like `--gtest_filter`.
- Avoiding manual enumeration of tests.

For runtime or programmatic test creation, `testing::RegisterTest()` allows dynamic registration:

```cpp
testing::RegisterTest(
    "DynamicSuite", "DynamicTest", nullptr, nullptr,
    __FILE__, __LINE__, []() -> testing::Test* { return new MyTestFixture(); });
```

This method must be called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

---

## Test Initialization and Lifecycle Hooks

GoogleTest supports hooks to manage setup and teardown at different scopes:

### Per-Test Lifecycle
- **Constructor and Destructor**: Called for each test instance, set up and clean up resources.
- **`SetUp()`**: Override this method to prepare test environment; called immediately after the constructor.
- **`TearDown()`**: Override this method to clean up after each test; called before the destructor.

Each test is executed with a fresh fixture instance, ensuring tests are independent.

### Per-Test-Suite Lifecycle
Define static methods in your fixture class that control shared resources used by multiple tests.

- **`SetUpTestSuite()`**: Invoked once before any tests in the suite run.
- **`TearDownTestSuite()`**: Invoked once after all tests in the suite finish.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};
Resource* FooTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

Be mindful that `SetUpTestSuite()` can be called multiple times if your fixture has derived classes.

## Test Execution Flow

When you invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest:

1. Initializes all registered tests and environments.
2. Calls `SetUpTestSuite()` for each test suite.
3. For each test:
    - Constructs the fixture instance.
    - Calls `SetUp()`.
    - Runs the test body.
    - Calls `TearDown()`.
    - Destroys the fixture instance.
4. Calls `TearDownTestSuite()` for each test suite.
5. Reports results.

Failures inside `SetUp` or `TearDown` abort that particular test.

---

## Best Practices for Writing Test Cases

- **Use Fixtures** when multiple tests share setup code or need shared objects.
- **Keep Tests Independent** to ease debugging and parallel execution.
- **Name Tests Clearly**: Test suite and test names should be descriptive and follow C++ identifier rules (no underscores).
- **Use `EXPECT_` for Nonfatal Checks** to collect multiple failures per test; Use `ASSERT_` when continuing on failure doesn't make sense.
- **Leverage Parameterized Tests** for coverage of input spaces without duplicating code.
- **Avoid Side Effects in Tests**: Tests should not depend on order of execution or shared mutable state unless explicitly managed.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. SetUp Not Called
- Ensure you override `SetUp()` with exact capitalization.
- Use `override` keyword to catch misspellings at compile time.

### 2. Tests Not Running
- Verify tests are registered properly.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to confirm registration.

### 3. Underscore in Test Names
- Avoid underscores in `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` to prevent linker or naming conflicts.

### 4. Test Fixture Lacking Default Constructor
- GoogleTest requires default-constructible test fixtures. Provide one explicitly if needed.

## Summary

Understanding the test case structure in GoogleTest enables you to write maintainable, discoverable, and efficient tests. By defining tests using `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P`, managing setup and teardown with lifecycle hooks, and registering tests automatically, you can create robust test suites that fit your project needs and execution workflows.
