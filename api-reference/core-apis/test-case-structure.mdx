# Test Case Structure & Lifecycle

This reference guide helps you master how to structure test cases and test suites in GoogleTest, manage fixture setup and teardown, utilize lifecycle hooks, and organize execution through main entry points. You'll gain a clear understanding of the test execution flow, how to share resources efficiently, employ advanced test types like parameterized and typed tests, and invoke tests programmatically or via the standard test runner.

---

## 1. Introduction to Test Cases, Test Suites, and Lifecycle

GoogleTest organizes testing code into **test cases** (historically called *test suites*) that group logically related tests. Each **test** is an individual scenario to verify behavior, while a **test suite** provides a shared context via test fixtures.

Tests are executed independently. GoogleTest creates a fresh test fixture object for each test, runs setup, test code, teardown, and then destroys the fixture to isolate tests and avoid side effects spilling over.

### Key Concepts
- **Test Suite (Test Case):** Groups related tests that may share resources.
- **Test Fixture:** C++ class deriving from `testing::Test` supplying setup and teardown.
- **Test:** An individual assertion scenario within a test suite.

---

## 2. Writing Tests: Test Macros and Usage

### 2.1 `TEST`
Defines an independent test without a fixture.

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  // Test code...
  EXPECT_EQ(3, my_func());
}
```
- No fixture; for simple or stateless tests.

### 2.2 `TEST_F`
Defines a test that uses a test fixture class.

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize shared objects
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean-up after each test
  }

  MyExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, DoesSomething) {
  ASSERT_NE(shared_resource_, nullptr);
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_resource_->IsReady());
}
```
- Fixture instance is created fresh and destroyed per test.
- SetUp() and TearDown() hooks run before/after each test.

### 2.3 `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`
Value-parameterized tests allow running the same test logic with various input values.

```cpp
class ParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(ParamTest, IsEven) {
  int value = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(value % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenValues, ParamTest, testing::Values(2,4,6,8));
```
- `TEST_P` defines the test using a fixture implementing `WithParamInterface<T>`.
- `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` registers the parameter sets.

### 2.4 Typed Tests `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`
Typed tests repeat test logic over a list of types.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class TypedFixture : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, double, std::string>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(TypedFixture, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(TypedFixture, CanDefaultConstruct) {
  TypeParam v;
  SUCCEED();  // Just checking this compiles and runs
}
```

---

## 3. Fixture Lifecycle: Setup and Teardown

GoogleTest supports multiple lifecycle stages allowing resource management at test, test suite, and global levels.

### 3.1 Per-Test Lifecycle Hooks
- `SetUp()` - Called immediately before each test.
- `TearDown()` - Called immediately after each test.

Example:

```cpp
void SetUp() override {
  // Prepare environment for this test
}

void TearDown() override {
  // Clean-up after test
}
```

### 3.2 Per-Test-Suite (Fixture Class) Lifecycle Hooks
- `static void SetUpTestSuite()` - Called once before the **first** test of the suite.
- `static void TearDownTestSuite()` - Called once after the **last** test of the suite.

Use these to initialize and destroy expensive shared resources.

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

 protected:
  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* MyFixture::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

### 3.3 Global Test Environment
Use the `Environment` class and `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` to set up and tear down resources shared across **all** test suites.

```cpp
class MyEnvironment : public testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare global state
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean-up global state
  }
};

testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnvironment);
```

---

## 4. Test Execution Flow and Main Entry Point

The typical test program uses GoogleTest's built-in `main()` or a custom main that:

1. Initializes GoogleTest flags via:

```cpp
testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
```
2. Calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to execute all registered tests:

```cpp
return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
```

### Typical Custom Main Example

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  // Optional: add global test environments
  testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MySetupEnvironment);

  // Run all the tests
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### What Happens When `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` Executes?

- Global Environments `SetUp()` run once before tests.
- For each test suite:
  - `SetUpTestSuite()` is called before the first test.
  - For each test in the suite:
    - A fresh fixture instance is created.
    - `SetUp()` is called.
    - Test body runs.
    - `TearDown()` is called.
    - Fixture instance is destroyed.
  - `TearDownTestSuite()` is called after the last test.
- Global Environments `TearDown()` run once after tests.

---

## 5. Advanced Test Registration and Invocation

### 5.1 Programmatic Test Registration

When standard macros don't suffice (for example, dynamic or parameter-driven test cases), tests can be registered at runtime using `RegisterTest`:

```cpp
TestInfo* RegisterTest(
  const char* test_suite_name, const char* test_name,
  const char* type_param, const char* value_param,
  const char* file, int line, std::function<Fixture*()> factory);
```

This registers a test with a factory that creates instances of the test fixture.

### 5.2 Skipping Tests at Runtime

You can skip tests conditionally using the `GTEST_SKIP()` macro, optionally with a message:

```cpp
TEST(MyTest, SkipExample) {
  if (!IsEnvironmentReady()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "Environment not ready";
  }
  // test body
}
```

Similarly, skipping all tests in a fixture can be done in `SetUp()`.

### 5.3 Running Subsets of Tests

Use filters via command-line flags such as `--gtest_filter` to run specific tests or suites, enabling targeted verification and debugging.

### 5.4 Test Naming Conventions

Avoid underscores `_` in test suite and test names due to internal macro and class name generation ambiguities. Use camel case or Pascal case.

## 6. Example: Full Fixture and Test Suite Lifecycle

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class ResourceIntensiveFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static ExpensiveObject* resource_;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    resource_ = new ExpensiveObject();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete resource_;
    resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare for each test
    resource_->Reset();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean-up after each test
    resource_->Cleanup();
  }
};

ExpensiveObject* ResourceIntensiveFixture::resource_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(ResourceIntensiveFixture, TestOne) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(resource_->DoSomething());
}

TEST_F(ResourceIntensiveFixture, TestTwo) {
  EXPECT_EQ(resource_->GetValue(), 42);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Lifecycle Issues

### 7.1 SetUp() or TearDown() Not Called
- Ensure correct capitalization: use capital `U` in `SetUp()` and capital `T` in `TearDown()`.

### 7.2 Mixing Fixtures in Same Test Suite
- GoogleTest requires all tests within a suite to share the **same** fixture type.
- Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` within the same suite is illegal and will cause runtime errors.

### 7.3 Fatal Assertions in Constructors or Destructors
- Fatal assertions like `ASSERT_*` cannot be used in constructors or destructors (compile-time error).
- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for fatal assertion support.

### 7.4 Shared Resources Not Cleaned Up
- Always delete or reset shared static resources in `TearDownTestSuite()`.
- `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` may be called multiple times with inheritance; manage carefully.

### 7.5 Test Order Dependency
- Tests run in unspecified order; do not write tests that depend on others' side effects.

## 9. Related Utilities

- `SCOPED_TRACE(message)`: Add diagnostic trace messages scoped within a function to help trace assertion failures in called subroutines.
- `HasFatalFailure()`: Static method in `testing::Test` to check if the current test already has a fatal failure.
- `RecordProperty(key, value)`: Add metadata key-value pairs to the current test or test suite.

---

## 10. Summary

Proper structuring of tests with GoogleTest involves understanding test suites, fixtures, lifecycle hooks (`SetUp`, `TearDown`, `SetUpTestSuite`, `TearDownTestSuite`), and the main entry flow. This allows efficient test resource management, clean isolation, and flexible parameterization.

Best practices include avoiding misuse of fixtures in test suites, correctly using lifecycle methods for resource management, and following naming rules to prevent clashes.

Use the GoogleTest-provided macros and APIs for advanced setups such as programmatic registration, skipping tests, and accessing test metadata for richer test reporting.
