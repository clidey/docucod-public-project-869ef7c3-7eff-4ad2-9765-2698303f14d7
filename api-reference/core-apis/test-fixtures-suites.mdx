# Test Fixtures & Suites

Guide to defining and customizing test fixtures and suites using GoogleTest, including lifecycle management, parameterized tests, and reusable test code organization.

---

## Introduction

GoogleTest's `Test Fixtures` and `Test Suites` are powerful constructs that enable you to organize, reuse, and customize your test code efficiently. This page explains how to define test fixtures, manage their lifecycle, create parameterized tests, and structure suites for scalable and maintainable tests.

Utilizing test fixtures and suites correctly empowers you to write cleaner tests that share setup/teardown logic, handle multiple test variations, and avoid redundant code. Whether you’re building simple unit tests or complex, data-driven test scenarios, understanding these elements is vital for maximizing your productivity with GoogleTest.

## Test Fixtures: Definition and Lifecycle

### What is a Test Fixture?

A **test fixture** is a class derived from `::testing::Test` that encapsulates common setup and teardown logic shared among multiple related tests. It helps you:

- Group tests logically by context.
- Avoid repetitive setup code.
- Maintain state or resources across multiple test methods.

### Defining a Test Fixture

To create a test fixture:

1. Derive a class from `::testing::Test`.
2. Override the virtual methods `SetUp()` and/or `TearDown()` to initialize and clean up resources.
3. Write tests using the `TEST_F` macro, associating each test with the fixture.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MyFeatureTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare shared test resources
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up after each test
  }

  // Shared data members for tests
  int shared_value = 0;
};

// A test within the fixture
TEST_F(MyFeatureTest, DoesSomething) {
  shared_value = 5;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_value, 5);
}

// Another test in the same fixture
TEST_F(MyFeatureTest, DoesSomethingElse) {
  EXPECT_NE(shared_value, 10);
}
```

### Lifecycle

- `SetUp()` runs before each test in the fixture.
- `TearDown()` runs after each test completes.

This guarantees a fresh environment per test method, preventing unintended side effects.

### Best Practices

- Keep setup minimal to speed up tests.
- Use fixture members to share data or mocks.
- Prefer `TEST_F` over `TEST` for tests that require setup.

---

## Test Suites

A **test suite** is a collection of tests logically grouped, usually by related functionality or feature. In GoogleTest:

- Tests sharing the same fixture class belong to the same test suite.
- Test suites help organize test output and control what is run via filters.

### Naming and Organization

- Use descriptive names for test suites to communicate intent clearly.
- Group related test fixtures under suites to maintain clarity.

---

## Parameterized Tests

Parameterized tests let you run the same test logic over multiple input values or types without duplicating code.

### Creating Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest offers two main ways:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Tests run multiple times with different parameter values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Tests run with different types.

### Value-Parameterized Tests Example

1. Define a fixture template derived from `::testing::TestWithParam<T>`.
2. Instantiate tests with parameter values using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Fixture with parameter
class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

// Parameterized test
TEST_P(FactorialTest, ComputesCorrectly) {
  int n = GetParam();
  // Suppose Factorial(n) computes factorial
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(n), ExpectedFactorial(n));
}

// Values to test
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    CommonFactorials,
    FactorialTest,
    ::testing::Values(0, 1, 2, 3, 8));
```

### Type-Parameterized Tests Example

1. Define a fixture template derived from `::testing::Test`.
2. Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` to specify types.
3. Use `TYPED_TEST` for test definitions.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class StackTest : public ::testing::Test {
  // Fixture code here
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(StackTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(StackTest, PushPop) {
  TypeParam value = static_cast<TypeParam>(42);
  // Test logic
  EXPECT_TRUE(PushPopWorks(value));
}
```

### Advanced Parameterization

- Use **`TestWithParam<std::tuple<...>>`** for multiple parameters.
- Combine with **custom parameter generators** for complex test data.

### Benefits

- Test broad input spaces with minimal code.
- Easier maintenance: update test logic in one place.
- Improved test coverage and confidence.

---

## Organizing Reusable Test Code

### Common Setup and Utilities

- Encapsulate shared helpers, mocks, and test data in test fixture classes.
- Use **base test fixtures** for common utilities, extended by specialized fixtures.

### Grouping Tests

- Use GoogleTest’s grouping via test suites and parameterization to keep tests logical.
- Maintain clear, consistent naming conventions for discoverability.

### Suite and Fixture Hierarchy Suggestions

- Small focused fixtures for simple components.
- Hierarchical fixtures for layered functionalities.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Minimize fixture state:** Only store what tests truly share.
- **Avoid heavy setup:** Prefer initialization via constructor or one-time setup if necessary.
- **Clean up resources carefully** using `TearDown()`.
- **Use parameterized tests to avoid duplication** and validate across values.
- **Leverage `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`** (static methods) for expensive setup once per suite.
- **Name your tests clearly** to reflect their purpose and parameters.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-using test fixtures can make tests harder to read.
- Mixing too much state in a fixture leads to fragile tests.
- Forgetting to call `TearDown()` or releasing resources causes leaks.
- Failure to use parameterized tests may cause duplication and less coverage.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If tests share state unexpectedly, check for static/global variables or fixture misuse.
- If tests are flaky, verify proper cleanup in `TearDown()`.
- If parameterized tests fail unpredictably, confirm parameters are set and accessed correctly.
