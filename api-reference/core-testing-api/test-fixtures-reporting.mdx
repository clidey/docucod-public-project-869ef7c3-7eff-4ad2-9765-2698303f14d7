# Test Fixtures, Environment, and Reporting

GoogleTest offers a powerful suite of tools to manage your tests' lifecycle, configure global test environments, and gather detailed test execution data. This documentation focuses on leveraging test fixtures for setup/teardown operations, managing test environments globally, and using advanced reporting features through event listeners and diagnostic interfaces.

---

## 1. Test Fixtures: Setup and Teardown Patterns

Test fixtures provide a reusable context for multiple tests that share the same resources or state. They enable consistent setup before each test and clean-up afterwards. GoogleTest's fundamental fixture class is **`testing::Test`**, and your fixtures derive from it.

### Basic Fixture Usage

- Derive a test fixture class from `testing::Test`.
- Implement `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for per-test initialization and cleanup.
- Use `TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName)` macros to write tests that use the fixture.

**Example:**

```cpp
class ResourceFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Common setup code
    resource_ = new Resource;
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup code
    delete resource_;
  }

  Resource* resource_;
};

TEST_F(ResourceFixture, TestOne) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(resource_->IsReady());
}

TEST_F(ResourceFixture, TestTwo) {
  ASSERT_NE(resource_, nullptr);
  // Test using resource_
}
```

### Per-Test-Suite Setup and Teardown

Sometimes setup/teardown needs to happen only once per test suite (all tests sharing the fixture) rather than per test.

- Implement `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` in your fixture class.
- GoogleTest calls `SetUpTestSuite()` once before the first test in the suite.
- It calls `TearDownTestSuite()` once after the last test in the suite.

**Example:**

```cpp
class ExpensiveFixture : public testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_data_ = LoadLargeDataSet();
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_data_;
    shared_data_ = nullptr;
  }

 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Per-test code
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Per-test clean-up
  }

  static DataSet* shared_data_;
};

DataSet* ExpensiveFixture::shared_data_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(ExpensiveFixture, UsesSharedData) {
  ASSERT_NE(shared_data_, nullptr);
  // Use shared_data_ in the test
}
```

### Nonfatal Failures in Fixtures

GoogleTest supports *nonfatal* failures inside fixture constructors, `SetUp()`, and `TearDown()`. However, fatal failures in constructors abort the test immediately.

Use `ADD_FAILURE()` to add non-fatal failures in constructors and `SetUp()`, allowing the test to proceed.

<Tip>
Avoid using fatal assertions inside constructors or destructors, as they do not abort the whole test but can leave the fixture in an invalid state. Instead, prefer `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for assertions requiring test aborts.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Managing Global Test Environments

Global test environments enable shared setup/teardown across all tests in a test program.

### Defining a Test Environment

- Derive a class from `testing::Environment`.
- Override virtual methods `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyGlobalEnvironment : public testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code to set up environment (e.g., start servers, initialize DB)
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Code to clean up environment
  }
};
```

### Registering Global Environments

Call `testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` before running tests to register environments.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyGlobalEnvironment);

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Execution Flow

When invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest:

- Calls `SetUp()` on all global environments in registration order.
- Runs tests only if no fatal failures or global skips occur.
- Calls `TearDown()` on all global environments in reverse registration order even if tests are skipped or fail.

<Tip>
Use global environments to manage expensive or shared resources across test suites, such as database connection pools or external services.
</Tip>

## 3. Advanced Test Reporting

GoogleTest provides a flexible event listener API and diagnostic interfaces to customize and extend test reporting. These are particularly useful for integrating with CI pipelines, custom test dashboards, or detailed diagnostics.

### Event Listener API

The `testing::TestEventListener` interface provides hooks corresponding to key points in the test lifecycle.

#### Key Callbacks Include:

| Event                          | Method                                 | Description                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Before any test starts         | `OnTestProgramStart(const UnitTest&)` | Before any test activity begins.             |
| Before each iteration starts   | `OnTestIterationStart(const UnitTest&, int)` | Before test iteration (if repeating).        |
| Before environment setup start | `OnEnvironmentsSetUpStart(const UnitTest&)` | Before global environment setup begins.      |
| After environment setup ends   | `OnEnvironmentsSetUpEnd(const UnitTest&)` | After global environment setup completes.    |
| Before a test suite starts     | `OnTestSuiteStart(const TestSuite&)` | Before running a test suite.                   |
| Before a test starts           | `OnTestStart(const TestInfo&)`        | Before running an individual test.            |
| After assertion result         | `OnTestPartResult(const TestPartResult&)` | After a test assertion or explicit SUCCEED()/FAIL() call. |
| After a test ends              | `OnTestEnd(const TestInfo&)`           | After an individual test finishes.            |
| After a test suite ends        | `OnTestSuiteEnd(const TestSuite&)`     | After all tests in a suite finish.             |
| Before environment teardown    | `OnEnvironmentsTearDownStart(const UnitTest&)` | Before tearing down global environment.       |
| After environment teardown     | `OnEnvironmentsTearDownEnd(const UnitTest&)` | After tearing down global environment.        |
| After test iteration ends      | `OnTestIterationEnd(const UnitTest&, int)` | After a test iteration completes.              |
| After all test activity ends   | `OnTestProgramEnd(const UnitTest&)`    | After all tests and environments finish.

### Using Event Listeners

- Subclass `TestEventListener` or `EmptyTestEventListener` (which provides empty default implementations).
- Override methods relevant to your custom logic.
- Add your listener to the GoogleTest event listener list via:

```cpp
main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::TestEventListeners& listeners =
      testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();

  // Optionally remove default printer
  delete listeners.Release(listeners.default_result_printer());

  // Add your listener
  listeners.Append(new MyCustomListener);

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Use Cases for Event Listeners:

- **Custom Output:** Replace the console or XML output format.
- **Logging:** Tag or capture test results for analytics.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Track resource usage or leaks during tests.
- **Diagnostics:** Implement memory leak checkers or performance logging.

### Restrictions and Tips

- Do **not** generate test failures within `OnTestPartResult()` to avoid recursion.
- Add listeners that handle `OnTestPartResult()` before listeners that generate failures to ensure failures are correctly attributed.

## 4. Diagnostic Interfaces and Test Context

GoogleTest exposes rich reflection interfaces to access information about tests, suites, and results programmatically.

### Key Classes:

| Class Name         | Description                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `UnitTest`         | Represents the entire test program.                       |
| `TestSuite`        | Represents a group of related tests.                      |
| `TestInfo`         | Provides detailed info about a single test.              |
| `TestResult`       | Holds the results and properties of a test run.          |
| `TestPartResult`   | Represents the outcome of individual assertions.         |
| `TestProperty`     | Captures key-value properties recorded during a test.    |

### Accessing Currently Running Test Information

You can retrieve the currently executing testâ€™s context during test runtime:

```cpp
const testing::TestInfo* test_info = testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->current_test_info();
if (test_info) {
  std::cout << "Currently running test: "
            << test_info->test_suite_name() << "." << test_info->name() << std::endl;
}
```

### Recording Properties for Tests

During test execution, you can log key/value properties relevant to your test:

```cpp
testing::Test::RecordProperty("Key", "Value");
```

- Properties recorded within a test are included as attributes in the XML report at the `<testcase>` level.
- Properties recorded during `SetUpTestSuite()` or `TearDownTestSuite()` are logged at the `<testsuite>` level.
- Properties recorded outside all suites appear at the top-level `<testsuites>` element.

<Tip>
Choose property keys that are valid XML attribute names and avoid naming collisions with predefined GoogleTest attributes such as `name`, `status`, `time`, etc.
</Tip>

## 5. Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- Ensure that global environments are added **before** calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Otherwise, their setup and teardown will not be triggered.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` **only** for global or expensive setup/teardown shared by the entire suite. Avoid modifying state that may cause test dependencies.
- Avoid fatal assertions in constructors; prefer `SetUp()` where failures can more safely abort the test.
- When adding event listeners, remove the default output listeners if you want clean output exclusively from your listeners.
- Understand the order of event callbacks; start events fire in forward order, end events in reverse order.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE(message)` or `testing::ScopedTrace` when working with helper functions to add context traces to failure messages.

## 6. Example: Custom Event Listener for Concise Output

```cpp
class SimpleListener : public testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const testing::TestInfo& info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting test: " << info.test_suite_name()
              << "." << info.name() << std::endl;
  }

  void OnTestPartResult(const testing::TestPartResult& result) override {
    if (result.failed()) {
      std::cout << "Failure in " << result.file_name() << ":" << result.line_number()
                << " - " << result.summary() << std::endl;
    }
  }

  void OnTestEnd(const testing::TestInfo& info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished test: " << info.test_suite_name()
              << "." << info.name()
              << (info.result()->Passed() ? " PASSED" : " FAILED") << std::endl;
  }
};

// Usage in main:
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  auto& listeners = testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
  delete listeners.Release(listeners.default_result_printer());
  listeners.Append(new SimpleListener);

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```
