# Test Macros and Fixtures

This page details the primary test definition macros and fixture mechanisms that GoogleTest offers to define, organize, and run tests effectively. It covers the usages of `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and the lifecycle callbacks `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`, supporting both simple and complex use cases for test structuring.

---

## 1. Overview of Test Definition Macros

GoogleTest provides you with macros to define tests that can be run independently or share common setup and teardown code.

### 1.1 `TEST` Macro: Simple, Independent Tests

- The `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro defines a single test function.
- Both arguments are identifiers without underscores.
- Each test defined by `TEST` is completely independent and runs in isolation.

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Factorial) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Here, `MathTest` is a test suite and `Factorial` is the test's name.

### 1.2 `TEST_F` Macro: Tests Using Fixtures

- Use `TEST_F(FixtureClassName, TestName)` when the tests need to share objects or setup code.
- The test fixture class must derive from `testing::Test`.
- The test fixture provides shared objects and setup/teardown methods.

Example fixture class:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    q_.Enqueue(1);
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up if needed
  }

  Queue<int> q_;
};
```

Test using the fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsNotEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q_.size(), 1);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, CanDequeue) {
  int* n = q_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each `TEST_F` test runs with a fresh instance of `QueueTest`.

## 2. Test Fixture Lifecycle

GoogleTest manages the test fixture object by:

- Creating a new fixture instance for each test.
- Calling the constructor.
- Calling the `SetUp()` method.
- Running the test body.
- Calling the `TearDown()` method.
- Deleting the fixture instance.

Use these lifecycle methods for test resource management.

### 2.1 Constructor and Destructor

- The constructor runs before each test.
- The destructor runs after each test.
- Often, the constructor and destructor can be omitted for trivial setup/cleanup.

### 2.2 `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` Methods

- Override `SetUp()` to prepare the environment or initialize objects for each test.
- Override `TearDown()` to release resources or perform cleanup after each test.

```cpp
void SetUp() override {
  // Initialize resources
}

void TearDown() override {
  // Cleanup resources
}
```

⚠️ Ensure your `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` do not throw exceptions unexpectedly.

## 3. Best Practices for Using Macros and Fixtures

- Use `TEST()` for simple tests that do not need shared resources.
- Use `TEST_F()` with fixtures when you want to reuse setup or shared state.
- Use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` rather than constructors/destructors if initialization might fail and you want controlled test execution.
- Name your test suites and tests clearly following C++ naming conventions.
- Avoid using underscores in test names to prevent macro conflicts and for consistency.
- Keep fixtures lean to minimize coupling between tests.

## 4. Advanced Fixture Usage

### 4.1 Sharing Resources Across Multiple Tests

Place common test data or helper functions in the fixture class to avoid duplication.

### 4.2 Using `static` Members with Fixtures

If you need static shared state, declare it inside the fixture class, but use with caution to prevent test inter-dependencies.

### 4.3 Parameterized Tests (Note)

While not directly in the scope of this page, parameterized tests extend `TEST_F` to run the same test logic with different inputs. Refer to [Organizing and Running Test Suites](../../guides/core-testing-workflows/organizing-and-running-tests) for more.

## 5. Typical User Workflows

<Steps>
<Step title="Writing a Simple Test">
1. Use `TEST()` to define a simple, independent test.
2. Add assertions to verify your code's behavior.
3. Run the tests with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
</Step>
<Step title="Using a Test Fixture">
1. Define a fixture class deriving from `testing::Test`.
2. Initialize shared members in the constructor or `SetUp()`.
3. Write tests with `TEST_F()` accessing the fixture's members.
4. Use `TearDown()` to free resources.
5. Run tests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### 6.1 Misspelling `SetUp` or `TearDown`

- Remember to capitalize correctly (`SetUp`, not `Setup`).
- Use `override` keyword to catch mistakes during compilation.

### 6.2 Forgetting to Use `TEST_F` with Fixtures

- `TEST()` does not give access to fixture members.
- Always use `TEST_F()` when accessing fixture data.

### 6.3 Relying on Shared State Between Tests

- Each test runs on a fresh fixture — do not assume state is shared accidentally.
- Use static members explicitly if needed, managing their lifetime carefully.

### 6.4 Test Names with Underscores

- Avoid underscores in test suite or test names to reduce macro parsing issues.

## 7. Summary

The test macros and fixture mechanism are foundational to structuring GoogleTest-based tests. Use `TEST` for straightforward independent tests and `TEST_F` with fixtures to share setup and teardown logic for related tests. Following the lifecycle and naming best practices ensures your tests are maintainable, clear, and robust.

## Example: Using TEST and TEST_F

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple independent test
TEST(SimpleMathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

// Test fixture to share Queue object
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    q_.Enqueue(100);
  }

  Queue<int> q_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, HasInitialElement) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q_.size(), 1);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, CanDequeue) {
  int* val = q_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 100);
  delete val;
}
```

This shows the power and clarity gained by fixtures versus simple tests.
