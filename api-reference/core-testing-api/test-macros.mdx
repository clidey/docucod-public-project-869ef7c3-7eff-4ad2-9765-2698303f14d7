# Test and Fixture Macros Reference

This reference page covers essential GoogleTest macros related to test and fixture definitions, including `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P`. It explains their parameters, lifecycle hooks, and integration with test discovery, helping you organize test suites and write effective test cases.

---

## Overview of Test Macros

GoogleTest provides specialized macros to define tests and fixtures that closely align with common C++ testing workflows. These macros serve three main purposes:

- Define independent test cases with no shared state.
- Define test fixtures with reusable setup/teardown logic.
- Define parameterized tests to run the same code against multiple inputs.

The most common macros are:

| Macro    | Purpose                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `TEST`   | Defines a simple, standalone test case.           |
| `TEST_F` | Defines a test using a test fixture class.        |
| `TEST_P` | Defines a parameterized test using test fixture.  |

### TEST Macro

Use `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` to define a basic test case. Each test is independent, runs in its own scope, and is automatically registered for discovery.

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(4, 2 + 2);
}
```

- `TestSuiteName` groups related tests.
- `TestName` uniquely identifies the test.

### TEST_F Macro

Use `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)` to define a test that uses a fixture class. A fixture allows you to encapsulate common setup and teardown code used by multiple tests.

A test fixture class must inherit from `testing::Test` and can override lifecycle hooks such as `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.

**Example:**

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db_.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db_.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db_;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_.Insert("record_key", "record_value"));
}
```

Here, the `InsertRecord` test uses the shared setup of connecting to a database.

### TEST_P Macro

`TEST_P` is used for parameterized tests, which run the same test logic multiple times with different parameters.

To use `TEST_P`, do the following:

1. Define a fixture class inheriting from `testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
2. Use `TEST_P` to define the test case.
3. Instantiate the test suite with specific parameter values using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

**Example:**

```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

This runs the `ReturnsTrueForEvenNumbers` test for each value in `Values`.

## Lifecycle Hooks

Test fixtures provide lifecycle methods you can override to customize setup and teardown:

| Hook      | When It Runs                        | Purpose                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `SetUp()` | Runs before every test in fixture  | Initialize test state                 |
| `TearDown()` | Runs after every test in fixture  | Cleanup after a test                  |
| `SetUpTestSuite()` | Runs once before all tests in fixture  | Shared expensive setup                |
| `TearDownTestSuite()` | Runs once after all tests in fixture   | Shared teardown                      |

**Example:**

```cpp
class ComplexTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Expensive initialization
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Cleanup
  }
};
```

Using suite-level hooks reduces repeated setup costs.

## Integration with Test Discovery

Tests defined with `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P` macros are automatically registered for discovery and execution by the GoogleTest framework. Each macro expands to static registration code that enables this seamless integration.

This automatic discovery simplifies test execution and integration with CI systems.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Choose `TEST` when no shared setup is needed.
- Use `TEST_F` for sharing setup, common state, or teardown code.
- Use `TEST_P` for parameterized tests covering multiple input variations.
- Prefer expressive and descriptive names for test suites and cases.
- Set up expensive shared resources in `SetUpTestSuite` and teardown in `TearDownTestSuite`.
- Avoid side effects in setup/teardown to prevent flaky tests.
- Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for named parameter sets in `TEST_P` tests.
- Write small, focused tests within fixtures to enhance readability and maintainability.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Test not discovered:** Make sure tests use one of the official macros and link against GoogleTest properly.
- **Setup not running:** Confirm fixture classes properly override the lifecycle methods with `override`.
- **Parametrized test not running:** Ensure `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` is present and parameters are valid.
- **Order dependent tests:** Avoid relying on test execution order; use sequences in mocks if needed.

## Summary

This page covered the GoogleTest macros for defining tests and fixtures:

- `TEST` for simple test cases.
- `TEST_F` for tests using fixtures.
- `TEST_P` for parameterized tests.

You learned about lifecycle hooks, suite-level setup/teardown, and how these macros integrate with GoogleTest's test discovery system. Practical examples and best practices equip you to organize your tests efficiently and effectively.

## Code Example - Combining Macros

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Calculator {
 public:
  virtual ~Calculator() = default;
  virtual int Add(int a, int b) = 0;
};

class MockCalculator : public Calculator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), (override));
};

// Using TEST macro for a simple test
TEST(SimpleTest, BasicAssertions) {
  EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);
}

// Using TEST_F with fixture for tests requiring setup
class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  MockCalculator mock_calc;

  void SetUp() override {
    // Optional common setup
  }
};

TEST_F(CalculatorTest, AddReturnsSum) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_calc, Add(3, 4)).WillOnce(::testing::Return(7));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_calc.Add(3, 4), 7);
}

// Using TEST_P for parameterized tests
class AddParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<int, int, int>> {};

TEST_P(AddParamTest, AddsCorrectly) {
  int a, b, expected;
  std::tie(a, b, expected) = GetParam();
  MockCalculator mock_calc;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_calc, Add(a, b)).WillOnce(::testing::Return(expected));
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_calc.Add(a, b), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    AddTests,
    AddParamTest,
    ::testing::Values(
      std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3),
      std::make_tuple(10, 20, 30),
      std::make_tuple(-1, -2, -3)
    )
);
```

## Further Enhancements

Explore defining custom fixtures, handling complex parameterization, and integrating parameterized tests with mocks for full test coverage.

Switching between `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` mock objects lets you control the strictness of uninteresting call warnings. See the [Mocking Reference](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/mocking) for more.
