# Assertion Macros

This reference documents all built-in assertion macros provided by GoogleTest, detailing their usage, distinctions between fatal and non-fatal failures, predicate assertions, user-defined assertions, and practical examples. These macros enable you to verify program correctness with clear, actionable feedback when assertions fail.

---

## 1. Assertion Overview

GoogleTest assertion macros check program conditions during tests and report failures when conditions aren't met. They fall into two categories based on failure severity:

- **Fatal Failures (`ASSERT_*`)**: Abort the current function immediately when they fail, stopping further test execution within that function.
- **Non-Fatal Failures (`EXPECT_*`)**: Report failure but allow the current function to continue execution.

Use `ASSERT_*` when continuing the test after failure makes no sense, and `EXPECT_*` when you want to collect multiple errors before aborting.

All assertion macros support streaming a custom failure message with the `<<` operator to provide detailed context.

---

## 2. Basic Assertion Macros

### 2.1 Explicit Success and Failure

These macros generate explicit success or failure regardless of a particular condition.

- **`SUCCEED()`**: Marks an explicit success within a test.

  ```cpp
  SUCCEED();
  SUCCEED() << "This test succeeded.";
  ```

- **`FAIL()`**: Generates a fatal failure that aborts the current function.

  ```cpp
  if (!ready) {
    FAIL() << "Setup failed, aborting test.";
  }
  ```

- **`ADD_FAILURE()`**: Generates a non-fatal failure, allowing the test to continue.

  ```cpp
  if (condition_unexpected) {
    ADD_FAILURE() << "Got unexpected condition.";
  }
  ```

- **`ADD_FAILURE_AT(file, line)`**: Generates a non-fatal failure at a specific file and line number.

  ```cpp
  ADD_FAILURE_AT("my_file.cc", 42) << "Incorrect argument.";
  ```

### 2.2 Boolean Condition Assertions

Used to verify conditions expected to be true or false.

| Macro         | Description                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`  | Checks that `condition` is true; continues on failure |
| `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`  | Checks that `condition` is true; aborts on failure    |
| `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` | Checks that `condition` is false; continues on failure|
| `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)` | Checks that `condition` is false; aborts on failure   |

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_ready) << "Ready flag was false.";
ASSERT_FALSE(has_error) << "Unexpected error occurred.";
```

### 2.3 Binary Comparison Assertions

These verify relationships between two values. When an assertion fails, values are printed if possible.

| Macro         | Meaning                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` | `val1 == val2`                               |
| `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)` | `val1 == val2`, aborts on failure            |
| `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` |  `val1 != val2`                              |
| `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)` |  `val1 != val2` aborts on failure             |
| `EXPECT_LT(val1, val2)` |  `val1 < val2`                               |
| `ASSERT_LT(val1, val2)` |  `val1 < val2`, aborts on failure             |
| `EXPECT_LE(val1, val2)` |  `val1 <= val2`                              |
| `ASSERT_LE(val1, val2)` |  `val1 <= val2`, aborts on failure             |
| `EXPECT_GT(val1, val2)` |  `val1 > val2`                               |
| `ASSERT_GT(val1, val2)` |  `val1 > val2`, aborts on failure             |
| `EXPECT_GE(val1, val2)` |  `val1 >= val2`                              |
| `ASSERT_GE(val1, val2)` |  `val1 >= val2`, aborts on failure             |

**C String comparisons note:** When you want to compare C strings by content, use `EXPECT_STREQ` or `EXPECT_STRNE`. Using `EXPECT_EQ` on pointers compares addresses, not content.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(result.size(), expected_size) << "Size mismatch.";
ASSERT_LT(score, max_score) << "Score too high.";
```

### 2.4 String Comparisons

Special macros exist for comparing C strings (including wide strings). These macros compare the contents rather than addresses.

| Macro           | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` | Strings equal                            |
| `ASSERT_STREQ(str1, str2)` | Strings equal, aborts on failure         |
| `EXPECT_STRNE(str1, str2)` | Strings not equal                          |
| `ASSERT_STRNE(str1, str2)` | Strings not equal, aborts on failure       |
| `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)` | Case-insensitive string equality        |
| `ASSERT_STRCASEEQ(str1, str2)` | Case-insensitive string equality aborting |
| `EXPECT_STRCASENE(str1, str2)` | Case-insensitive string inequality      |
| `ASSERT_STRCASENE(str1, str2)` | Case-insensitive string inequality aborting |

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_STREQ(expected.c_str(), result.c_str()) << "Strings do not match.";
ASSERT_STRCASEEQ("hello", user_input) << "Input case mismatch.";
```

### 2.5 Floating-Point Comparisons

Due to rounding errors, special assertions compare floating-point values approximately.

| Macro               | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)`   | Compares `float`s within 4 ULPs                  |
| `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ(val1, val2)`   | Same as above; aborts on failure                   |
| `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)`  | Compares `double`s within 4 ULPs                 |
| `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(val1, val2)`  | Same as above; aborts on failure                   |
| `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` | Checks difference ≤ `abs_error`                  |
| `ASSERT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` | Same as above; aborts on failure               |

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_NEAR(calculated_pi, 3.14159, 1e-5) << "Pi calculation off.";
ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ(expected_val, actual_val) << "Values differ.";
```

### 2.6 Exception Assertions

Verify that code throws or does not throw exceptions (requires exception support).

| Macro             | Description                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)`  | Expects exception of given type   |
| `ASSERT_THROW(statement, exception_type)`  | Same as above; aborts on failure 
| `EXPECT_ANY_THROW(statement)`              | Expects any exception             |
| `ASSERT_ANY_THROW(statement)`              | Same as above; aborts on failure |
| `EXPECT_NO_THROW(statement)`               | Expects no exception             |
| `ASSERT_NO_THROW(statement)`               | Same as above; aborts on failure |

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(func_that_throws(), std::runtime_error);
ASSERT_NO_THROW(func_that_does_not_throw());
```

### 2.7 Predicate Assertions

When you want to use custom predicates for more descriptive failure messages or difficult-to-express checks, use predicate assertions. They evaluate the predicate and print argument values on failure.

- **Basic predicates (return `bool`)**

  ```cpp
  EXPECT_PRED1(predicate, arg1);
  EXPECT_PRED2(predicate, arg1, arg2);
  // ... up to 5 arguments
  ```

- **Predicate Formatters (return `AssertionResult`)**

  Allows more control over failure message formatting.

  ```cpp
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(predicate_formatter, arg1);
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT2(predicate_formatter, arg1, arg2);
  // ... up to 5 arguments
  ```

Example with a predicate:

```cpp
bool IsPositive(int n) { return n > 0; }
EXPECT_PRED1(IsPositive, value);
```

Example with predicate-formatter:

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(const char* expr, int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " evaluates to odd number " << n;
}
EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, value);
```

### 2.8 Windows HRESULT Assertions

Specialized for Windows, these check HRESULTs for success or failure and report human-readable messages.

| Macro                    | Description                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `EXPECT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(expr)` | Checks `expr` is a success HRESULT  |
| `ASSERT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(expr)` | As above, aborts on failure           |
| `EXPECT_HRESULT_FAILED(expr)`    | Checks `expr` is a failure HRESULT |
| `ASSERT_HRESULT_FAILED(expr)`    | As above, aborts on failure           |

Example:

```cpp
CComPtr<IShellDispatch2> shell;
ASSERT_HRESULT_SUCCEEDED(shell.CoCreateInstance(L"Shell.Application"));
```

## 3. Usage Best Practices and Tips

### 3.1 Fatal vs Non-Fatal Assert Usage

- Use `ASSERT_*` macros when failure means continuing the test is pointless or dangerous (e.g., accessing invalid pointers).
- Use `EXPECT_*` macros when the test should continue to find multiple failures.

### 3.2 Streaming Custom Failure Messages

Add detailed context to help debugging failures:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected) << "Expected value at index " << i << " differs.";
```

Avoid complex expressions inside message streams to prevent side effects.

### 3.3 Assertion in Void-Returning Functions

Fatal assertions can only be used inside functions returning `void`. Using them in functions with return types produces compile errors. For non-void functions, use non-fatal assertions or restructure the code.

### 3.4 Using Predicate Assertions for Complex Condition Checks

Prefer predicate or predicate-format assertions over `EXPECT_TRUE` with a complex condition for better error output and single evaluation.

### 3.5 Checking for Failures in Helper Functions

Use `HasFatalFailure()` to check if any previous fatal failure occurred before proceeding.

Example:

```cpp
void Helper() {
  ASSERT_TRUE(Init());
}

TEST(MyTest, Example) {
  Helper();
  if (testing::Test::HasFatalFailure()) return;
  ...
}
```

### 3.6 Skipping Tests at Runtime

Use `GTEST_SKIP()` macro to skip tests dynamically based on runtime conditions, optionally streaming messages.

---

## 4. Practical Examples

### 4.1 Basic Assert and Expect

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Use ASSERT_* when preconditions must prevent test continuation.
  ASSERT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1) << "Factorial of 0 should be 1.";

  // Use EXPECT_* to report errors but continue testing.
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
}
```

### 4.2 String Assertion

```cpp
const char* result = GetString();
EXPECT_STREQ("expected", result) << "Unexpected string content.";
```

### 4.3 Predicate Assertion Using a Custom Predicate

```cpp
bool IsEven(int number) { return number % 2 == 0; }

TEST(MyTest, IsEvenCheck) {
  int val = 3;
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, val) << "Value is not even.";
}
```

### 4.4 Predicate-Formatter for Detailed Failure Messages

```cpp
testing::AssertionResult IsPositive(const char* expr, int val) {
  if (val > 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << expr << " evaluates to non-positive value: " << val;
}

TEST(MyTest, PositiveCheck) {
  int val = -1;
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsPositive, val);
}
```

### 4.5 Exception Assertion

```cpp
void ThrowsRuntimeError() { throw std::runtime_error("fail"); }

TEST(ExceptionTest, Throws) {
  EXPECT_THROW(ThrowsRuntimeError(), std::runtime_error);
  ASSERT_ANY_THROW(ThrowsRuntimeError());
}
```

---

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Fatal assertions in non-void functions cause compilation errors**: Switch to `EXPECT_*` or refactor the function to return `void`.

- **Using `EXPECT_EQ` with C strings compares pointers, not contents**: Use `EXPECT_STREQ` for string content comparison.

- **Fatal assertions inside constructors/destructors do not abort tests as expected**: Use `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` methods and place fatal assertions there.

- **Predicate assertion arguments executed multiple times**: Ensure your predicate functions do not evaluate arguments more than once; predicate assertions guarantee single evaluation.

- **No tests executed due to filters**: Verify your `--gtest_filter` is correct and not excluding all tests.
