# Error Handling and Failure Reporting

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide comprehensive mechanisms to represent, handle, and report errors and failures encountered during test execution. This page details the frameworkâ€™s approach to error categorization, reporting formats, and utilities allowing you to customize failure handling.

---

## 1. Understanding Error and Failure Types

GoogleTest differentiates errors encountered in tests into **fatal** and **non-fatal** failures, enabling fine-grained control over test execution flow.

- **Fatal Failures**: Triggered by assertions like `ASSERT_*`. They abort the current function, preventing subsequent statements from running.
- **Non-Fatal Failures**: Triggered by `EXPECT_*` assertions. They log the failure but allow the current test or function to continue.

Failure reporting covers:

- **Assertion failures**: Verification failures due to unmet conditions.
- **Uninteresting Calls**: Calls to mocks without expectations, leading to warnings.
- **Unexpected Calls**: Calls to mocks that don't match any expectation, resulting in errors.

Properly distinguishing between these helps you understand test outcomes and control test flow with clarity.

<Info>
The difference between fatal and non-fatal failures largely hinges on whether the test function can continue executing after the failure, facilitating flexible testing strategies.

## 2. Failure Reporting and Status Codes

GoogleTest records detailed result information for every test, represented by status codes that you can programmatically inspect:

| Status          | Meaning                                                    |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kSuccess`      | Test passed without failures.                              |
| `kNonFatalFailure` | One or more non-fatal failures occurred, but test continues. |
| `kFatalFailure` | A fatal failure occurred; test execution halted.          |

These codes enable conditional logic in custom test frameworks or listeners.

---

## 3. Mock Failure Scenarios and Reporting

Mock objects powered by GoogleMock distinguish between **uninteresting calls** and **unexpected calls**:

- **Uninteresting Calls**: Mock methods called without any preceding `EXPECT_CALL` specification. These produce a warning message and perform the default action (which could be to return default values or do nothing).
     - By default, naggy mocks warn on these calls.
     - Using `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
     - Using `StrictMock` converts uninteresting calls into errors.

- **Unexpected Calls**: Occur when a mock method is called but arguments do not satisfy any defined expectations. These cause test failures immediately, providing detailed diagnostics including:
     - Function call description
     - Expected argument values and call counts
     - Stack traces (if enabled)

### Example: Uninteresting Call Warning

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
nice_mock.SomeMethod();  // No EXPECT_CALL, no warning.

MockFoo raw_mock;
raw_mock.SomeMethod();   // Warning: Uninteresting mock function call.
```

### Example: Unexpected Call Failure

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(5));
// Actual call with different argument
mock.Func(10);  // Test failure with detailed diagnostic output
```

<Note>
The verbose diagnostic output can be controlled with `--gmock_verbose` flag set to `info`, `warning`, or `error`.
</Note>

## 4. Handling Excessive and Retired Expectations

### Excessive Calls

When a mock method is called more times than specified by its cardinality (for example, more than once when `.Times(1)` is set), GoogleMock reports an error, returning the default value or performing the default action.

### Retired Expectations

Expectations can be marked as **retiring on saturation** via `.RetiresOnSaturation()`. Once saturated, they no longer match calls. Calls that match retired expectations lead to failure reporting that clearly explains the retired state.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();

mock.Func(1); // Matches
mock.Func(2); // Matches, expectation retires
mock.Func(3); // Fails, as previous expectation retired
```

---

## 5. Verbosity and Detailed Logging Controls

GoogleMock supports a `--gmock_verbose` runtime flag to control the verbosity of mock function call logging:

| Level    | Effect                                                       |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `info`   | Logs detailed info and stack traces for expected and uninteresting calls.
| `warning`| Logs warnings for uninteresting calls without stack traces (default).
| `error`  | Logs only errors; suppresses warnings and info messages.

This helps you tune the noise level during debugging or routine testing.

---

## 6. Asserting Failures in Tests

GoogleTest offers macros to assert on test outcomes programmatically:

- `EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` checks that executing `statement` produces a nonfatal failure including the given `substring`.
- `EXPECT_FATAL_FAILURE(statement, substring)` likewise checks for fatal failures.

These facilitate writing tests on test utilities or custom assertions.

---

## 7. Utilities for Managing Mock Expectations

GoogleMock includes utility functions:

- `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(mock_object)`: Verifies that all expectations on a mock object have been satisfied and clears them.
- `Mock::VerifyAndClear(mock_object)`: Verifies and clears both expectations and default actions.
- `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_object)`: Prevents mock leak errors for intentionally leaked mock objects.

Use these to control the lifecycle of mocks in complex test scenarios, such as when mocks are shared or destroyed manually.

---

## 8. Best Practices for Failure Handling

- Use `EXPECT_CALL` sparingly to specify only the calls your test truly cares about; prefer `ON_CALL` for default behaviors.
- To suppress warnings about uninteresting calls, use `NiceMock`.
- For strict call validation, use `StrictMock`.
- Leverage `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to avoid upper-bound call count errors in repeated call scenarios.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` during development for detailed call tracing, but lower verbosity for CI pipelines.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Failure Scenarios

- **Unmatched Arguments**: Carefully check your matchers in `EXPECT_CALL` to ensure arguments match exactly what is sent.
- **Unexpected Calls**: May occur from missing or incomplete expectations; consider adding catch-all expectations like `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` when appropriate.
- **Memory Leaks on Mocks**: Use `Mock::AllowLeak` for mocks intentionally leaked in death tests or similar contexts.

### Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Error Scenarios">
<Accordion title="Unexpected mock function call">
Verify that your `EXPECT_CALL` matchers correctly correspond to call arguments and are not shadowed by other expectations with broader matchers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Uninteresting call warnings">
Use `NiceMock` for tests where certain mock methods don't require strict expectations or add `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())` for those methods.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Multiple expectations on the same method">
Watch for call order and priority; newer `EXPECT_CALL`s override older ones. Arrange calls accordingly or use `InSequence` to force ordering.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Mock leaks detected at exit">
Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to indicate intentional leaks, especially when mocks live beyond test lifetimes (e.g., in death tests).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Call count mismatches">
Check your `.Times()` specifications and ensure method invocation counts match expectations, or use `AtLeast()` and `AnyNumber()` when relaxing constraints.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example: Handling Unexpected Calls

```cpp
using ::testing::_;  

class MockCalculator {
public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), ());
};

TEST(CalculatorTest, UnexpectedCallExample) {
  MockCalculator mock_calc;

  // Expect Add to be called with 3 and 4.
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_calc, Add(3, 4));

  // Call succeeds.
  mock_calc.Add(3, 4);

  // Call with unexpected arguments - triggers failure.
  mock_calc.Add(1, 2);
}
```

Running this test produces an error detailing the unexpected call and the expected arguments.

---

### Example: Using `RetiresOnSaturation` to Avoid Call Count Errors

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Process(42))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();

mock_obj.Process(42);  // matches
mock_obj.Process(42);  // matches and retires the expectation
mock_obj.Process(42);  // matches a fallback expectation or fails if none
```

This allows successive calls to be handled neatly without exceeding upper bounds.
