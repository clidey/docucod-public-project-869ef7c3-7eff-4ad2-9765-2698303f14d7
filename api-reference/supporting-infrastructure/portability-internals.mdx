# Portability and Internal Utilities

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to operate reliably and consistently across varied platforms and toolchains. This page documents the API interfaces, macros, and low-level utilities that underlie that portability. These internal utilities support deep integration, enable cross-platform compatibility, and facilitate debugging by exposing flags and constructs relevant to platform-specific behavior.

---

## Overview

This set of APIs and macros provides the foundational building blocks that ensure GoogleTest and GoogleMock function uniformly across different operating systems, compilers, and environments. They include:

- Platform detection macros and environment configuration
- Thread and synchronization utilities
- Command line flag declaration, parsing, and management
- Internal definitions safeguarding compatibility

All these components are intended primarily for internal use or advanced users who require granular control over GoogleMock’s and GoogleTest’s behavior when integrating into complex environments.

> **Important:** Most symbols and macros here are considered internal and subject to change; they should generally not be used directly in user code.


## Portability Utilities

### Platform and Compiler Macros

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide comprehensive platform-identification macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, and others, auto-detected during compilation. These macros allow conditional compilation and enable toolchain-specific accommodations.

Similarly, macros determine feature support such as:

- Exception handling availability (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`)
- POSIX threads support (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`)
- RTTI status (`GTEST_HAS_RTTI`)
- Stream redirection capability (`GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION`)

These macros are used inside the framework to select platform-specific implementations or disable unsupported features.


### Synchronization and Threading

GoogleTest’s internal threading utilities abstract over differences in thread and mutex APIs across platforms. For example:

- On Windows, `Mutex` uses native OS synchronization primitives.
- On POSIX systems, `Mutex` wraps pthread mutexes.
- Where threading is unsupported, no-op implementations prevent build errors.

GoogleTest also provides a `ThreadLocal<T>` template implementing thread-local storage in a platform-agnostic manner.


### Command Line Flag Handling

GoogleMock uses an internal flag management system compatible with or without Abseil. Key features include:

- Macros for declaring and defining flags (`GMOCK_DECLARE_bool_`, `GMOCK_DEFINE_string_`, etc.).
- APIs for reading (`GMOCK_FLAG_GET(name)`) and setting (`GMOCK_FLAG_SET(name, value)`) flag values programmatically.

Internally, GoogleMock defines and manages flags such as:

- `gmock_verbose` — controls verbosity of logs
- `catch_leaked_mocks` — enables leak detection of mocks
- `default_mock_behavior` — controls default mock call behavior

Flags are parsed and removed from program arguments when calling `InitGoogleMock()`, allowing seamless integration with user test executables.


## Key Macros and Interfaces

### Flag Macros

To define a flag, GoogleMock uses:

```cpp
GMOCK_DEFINE_bool_(verbose, false, "Enables verbose logging");
```

To declare for use in other translation units:

```cpp
GMOCK_DECLARE_bool_(verbose);
```

Flags are accessed via:

```cpp
bool is_verbose = GMOCK_FLAG_GET(verbose);
GMOCK_FLAG_SET(verbose, true);
```

### Platform Check Macros

Built on GoogleTest’s `gtest-port.h`, GoogleMock shares many portability macros including:

- Compilers: MSVC version checks, Clang, GCC
- OS platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, embedded OSes

Example usage:

```cpp
#if GTEST_OS_WINDOWS
  // Windows-specific code
#endif

#if GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS
  try { ... } catch (...) { ... }
#endif
```


### Initialization

`InitGoogleMock(int* argc, char** argv)` initializes GoogleMock and GoogleTest, parsing and removing GoogleMock-specific flags from the argument list. It ensures that `gmock_verbose` and other flags are correctly set before tests run.

Example:

```cpp
int argc = 3;
char* argv[] = {"test", "--gmock_verbose=info", "--gmock_default_mock_behavior=1"};
testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
```

After initialization, the flags are no longer part of `argv`.


## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Avoid relying on internal macros:** Portability macros and internal flags are primarily for GoogleTest and GoogleMock implementation. Use the public APIs and initialization functions.

- **Initialize GoogleMock early:** Call `InitGoogleMock()` at the start of your test executable to ensure all flags and environment factors are correctly configured.

- **Manage command-line integration:** If your test program processes command-line arguments, call `InitGoogleMock()` before parsing your own flags to avoid conflicts.

- **Be cautious with flag manipulation:** Using `GMOCK_FLAG_SET` changes the internal flags programmatically and should be done before initializing behavior or testing.


## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Flags not parsed:** If flags like `--gmock_verbose` do not affect behavior, ensure `InitGoogleMock` is called properly and argument arrays are correctly passed.

- **Platform misdetection:** If tests fail due to platform targeting errors, verify your compiler and build environment correctly define standard macros and that no custom defines override them incorrectly.

- **Threading issues:** On embedded or unsupported platforms, threading and thread-local storage might be no-op. Tests relying heavily on concurrency may not behave as expected.


## Example: Using Initialization and Flag Access

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);

  if (GMOCK_FLAG_GET(verbose)) {
    std::cout << "Verbose logging enabled." << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "Verbose logging disabled." << std::endl;
  }

  // Proceed with running tests.
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```
