# Internal Utilities and Extension Points

This documentation details the internal utility headers and extension mechanisms used by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It is designed primarily for power users, maintainers, and advanced developers who need to extend, debug, or deeply integrate with the testing infrastructure.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide internal utilities primarily in headers such as `gmock-matchers.h` and `gtest-internal.h`. These utilities underpin core functionality like matcher implementations, matcher casting, and the robust extension points enabling custom matchers, actions, and mock behavior.

This page does **not** document typical user-facing API like `EXPECT_CALL` or `MOCK_METHOD` directly, but focuses instead on the intricate internal components and patterns that power these APIs.

## Core Internal Utilities

### Matcher Implementation Mechanisms

GoogleMock's matcher system is architected around polymorphic matcher factories and monomorphic matcher implementations:

- Users typically work with polymorphic matchers defined via macros like `MATCHER(name, desc)` and `MATCHER_P(name, param, desc)`. These macros generate polymorphic factories that can produce matcher instances for various argument types.
- Internally, each matcher template defines an implementation class `gmock_Impl` templated on the argument type and implements the interface `MatcherInterface<T>`. This class provides `MatchAndExplain()`, `DescribeTo()`, and `DescribeNegationTo()` methods.
- Conversion between matchers of different types is handled explicitly via `MatcherCast<T>(m)` and its helper classes. These enable safe type conversions, preserving type safety and avoiding incorrect matcher usage.

### MatchResultListener

Matchers optionally explain match failures or successes using a listener interface `MatchResultListener`. The class `StringMatchResultListener` is an internal helper collecting explanation strings.

### Utility Functions and Traits

- Type traits like `KindOf<T>` and `LosslessArithmeticConvertible` support precise type conversions and safety in matcher casts.
- `GetRawPointer` extracts raw pointers from smart pointers or reference wrappers for deep pointer matchers like `Pointee()`.
- Containers and tuples are elegantly handled for tuple-matchers, field matchers, and container matchers through `StlContainerView`, `TuplePrefix`, `TupleMatches`, and internal tuple unpacking utilities.

## Extension Patterns for Power Users

This section outlines how advanced users can extend GoogleMock by creating new matchers, actions, and cardinalities using the internal mechanisms.

### Defining Custom Matchers Using MATCHER Macros

GoogleMock offers a family of macros — `MATCHER`, `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, etc. — to rapidly create matchers:

- The macro `MATCHER(Name, Description) { body }` creates a polymorphic matcher named `Name`. The `body` is code returning a boolean, with access to `arg` (the matched value) and supporting streams for additional explanations.
- Parameterized versions accept one or more parameters.
- The description string can accommodate dynamic negation and parameters for rich failure messages.

Example:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

// Usage:
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsEven()));
EXPECT_THAT(some_value, IsEven());
```

Advanced matchers can stream detailed mismatch info to `result_listener`, improving diagnostics.

### Implementing Monomorphic Matcher Classes Directly

For finer control or widely reused matchers, implement a class with the interface:

```cpp
class MyMatcher {
 public:
  using is_gtest_matcher = void;  // Required marker

  bool MatchAndExplain(const T& value, MatchResultListener* listener) const;
  void DescribeTo(std::ostream* os) const;
  void DescribeNegationTo(std::ostream* os) const;
};

::testing::Matcher<T> MyMatcherFactory();
```

This approach offers more explicit typing and clearer compiler errors.

### Composite and Parameterized Matchers

GoogleMock supports creating composite matchers that contain other matchers as parameters, e.g. `DistanceFrom(target, matcher)`. Such matchers store sub-matchers as `Matcher<const SubType&>` internally to allow describing their conditions.

These are implemented using the internal matcher interfaces and factories.

### Matcher Casting and Polymorphism

- `MatcherCast<T>(m)` allows explicit, safe casting between matcher types. It ensures the argument types can be converted safely, preventing invalid matchers.
- `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` is a more restrictive but safer casting that checks for implicit conversion and lossless narrowing.

These casting mechanisms are implemented internally with template helpers specializing different scenarios.

### Field and Property Matchers

Internal classes like `FieldMatcher` and `PropertyMatcher` enable matching specific object fields or property getters:

- `Field(&Class::field, matcher)` matches an object whose field is matched by `matcher`.
- `Property(&Class::method, matcher)` matches an object whose property obtained via method matches.

These support matching raw pointers targeting objects and provide clear diagnostic messages including field/property names.

### Container Matchers

GoogleMock supports numerous container-aware matchers, implemented internally:

- `ElementsAre`, `UnorderedElementsAre`, `Contains`, `Each`, `SizeIs`, `WhenSortedBy`, `Pointwise`, and variants.
- These rely on internal utilities like `StlContainerView` and `MatcherInterface` implementations.
- They provide detailed mismatch reporting on containers’ contents, sizes, and ordering.

### Advanced Matcher Utilities

- `TupleMatches` and `FieldsAreMatcher` provide detailed matching on tuples and aggregate structured bindings.
- `UnorderedElementsAreMatcherImpl` implements complex logic for unordered container matching.
- Special matchers like `Pointer`, `Address`, `Ref`, `NotNull`, and `IsNull` are polymorphic matchers supporting versatile scenarios.

### Result Listener and Explanation

Matchers can use the `MatchResultListener` to explain why a value matches or does not match. This is critical for making failure messages actionable and insightful.

## Practical Advice for Extending GoogleMock

- Always define matchers to be pure functions without side effects. Violating this will break tests unpredictably.
- Use provided macros for straightforward matchers. For more complex logic or polymorphic behaviors, implement the matcher interface.
- Stream additional explanatory info during match failures to improve test diagnostics.
- Use the internal matcher casting methods to safely handle type conversions for parameterized matchers.
- For container and tuple matching, rely on the internal utilities rather than reinventing the wheel.
- When implementing composite matchers, store sub-matchers as monomorphic matchers internally to preserve descriptive capability.

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- Incorrect matcher definitions can cause confusing compilation errors. Use the provided macros or implement interface methods explicitly.
- Passing parameters by reference requires care, especially for displaying failure messages (addresses are not shown, only values).
- Avoid side effects inside matchers. Matchers might be evaluated multiple times or not evaluated at all when a listener is inactive.
- When matching pointers, `Pointee()` will fail match if the pointer is `NULL`.
- Using `MatcherCast` bypasses strict type safety; prefer `SafeMatcherCast` unless necessary.

---

## Additional Internal Facilities

Beyond matchers, the internal headers include:

- Template utilities for tuple manipulation and applying functions to tuples.
- Base classes for lossless type conversion and type trait detection.
- Facilities to handle string comparisons, including case-insensitive variants and base64 unescaping.
- Matcher classes for matching floating-point approximate equality using ULP or epsilon tolerances.
- Matchers for dealing with pointers and smart pointers, including dynamic casts when RTTI is enabled.

These form the backbone for advanced GoogleMock capabilities and extensibility.

## Summary

This page decodes the internal extension and utility system powering GoogleMock and GoogleTest’s matcher infrastructure. Advanced users can leverage these for well-typed custom matchers, expressive diagnostics, polymorphic matcher factories, and container-aware matcher implementations.

For typical users, direct use is not necessary, but understanding these internals helps write robust, performant, and well-integrated custom matchers and actions.

Use the `MATCHER` and `MATCHER_P` macros for quick, expressive matcher definitions. For complex or performance-critical matchers, implement the matcher interface explicitly.
