# Test Configuration and Entrypoints

This page covers how to initialize, configure, and run tests in different build and platform scenarios using GoogleTest. It emphasizes integration with CI/CD pipelines, command-line flags, and how to leverage Abseil APIs when available to customize test behavior and control test execution flow.

---

## Initialization and Main Entrypoints

Successfully running GoogleTest-based tests requires a proper initialization sequence and entrypoint setup. This ensures all test suites and global test environments are correctly registered and configured before tests execute.

### Using `testing::InitGoogleTest()`

The standard way to initialize GoogleTest is to call:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- `InitGoogleTest()` parses recognized command-line flags, removing them from `argv` and adjusting `argc`.
- Initialization covers both GoogleTest and GoogleMock if using the `InitGoogleMock()` wrapper.

### Default Main Implementations

GoogleTest provides default main() implementations that you can link against:

- **gtest_main:** Provides a simple main() that initializes and runs all tests.
- **gmock_main:** Included with GoogleMock, initializes both GoogleMock and GoogleTest.

These let you focus on writing tests without manually defining the main entrypoint.

### Platform-Specific Entrypoints

For embedded platforms such as ESP8266, ESP32, or Arduino-based NRF52, GoogleMock provides platform-specific setup:

```cpp
extern "C" {
void setup() {
  testing::InitGoogleMock();
}
void loop() {
  RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
}
```

This design integrates naturally with platform-specific event loops.

---

## Command-Line Flags and Configuration

GoogleTest supports a rich set of command-line flags and environment variables that control test behavior and output.

### Initialization and Flag Parsing

- Must call `InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before running tests so all flags are correctly parsed and applied.
- Flags control filtering, repetition, shuffling, output formats, and more.

### Common Flags

| Flag                  | Purpose                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter`      | Runs a subset of tests matching a filter expression            |
| `--gtest_repeat`      | Repeats tests N times or forever if negative number            |
| `--gtest_shuffle`     | Randomizes test execution order                                |
| `--gtest_output`      | Specifies the output file format and location (XML or JSON)    |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure` | Triggers a breakpoint on first failure for easier debugging|
| `--gtest_color`       | Configures colored terminal output (yes/no/auto)               |

### Environment Variable Equivalents

Flags correspond with environment variables such as `GTEST_FILTER`, `GTEST_REPEAT`, and `GTEST_SHUFFLE`, with precedence given to command-line flags.

#### Example: Filtering and Running Specific Tests

```bash
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MySuite.MyTest
```
Runs only the test named `MyTest` inside the suite `MySuite`.

---

## Global Test Environments

GoogleTest supports global test environment objects for setup and teardown at the test program level.

### Defining Global Environments

Subclass `testing::Environment` and override:

- `SetUp()` — runs before any test executes
- `TearDown()` — runs after all tests finish

```cpp
class MyEnv : public testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // global initialization
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // global cleanup
  }
};
```

### Registering Global Environments

Add your environment before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Behavior

- If no tests are run (e.g., due to filtering), global `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` will not be called.
- If `SetUp()` fails fatally, no tests will run but `TearDown()` still runs.
- Multiple global environments can be registered; they run `SetUp()` in registration order and `TearDown()` in reverse order.

### Common Use Case

Global environments often manage expensive shared resources or external dependencies like database connections needed for tests.

## Command-Line Flags Integration in CI/CD

GoogleTest's flag system integrates smoothly with continuous integration pipelines:

- Test runners can filter tests to run relevant subsets.
- Repetition and sharding options allow flakiness detection and parallel execution.
- XML/JSON output can generate machine-readable reports consumed by CI servers.
- Failure exit codes allow for test result status checks.

### Example: Generating XML Report for CI

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

This creates an XML file compatible with many CI tools for reporting test results.

---

## Leveraging Abseil APIs

When GoogleTest is built with Abseil dependencies, it can utilize Abseil's command-line flag parsing and string utilities to enhance configuration and runtime behavior.

- Abseil flag integration allows consistent flag parsing with your project if it uses Abseil.
- Use `absl::GetFlag()` to programmatically query test flags.
- Abseil formatting utilities can improve logging and diagnostic output.

---

## Running Tests Programmatically

Sometimes, tests need to be run programmatically rather than through `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` alone.

- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` returns `0` if all tests pass, otherwise `1`.
- You can dynamically register tests at runtime before invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Use `testing::RegisterTest()` to add test cases dynamically.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  RegisterMyDynamicTests();

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to parse flags properly.
- Use global environments sparingly to manage expensive setup needed across tests.
- Employ filtering and repetition flags during development to quickly isolate failures.
- Use the default main implementations (`gtest_main` or `gmock_main`) unless custom setup is required.
- Integrate XML/JSON output with your CI tools for rich reporting.
- For embedded or special platforms, adjust main entrypoints accordingly (e.g., setup/loop for Arduino).
- When using parameterized or typed tests, ensure public access specifiers for setup methods.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Entrypoint Issues

- **If your tests do not run:** Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called and that filtering flags allow tests.
- **If flags are not recognized:** Confirm `InitGoogleTest()` is called with correct `argc` and `argv`.
- **If tests are skipped unexpectedly:** Check for fatal failures in global environment `SetUp()`.
- **If build errors occur in main:** Confirm linking against `gtest_main` or provide your own main.
- **If output is missing or unreadable:** Verify output flags are correct and output directories exist.
