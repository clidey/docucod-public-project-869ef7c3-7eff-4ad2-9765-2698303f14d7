# Essential Testing Macros

GoogleTest provides core macros that form the foundation of your test code. These macros not only define individual tests and test fixtures but also enable parameterized testing for enhanced flexibility and reuse. Understanding and effectively using these macros is crucial for organizing test suites, structuring test cases, and controlling test execution.

---

## 1. Defining Tests with `TEST`

The simplest way to write a test in GoogleTest is using the `TEST` macro. It defines a basic test case with no shared state or setup/teardown logic.

```cpp
TEST(TestCaseName, TestName) {
  // Test logic here
  EXPECT_EQ(foo, bar);
}
```

- **`TestCaseName`** groups related tests
- **`TestName`** identifies this specific test

### Key points:

- Each `TEST` macro expands into a function named `TestCaseName_TestName_Test`
- Tests are run independently, in no guaranteed order
- Use multiple `TEST`s within a `TestCaseName` to group logically related tests

### Example

```cpp
TEST(MathTests, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

TEST(MathTests, Subtraction) {
  EXPECT_EQ(5 - 3, 2);
}
```

In this example, two tests belong to the `MathTests` test case.

---

## 2. Using Test Fixtures with `TEST_F`

When you need to share common setup and teardown code or test state among multiple tests, you use **test fixtures**.

### Defining a test fixture class

```cpp
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  // Code here will be called immediately before each test
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize common state
  }

  // Code here will be called immediately after each test
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup common state
  }

  // Shared state
  int shared_value_;
};
```

### Writing tests using the fixture (`TEST_F` macro)

```cpp
TEST_F(FooTest, DoesSomething) {
  shared_value_ = 42;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_value_, 42);
}

TEST_F(FooTest, DoesSomethingElse) {
  shared_value_ = 5;
  EXPECT_GT(shared_value_, 0);
}
```

### Benefits

- Setup and teardown code runs before and after each test
- Test state can be stored as fixture member variables
- Promotes code reuse and cleaner tests

### Important notes

- Tests using a fixture must use `TEST_F`, not `TEST`
- Fixture methods `SetUp` and `TearDown` are `virtual`
- The fixture class must publicly inherit from `::testing::Test`

---

## 3. Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest supports parameterized tests, letting you run the same test logic with different inputs. This reduces duplication and captures numerous scenarios.

### Basics

1. Define a fixture class deriving from `::testing::TestWithParam<T>` where `T` is the parameter type.
2. Use `TEST_P` macro to write the parameterized test.
3. Instantiate the test suite with values using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### Example

```cpp
class IsEvenTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsEvenTest, HandlesEvenNumbers) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(n % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(EvenNumbers, IsEvenTest, ::testing::Values(2, 4, 6, 8));
```

This creates 4 tests, each running `HandlesEvenNumbers` with one of the values.

### Advanced options for instantiation

- `::testing::Values(...)`: Enumerate specific values
- `::testing::Range(start, end, step)`: Generate a sequence
- `::testing::ValuesIn(container)`: Use values from a container
- Custom generators using `::testing::Combine` or `::testing::Apply` for tuple-based parameters

### Useful tips

- Test names include parameter values for clarity
- Keep parameter types simple and printable
- You can override `PrintToStringParamName` to customize parameter output

## 4. Control Macros

Besides test definition, GoogleTest offers macros for finer control:

- `DISABLED_TEST` and `DISABLED_TEST_F`: Temporarily disable tests
- `GTEST_SKIP()`: Skip tests at runtime under conditions
- `TEST_F(..., ...)` with `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite`: Define per-suite setup/teardown
- `ASSERT_*` and `EXPECT_*` macros: Control test failure behavior (fatal vs non-fatal)

Example of disabling a test:

```cpp
TEST(MathTests, DISABLED_Multiplication) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 * 3, 6);
}
```

This test will not run but remains in the test suite.

---

## 5. Structuring Your Tests

Use testing macros not only to define your tests but to organize your test code:

- Group related tests into test cases using `TEST` or test fixtures with `TEST_F`
- Write clean setup and teardown logic in fixtures
- Use parameterized tests to cover input variations
- Name tests clearly reflecting their purpose

Your tests become more readable, maintainable, and clear.

---

## Summary

GoogleTest's essential macros empower you to define, organize, and control tests effectively:

- `TEST`: Simple, independent test cases
- `TEST_F`: Tests using shared fixtures
- `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`: Parameterized tests
- Control macros to disable, skip, or set up/tear down tests

Mastering these macros is fundamental to writing robust, maintainable automated tests.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Verify that `TEST_F` is used when test needs a fixture
- Avoid defining shared test state outside fixtures
- When parameterizing, ensure parameters are printable for easy diagnosis
- Use clear and consistent test naming for easy debugging

## Example: Combining `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and Parameterized Tests

```cpp
// Basic test
TEST(ExampleTest, SimpleCheck) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}

// Test fixture
class VectorTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  std::vector<int> v_;

  void SetUp() override {
    v_ = {1, 2, 3};
  }
};

TEST_F(VectorTest, SizeIsThree) {
  EXPECT_EQ(v_.size(), 3);
}

// Parameterized test
class IsOddTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(IsOddTest, CheckOdd) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(OddNumbers, IsOddTest, ::testing::Values(1, 3, 5));
```

This pattern covers simple tests, reused setup, and parameterized inputs efficiently.
