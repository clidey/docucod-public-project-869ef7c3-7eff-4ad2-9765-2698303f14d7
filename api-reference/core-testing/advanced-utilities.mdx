# Advanced Utilities & Death Tests

GoogleTest equips users with powerful advanced features that enable testing scenarios beyond regular unit tests, ensuring robustness in complex and critical software. This documentation page guides you through advanced utilities such as death tests to verify program exit conditions, custom test environment configurations, and extending GoogleTest with event listeners.

---

## Death Tests

Death tests are designed to verify that your program terminates as expected in certain scenarios. These tests allow you to assert that a statement or function causes the program to exit, typically due to fatal errors, invalid operations, or assertion failures.

### When to Use Death Tests

Use death tests to ensure your program:

- Safely aborts under invalid usage or conditions.
- Correctly handles fatal assertions or exceptions.
- Terminates when critical invariants are violated.

Death tests prevent undefined or unsafe behavior by validating that expected program exits truly occur.

### Writing Death Tests

GoogleTest provides the `EXPECT_DEATH` and `ASSERT_DEATH` macros to check that a piece of code exits the program and optionally emits a specified error message.

```cpp
// Verifies that calling Foo("bad input") terminates the program
EXPECT_DEATH(Foo("bad input"), "Invalid input detected");

// Asserts that Bar crashes and logs a message that contains "Fatal error"
ASSERT_DEATH(Bar(), "Fatal error");
```

The first parameter is a statement or callable that should cause the program to exit. The second parameter is a regex pattern that the error output must match.

### Practical Tips

- **Use ASSERT_DEATH** when the test cannot continue after the death-triggering statement.
- **Use EXPECT_DEATH** for non-fatal death checks, which allow other assertions to run.
- Match error messages precisely but allow flexibility with regex to accommodate varied outputs.
- Death tests run the tested code in a subprocess to safely catch termination.

### Common Pitfalls

- Death tests may fail silently if the tested code does not actually kill the process.
- Overly restrictive regex patterns may cause false failures.
- Death tests can be slower due to process spawning - limit their use to critical paths.

## Custom Test Environments

GoogleTest permits configuring and managing test environments through the `::testing::Environment` class. This allows setting up and tearing down global fixtures or resources that affect multiple tests.

### Defining a Custom Environment

Derive a class from `::testing::Environment` and override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`:

```cpp
class MyEnv : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize shared resources, e.g. database connections
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup shared resources
  }
};
```

### Registering an Environment

Before running tests, register your environment:

```cpp
::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnv);
```

GoogleTest guarantees `SetUp()` is called before any tests run, and `TearDown()` after all tests finish.

### Use Cases

- Setting up hardware or software dependencies shared across tests
- Initializing logging systems or test databases
- Configuring global state or flags

---

## Test Event Listeners

GoogleTest supports extension through event listeners, which can inspect or react to test events such as start and completion of tests or test cases.

### Custom Event Listener

Derive from `::testing::TestEventListener` or `::testing::EmptyTestEventListener` and override needed methods:

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting test: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }

  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished test: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};
```

### Attaching Event Listeners

Replace or append listeners to the test framework:

```cpp
::testing::TestEventListeners& listeners = ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
listeners.Append(new MyListener);
```

### Use Cases

- Custom reporting or logging
- Integrating with external monitoring tools
- Capturing metrics for tests

---

## Summary

Advanced GoogleTest utilities let you write more comprehensive tests by verifying program exits with death tests, managing global test resources via custom test environments, and extending test reporting or behaviors with event listeners. Implementing these features enhances safety, resource management, and observability in your testing suite.

## Troubleshooting Death Tests

- Ensure death tests run only when supported; some platforms or build modes may not support them fully.
- Increase verbosity with `--gtest_repeat` or `--gtest_shuffle` to diagnose flakiness.
- Validate the regex pattern carefully to avoid false negatives.

---

## Best Practices

- Use death tests exclusively for critical failure scenarios.
- Prefer minimal global environments to reduce test coupling.
- Leverage event listeners for non-invasive extensions.

---

## Example: Combined Death Test and Environment

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class MyEnvironment : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize resources
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up resources
  }
};

// The function that should trigger termination on bad input
void UnsafeOperation(int* ptr) {
  if (ptr == nullptr) {
    std::cerr << "Null pointer error" << std::endl;
    std::abort();
  }
  // Safe usage...
}

TEST(DeathTestSample, NullPointerCrash) {
  EXPECT_DEATH(UnsafeOperation(nullptr), "Null pointer error");
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnvironment);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```
