# Portability and Platform Utilities

GoogleTest provides a set of low-level APIs specifically designed to abstract away the complexities and inconsistencies between different platforms, compilers, and environments. This page documents these portability and platform utility APIs, enabling contributors and integrators to build, extend, and maintain GoogleTest in a robust and consistent manner across diverse operating systems and toolchains.

---

## Overview

The `Portability and Platform Utilities` APIs focus on:

- Abstracting platform differences such as Windows, Linux, Mac, and embedded systems.
- Managing compiler compatibility including various Microsoft, GCC, Clang, and other compiler idiosyncrasies.
- Providing synchronization primitives, thread-local storage, and process-level utilities through a unified interface.
- Handling environment detection, file system access, and stream redirection consistently across OSes.

These are **not** typical user-facing testing APIs but core building blocks for the framework's internals and for anyone integrating deeply with GoogleTest.


## 1. Platform and Compiler Abstraction Macros

GoogleTest detects and identifies the platform and compiler environment automatically but allows overrides via macros. Key macros include:

- **GTEST_OS_***: Platform detection macros identifying OS such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, etc.
- **GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD**: Determines the availability of POSIX threads.
- **GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS**: Detects if exception handling is enabled.
- **GTEST_HAS_RTTI**: Determines if C++ RTTI is supported.
- **GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION**: Controls support for stdout/stderr capturing.

These macros enable GoogleTest to adapt its implementation per platform.

### Practical Tip
If you encounter issues on unsupported or exotic platforms, manually defining these macros in your build environment can help GoogleTest behave correctly.


## 2. Synchronization Primitives

GoogleTest provides cross-platform synchronization utilities critical for thread-safe tests and internal state management.

### Mutex
- Implements a mutex locking mechanism with platform-specific backends: Windows Critical Sections, POSIX pthread mutexes, or no-ops on non-threadsafe builds.
- Use the `Mutex` and `MutexLock` classes to lock and unlock sections safely.

### Thread-Local Storage (`ThreadLocal<T>`)
- Provides per-thread storage abstraction.
- Automatically creates and destroys per-thread instances of objects.
- Supports default-initialized or user-supplied initial values.

### Thread utilities
- `GetThreadCount()` returns the number of active threads in the current process, if detectable.
- `ThreadWithParam<T>` is a helper class to launch threads with parameters, primarily for GoogleTest internal testing.


## 3. File and Environment Utilities

GoogleTest abstracts access to files and environment variables ensuring compatibility:

- **File utilities**
  - `FileNo(FILE* file)` retrieves the OS-level file descriptor.
  - `Stat()`, `RmDir()`, and `IsDir()` provide directory and file status inspection.
  - `GetFileSize()` and `ReadEntireFile()` read file contents safely across platforms.

- **Environment variables**
  - `GetEnv(const char* name)` retrieves environment variables, returns `nullptr` when unavailable or on embedded platforms.

- **Stream capture**
  - Functions like `CaptureStdout()`, `GetCapturedStdout()`, `CaptureStderr()`, and `GetCapturedStderr()` enable capturing of stdout and stderr output.


## 4. Character and String Utilities

To handle various platform and compiler-dependent character behaviors, GoogleTest provides utility functions:

- Character classification helpers such as `IsAlpha()`, `IsDigit()`, `IsSpace()`, and `IsXDigit()`, which safely handle signed/unsigned `char` conversions.
- Conversion helpers like `ToLower()`, `ToUpper()`.
- `StripTrailingSpaces(std::string)` trims trailing whitespace from strings.


## 5. Compile-Time and Language Feature Support

GoogleTest configures support for various C++ language features depending on compiler versions and standards:

- C++ standard version detection (minimum C++17 required).
- Feature detection macros for attributes such as `[[nodiscard]]`, `__has_attribute`, `__has_feature`, and others.
- Support detection for exceptions, RTTI, and wide string usage.


## 6. Regular Expression Support

GoogleTest internally uses several regex engines tailored for platform capabilities:

- **RE2-based** when built with Abseil support.
- **POSIX Extended Regex** on UNIX-like platforms.
- A **simple custom regex** fallback for others.

GoogleTest wraps regex functionality inside the `testing::internal::RE` class, offering uniform access to full and partial regex match operations.


## 7. Error Handling and Logging

Low-level macros and classes provide robust error checking and logging:

- `GTEST_CHECK_(condition)` performs assertions that abort the program on condition failures in all build modes.
- `GTEST_CHECK_POSIX_SUCCESS_(posix_call)` asserts POSIX calls return success.
- `GTestLog` class provides severity-based logging with automatic flushing and program abort on fatal errors.


## 8. Compiler and Build Environment Support

GoogleTest's CMake scripts and header macros collectively ensure consistent building across compilers:

- Tweaks default MSVC and Clang flags for warnings, exception handling, runtime linkage, and UTF-8 sources.
- Configures pthread usage on supported platforms.
- Controls shared/static library linkage macros such as `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY` and `GTEST_LINKED_AS_SHARED_LIBRARY`.


## Example Usage Scenarios

### Safely locking a mutex

```cpp
::testing::internal::Mutex mu;
{
  ::testing::internal::MutexLock lock(&mu);
  // Critical section: only one thread at a time here.
}
// Mutex is automatically released.
```

### Using thread-local storage

```cpp
// Each thread has its own instance of counter.
::testing::internal::ThreadLocal<int> counter(0);
counter.set(counter.get() + 1);
```

### Capturing standard output in tests

```cpp
::testing::internal::CaptureStdout();
printf("Hello GoogleTest!");
std::string output = ::testing::internal::GetCapturedStdout();
EXPECT_EQ(output, "Hello GoogleTest!");
```


## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Thread Safety**: Ensure `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro is enabled (set to 1) on your platform to use threading and synchronization features safely.
- **Stream Capturing**: Only one active stdout/stderr capturer can exist at a time; nested captures will trigger runtime failures.
- **Platform Overrides**: If GoogleTest auto-detection is incorrect, manually setting macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` in your compiler flags can resolve build or runtime issues.
