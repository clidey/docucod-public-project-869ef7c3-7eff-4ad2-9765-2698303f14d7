# Advanced Mocking Behaviors

This page dives into advanced mocking features in GoogleMock that empower you to handle intricate test scenarios and improve error visibility during mock-based testing. Here you will learn about specialized mock classes – `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` – advanced matcher utilities, sophisticated call ordering with sequences and `After` clauses, and extended error reporting that helps pinpoint issues faster.

---

## Specialized Mock Classes for Different Testing Styles

GoogleMock provides three important wrapper mock classes that customize the behavior of uninteresting calls — calls to mock methods without explicit expectations:

- **`NiceMock<T>`**: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, making tests less noisy when irrelevant methods are invoked.
- **`NaggyMock<T>`**: The default mock type, which prints warnings on uninteresting calls to alert you of unexpected invocations without failing the test.
- **`StrictMock<T>`**: Immediately fails the test on any uninteresting call, helping ensure that no unexpected calls sneak by unnoticed.

All three classes act as subclasses of the underlying mock class `T`. You construct them just like normal mocks, and can use them wherever a `T` object is required.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;      // No uninteresting call warnings.
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_foo;    // Default: warnings on uninteresting calls.
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;  // Fails on uninteresting calls.
```

### Tips:
- Use `NiceMock` when you want clean test output and don’t care about unrelated method calls.
- Use `NaggyMock` during development to catch unexpected calls early but not fail immediately.
- Use `StrictMock` for enforcing complete control over mock interactions, usually in critical tests.

## Default Actions and Expectation Ordering

### Setting Default Actions with `ON_CALL`

`ON_CALL` lets you specify a *default* behavior for a mock method, used when no matching `EXPECT_CALL` is triggered. This is useful for common fallback behavior.

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;

ON_CALL(foo, GetValue())
    .WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

Multiple `ON_CALL`s can be specified per mock method. The **last matching** `ON_CALL` takes precedence.

### Defining Expected Calls with `EXPECT_CALL`

Use `EXPECT_CALL` to define specific expectations — the mock method must be called accordingly or tests fail.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, DoThis(5))
    .Times(2)
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(true));
```

Expectations can be chained with clauses such as `.Times()`, `.WillOnce()`, `.WillRepeatedly()`, `.InSequence()`, `.After()`, `.With()` ,and `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to precisely control behavior and call order.

### Matching Priority & Stickiness

- Expectations are matched in reverse order (newer overrides older), so place more specific expectations last.
- By default, expectations remain *sticky*: even when saturated, they keep matching calls unless `.RetiresOnSaturation()` is used or another call follows in sequence.

---

## Controlling Call Order with Sequences and After Clauses

GoogleMock allows strict call ordering through:

### 1. `InSequence`

Creates a sequence ordering for all expectations within its scope.

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, FirstCall());
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, SecondCall());
}
```

Calls to these expectations will fail if they occur out of order.

### 2. `Sequence` and `.InSequence(sequences...)`

You can define multiple `Sequence` objects and associate expectations to any combination of them, enabling partial and complex orderings.

```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Reset()).InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(foo, GetValue()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(foo, SetValue()).InSequence(s2);
```

This means `Reset()` must be called before both `GetValue()` and `SetValue()`, but `GetValue()` and `SetValue()` can occur in any order.

### 3. `.After()` Clause

You can specify explicit dependency orderings using `.After()` on `Expectation` or `ExpectationSet` objects for fine-grained control.

```cpp
Expectation init_x = EXPECT_CALL(foo, InitX());
Expectation init_y = EXPECT_CALL(foo, InitY());
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Process()).After(init_x, init_y);
```

`Process()` will only be valid after both `InitX()` and `InitY()`.

---

## Managing Expectations Lifetimes

- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make an expectation inactive immediately after it’s fulfilled the expected number of times.
- This prevents unexpected calls from matching a saturated expectation, avoiding upper bound violations.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(7)).Times(2).RetiresOnSaturation();
```

After two calls matching `Bar(7)`, this expectation is retired, allowing other expectations to match subsequent calls.

---

## Handling Uninteresting, Unexpected, and Excessive Calls

| Call Type      | Behavior by Default                                          | Change Behavior With                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Uninteresting  | Warning message, default action returned                    | Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings, `StrictMock` to make failures.
| Unexpected     | Test failure, detailed failure messages are printed         | Cannot be modified without changing expectations.
| Excessive      | Warning (naggy), or failure if strict, default action used   | May tune expectations or use `.RetiresOnSaturation()`.

---

## Error Reporting and Verbosity Levels

GoogleMock provides a `--gmock_verbose` flag to control output verbosity:

- `info`: Print all informational messages, warnings, and errors, including full stack traces of calls.
- `warning`: Default level; print warnings and errors without stack traces for uninteresting calls.
- `error`: Print errors only, suppress warnings.

You can also control verbosity programmatically:

```cpp
::testing::FLAGS_gmock_verbose = "info";
```

Use `info` verbosity during debugging to get the most insight; switch to `warning` or `error` for cleaner test output in CI or production.

---

## Verifying and Clearing Mocks

You can explicitly verify and clear expectations on a mock:

- `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` verifies all expectations have been met and clears them.
- `Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock)` verifies and clears both expectations and default actions.

Call these to force verification before mock destruction if the mock lifetime is unclear, for example when mocks are heap-allocated and ownership is uncertain.

---

## Delegate Calls in Complex Scenarios

GoogleMock supports calling real or fake implementations from mocks, by delegating to real objects inside actions.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_foo, DoThis).WillByDefault([&real](Args...) {
  return real.DoThis(...);
});
```

This allows verifying interactions while preserving real behavior.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Place `EXPECT_CALL` before exercising code to prevent undefined behavior.
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` when defining multiple expectations on the same method to avoid sticky expectations that cause upper-bound violations.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` thoughtfully to balance noise and strictness in uninteresting call handling.
- When working with overloaded methods, use `Const()` wrapper and exact matcher types to disambiguate.
- Use `ON_CALL` to define default behavior without forcing expectations.

---

## Example: Enforcing Order and Handling Uninteresting Calls

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockDevice {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PowerOn, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Reset, ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetStatus, (), (const));
};

TEST(DeviceTest, StartupSequence) {
  MockDevice mock;

  {
    InSequence seq;

    EXPECT_CALL(mock, PowerOn());
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, Reset());
  }

  ON_CALL(mock, GetStatus()).WillByDefault(Return(0));

  // Only PowerOn and Reset are ordered expectations.
  mock.PowerOn();
  mock.Reset();
  EXPECT_EQ(0, mock.GetStatus()); // Uninteresting but defined
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Unexpected Call Failures

When a call doesn't match any expectation, you’ll get an error explaining which expectations were attempted and why they did not match (argument mismatches, unmet prerequisites, retired expectations).

Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get a complete trace of all calls and expectations to aid debugging.

### Excessive Calls

If a function is called more times than expected, consider:
- Adding `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire saturated expectations, or
- Adjusting `.Times()` cardinality.

### Uninteresting Call Warnings

If warnings on uninteresting mock calls appear:
- Confirm the calls should be allowed,
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings, or
- Add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());`.

### Default Actions Not Invoked

If a mock method has no default action and is called unexpectedly, GoogleMock forces a test failure. Define appropriate default actions with `ON_CALL` to avoid this.
