# Advanced Test Utilities

GoogleTest offers a variety of specialized utilities beyond core assertions and test structures. This page introduces powerful facilities such as death tests, exception handling support, logging capabilities, and fine-grained test control APIs. These advanced tools enable power users to write comprehensive, robust, and maintainable C++ tests that handle complex failure scenarios and improve diagnostic effectiveness.

---

## 1. Death Tests

Death tests allow you to verify that certain code snippets terminate your program as expected under fatal error conditions. This is essential for testing defensive checks, assertion failures, and other critical failure modes.

### Purpose and Use Cases
- Validate that a program terminates (e.g., via `exit()`, assertion failure) when presented with invalid input.
- Ensure safety checks and fatal error paths behave correctly.
- Confirm error messages or exit codes accompany termination.

### Key Concepts
- Executed in a subprocess to isolate abnormal termination.
- Macros such as `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)` and `ASSERT_DEATH(statement, regex)` run the statement and verify the process exit along with matching output.
- Death tests can verify output on stderr, contents of error messages, and signal termination.

### Usage Pattern
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(
    MyFunctionThatShouldCrash(),
    "Check failed: ptr != nullptr"
);
```
- The first argument is the statement expected to cause death.
- The second is a regex pattern matching the error output.

### Best Practices
- Keep death tests isolated; they spawn additional processes.
- Avoid side effects that cannot be serialized across subprocesses.
- Use death tests sparingly to cover truly fatal failure modes.

## 2. Exception Handling Support

While GoogleTest is designed for environments with or without exceptions, it provides facilities to test and diagnose exception-throwing code.

### Usage
- Assertions such as `EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`, and `EXPECT_NO_THROW` verify that code throws expected exceptions.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(MyFunction(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(MySafeFunction());
```

### Integration
- Death tests and exceptions can be combined to verify behavior in exceptional error conditions.

## 3. Advanced Logging and Diagnostic Features

GoogleTest supports scoped and fine-tuned logging within tests to aid debugging.

### Scoped Mock Logs
- `ScopedMockLog` helps intercept and verify logging output during tests.
- You can set expectations on log messages to ensure correct diagnostic output.

### Verbosity Control
- Use the `--gmock_verbose` flag to control verbosity of mock object diagnostics:
  - `info`: logs all mock calls, warnings, and stack traces.
  - `warning`: prints warnings without stack traces (default).
  - `error`: only errors are logged, suppressing warnings.

Example:
```bash
test_binary --gmock_verbose=info
```

### Tips
- Adjust verbosity to debug complex mock interactions.
- Suppress unhelpful warnings using `NiceMock` or by configuring expected calls properly.

## 4. Advanced Mock Behavior Control

Beyond basic mocking, GoogleMock provides strictness modes and expectation control to help manage uninteresting and unexpected mock calls.

### Mock Strictness Wrappers
- `NiceMock<T>`: suppresses warnings about uninteresting calls. Use to reduce noise when only some interactions matter.

- `NaggyMock<T>`: warns on uninteresting calls (default mock behavior).

- `StrictMock<T>`: treats uninteresting calls as test failures. Enforce strict behavioral verification.

### Construction
- These wrappers are subclasses of your mock class and inherit all constructors.

Example:
```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock_foo;
StrictMock<MockBar> strict_mock_bar("arg1", 5);
```

### Best Practices
- Use `NiceMock` for relaxed tests and rapid prototyping.
- Use `StrictMock` when you want to enforce complete behavior verification.
- Avoid mixing multiple strictness wrappers on the same mock.

### API highlights
- Check mock strictness status:
```cpp
bool is_nice = Mock::IsNice(&mock_obj);
bool is_strict = Mock::IsStrict(&mock_obj);
bool is_naggy = Mock::IsNaggy(&mock_obj);
```
- Control uninteresting calls via these wrappers without polluting expectations.

## 5. Controlling Mock Expectations and Sequences

GoogleMock enables detailed control over ordering and grouping of mock expectations.

### Sequences
- Define `Sequence` objects to impose chronological order on expected calls.
- `EXPECT_CALL(...).InSequence(s1, s2)` requires calls to happen in the combined sequence order.
- Internally manages partial ordering (DAG) of calls for complex interactions.

### Dependencies and Ordering
- Use `After(expectation)` clause to express that a mock call must occur after other expectations.
- Combine `InSequence` and `After` to specify partial orders and phases of complex behaviors.

Example:
```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, FirstCall()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SecondCall()).InSequence(s1, s2).After(first_call_expectation);
```

### Retiring Expectations
- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make an expectation retire (become inactive) after its call count is reached.
- Prevents conflicts from overlapping expectations on the same mock method matching calls repeatedly.

## 6. Forcing Explicit Verification and Managing Mock Lifetimes

GoogleMock automatically verifies expectations on mock destruction. However, you may need manual control.

### Manual Verification
- `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj)` forces verification immediately.
- Returns boolean indicating success.
- Do not set new expectations after verification.

### Verification with Action Clearing
- `Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock_obj)` also clears default actions.

### Allowing Mock Leaks
- `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj)` prevents leaked mocks from causing test failures.

## 7. Tips and Troubleshooting

### Common Pitfalls
- Setting expectations after mock method calls leads to undefined behavior.
- Missing virtual destructors cause memory leaks in tests.
- Unintentional expectation overlaps cause confusing failures; use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` where appropriate.
- Overly strict mocks (`StrictMock`) can cause brittle tests; balance verification needs.

### Debugging Aid
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to get detailed logging of mock calls and expectation matching.
- Use sequences and checkpoints to observe call order during complex tests.

### Best Practices
- Combine `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` for strict verbalized expectations.
- Use `NiceMock` in tests where only some methods are relevant, to suppress noise.
- Use `StrictMock` when you want to ensure no unexpected calls happen.

<AccordionGroup title="Advanced Test Utilities Reference">

<Accordion title="Death Tests">
Death tests execute code expected to cause fatal failures in a subprocess, verifying process termination and error output. Macros like `EXPECT_DEATH` and `ASSERT_DEATH` check that statements crash as intended and match error messages. They isolate fatal errors without crashing the test runner.

Example usage:
```cpp
EXPECT_DEATH(
   SomeFunctionThatExits(),
   "fatal error message regex"
);
```

Key considerations include subprocess overhead and avoiding side effects in death test code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Exception Handling Verification">
GoogleTest provides assertions to ensure code properly throws or does not throw exceptions. Use `EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`, and `EXPECT_NO_THROW` to check exception behavior precisely.

Example:
```cpp
EXPECT_THROW(FunctionUnderTest(), std::runtime_error);
EXPECT_NO_THROW(FunctionUnderTest());
```

This facility helps verify exception safety and error handling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mock Strictness Wrappers">
GoogleMock offers wrappers to modulate strictness of mocks regarding uninteresting calls:

- `NiceMock<T>`: suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls (default in future).
- `NaggyMock<T>`: warns on uninteresting calls (current default).
- `StrictMock<T>`: treats uninteresting calls as failures.

Use them by wrapping your mock class:
```cpp
NiceMock<MockClass> nice_mock;
StrictMock<MockClass> strict_mock;
```
They help manage test noise and enforce call constraints.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Expectation Ordering and Partial Ordering">
Control call sequences using `Sequence` objects and clauses:

- `.InSequence(seq1, seq2)`: places expectations in chronological order.
- `.After(expectation)`: requires an expectation to happen after one or more others.
- `.RetiresOnSaturation()`: retires expectations after max calls.

This helps model complex call dependencies and ensure call order correctness.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mock Verification and Lifecycle Control">
Mocks verify expectations on destruction but can be verified manually with:

- `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)` — verifies and clears expectations.
- `Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock)` — verifies and clears expectations and default actions.
- `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock)` — allows leaking a mock without failure.

Explicit verification is important when mock lifetime is managed externally.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Error Handling and Debugging">
For deeper insight into expectation failures and mock call behavior:

- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace all mock calls and matches.
- Use expected calls, sequences, and checkpoints to pinpoint issues.
- Adjust mock strictness to balance noise and error detection.

Employ provided debugging flags and logging to diagnose test failures rapidly.
</Accordion>

# Example: Using `NiceMock` to Reduce Noise

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::NiceMock;

class MockDatabase {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string&), ());
};

TEST(DatabaseTest, SimpleQuery) {
  NiceMock<MockDatabase> mock_db;

  ON_CALL(mock_db, Connect()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query("SELECT * FROM users"))
      .WillOnce(Return(42));

  // Code under test calls mock_db.Connect() and mock_db.Query(...)
  ASSERT_TRUE(mock_db.Connect());
  EXPECT_EQ(mock_db.Query("SELECT * FROM users"), 42);
}
```

Here, uninteresting calls to `Connect()` will not produce warnings.
