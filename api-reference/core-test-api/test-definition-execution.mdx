# Test Definition & Execution

## Overview

This page serves as a comprehensive reference guide to the core macros and interfaces that GoogleTest provides for defining, organizing, and executing unit tests. It highlights the fundamental constructs for declaring test cases, the mechanism for automatic test discovery, and how the main function integrates with the test runner to execute your test suites.

GoogleTest’s test definition and execution model enables developers to write fast, isolated, and expressive tests with minimal boilerplate, while offering flexibility to scale from simple unit tests to complex parameterized and typed tests.

---

## Key Concepts in Test Definition

### The TEST Macro

The `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro defines an individual test function within a test suite:

- **TestSuiteName**: Groups related tests together logically, mirroring the structure of the code under test.
- **TestName**: The unique identifier of a test within the suite.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

This creates a test named `HandlesZeroInput` in the `FactorialTest` suite. When this test runs, GoogleTest executes the test body and reports success or failure based on assertions.

### The TEST_F Macro (Test Fixtures)

`TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)` is used instead of `TEST` when multiple tests share a common setup or teardown through a test fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.

Test fixtures allow you to declare objects and setup/teardown logic once, then write multiple tests that run with that shared context.

Example:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

This ensures each test runs on its fresh instance of `QueueTest`, with initialization applied.

### Test Registration & Discovery

GoogleTest automatically registers all tests declared via `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros behind the scenes. You do not need to enumerate or manually register tests. 

At runtime, `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` invokes all registered tests, managing creation of fixtures, invocation of tests, and collection of results.

---

## Managing Test Execution

### Running Tests

The customary entry point to run tests is via the `main()` function, which calls:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- `InitGoogleTest()` processes GoogleTest-specific command-line flags.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` executes all registered tests and returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

Alternatively, linking your test binary with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` provides a default main() that does this automatically.

### Test Suites Lifecycle

Each test suite can define static methods:

- `SetUpTestSuite()` — Runs once before the first test in the suite.
- `TearDownTestSuite()` — Runs once after the last test in the suite.

These allow expensive resource setups shared across multiple tests in the suite.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports advanced test definitions that run the same test logic with varying input data or types.

- `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` enable value-parameterized tests.
- `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST` support typed test suites that run tests across multiple types.

Such tests enhance test coverage without duplication, fitting naturally into GoogleTest’s test execution model.

## Test Assertions

While this page focuses on test definition and execution, assertions (`EXPECT_*`, `ASSERT_*`) comprise the core of test validation inside test bodies. They verify conditions and determine test outcomes.

See the [Assertions Reference](../core-test-api/assertions-reference) for comprehensive coverage.

---

## Test Fixture Classes

### Defining a Fixture

Create a test fixture by subclassing `testing::Test`:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code run immediately before each test
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup after each test
  }
  // Declare members accessible to tests
  int shared_value_;
};
```

### Using Test Fixtures

Use `TEST_F(MyFixture, TestName)` to define tests which have access to fixture members and lifecycle.

Each test creates a separate fixture instance ensuring test isolation.

---

## Test Execution Flow

The typical flow of test execution in GoogleTest is:

1. GoogleTest initializes via `InitGoogleTest()`.
2. Test binaries register all tests declaratively.
3. `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` discovers registered tests and iterates over them.
4. For each test:
   - Fixture is constructed.
   - `SetUp()` is called.
   - Test body is executed.
   - `TearDown()` is called.
   - Fixture is destructed.
5. Results and summaries are reported.
6. Return code signals overall pass/fail.

This execution model supports concurrency, retries, filtering, and detailed reporting.

---

## Main Function Integration

Normally, you do not write your own `main()`. Instead, link with the `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` libraries that provide the main function.

If customization is needed, write your own main function as follows:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

`InitGoogleTest` parses command-line flags and sets up the framework.

`RUN_ALL_TESTS()` executes all registered test suites and tests and returns overall status.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Always call `InitGoogleTest` once before running tests.
- Do not ignore return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`; it indicates success or failure.
- Avoid defining tests with underscores in names to prevent macro issues.
- Use test fixtures to share expensive setup among related tests.
- Use parameterized tests to avoid repetitive similar tests.
- Tests are isolated: no shared mutable state between `TEST_F` instances.
- Use `EXPECT_*` for nonfatal assertions and `ASSERT_*` for fatal ones.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Test not executed:** Verify test is correctly defined and linked. Disabled tests won't run unless enabled via flag.
- **Link errors for main():** Ensure you link either `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` or provide your own `main()`.
- **Tests not discovered:** Check macros and namespaces; all tests must be declared at global or namespace scope.
- **Fatal failure on Init:** Verify command-line parameters and environment setup with `InitGoogleTest`.

## Example: Quick Test Program

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A simple function to test.
int Square(int x) {
  return x * x;
}

// Basic test case.
TEST(MathTest, SquareOfPositive) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Square(5), 25);
}

// Using a test fixture.
class MathTestFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    base_ = 3;
  }
  int base_;
};

TEST_F(MathTestFixture, SquareOfBase) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Square(base_), 9);
}

// main entry point for tests
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Compile and run this to see test discovery, execution, and reporting in action.
