# File and Path Utilities API Reference

This page details the API of utility classes and functions dedicated to managing file and directory paths in GoogleTest. These utilities provide platform-aware handling of filesystem paths, enabling consistent interaction with test output files such as XML reports, managing filesystem operations like directory creation, and ensuring safe, unique file naming. This is critical for reliable test output management across diverse operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

---

## Overview

### Purpose

GoogleTest's File and Path Utilities encapsulate common filesystem path operations such as joining paths, normalizing separators, removing directory or filename components, and managing file extensions. They also handle the creation and verification of directories and files, abstracting platform differences such as path separators and directory semantics.

### Platform Awareness

On Windows, the primary path separator is `\`, but GoogleTest also recognizes `/` as an alternate separator. On POSIX-compliant systems, `/` is the standard. The utilities normalize paths internally and handle these differences transparently.

The utilities ensure that file and directory paths are managed correctly regardless of platform while adhering to platform conventions, thus facilitating test output generation and file management tasks in a cross-platform manner.

## FilePath Class

The central class for path manipulation in GoogleTest is `FilePath`. It represents a file or directory path as a string and offers various methods for querying and modifying path components.

### Key Features

- **Construction and Representation:**
  - Constructed from strings or other `FilePath` objects.
  - Immutable behavior: all modification methods return new `FilePath` instances, supporting a value-type programming style.

- **Path Normalization:**
  - Normalizes multiple consecutive separators into a single platform-appropriate separator.
  - On Windows, converts alternate separators (`/`) to the primary separator (`\`).

- **Path Component Manipulation:**
  - `RemoveDirectoryName()` returns the filename component, stripping directories.
  - `RemoveFileName()` returns the directory component, stripping the filename.
  - `RemoveExtension(extension)` removes a case-insensitive extension if present.
  - `ConcatPaths(directory, relative_path)` joins two path components appropriately.

- **Filesystem Queries:**
  - `FileOrDirectoryExists()` returns true if the path exists as a file or directory.
  - `DirectoryExists()` returns true if the path is an existing directory.
  - `IsDirectory()` returns true if the path string ends with a path separator.
  - `IsAbsolutePath()` returns true if the path is absolute per platform rules.
  - `IsRootDirectory()` returns true if the path is a root directory such as `/` or `C:\`.

- **Directory Creation:**
  - `CreateFolder()` creates a single directory if it doesn't exist.
  - `CreateDirectoriesRecursively()` creates directories along the entire path if needed.

- **Unique Filename Generation:**
  - `GenerateUniqueFileName(directory, base_name, extension)` generates a file path that does not yet exist by appending incremental numbers.

### Important Constants

- `kPathSeparator` - The primary separator character (e.g., `\` on Windows, `/` on POSIX).
- `kAlternatePathSeparator` (Windows only) - Alternate valid separator `/`.

### Constructor Examples

```cpp
FilePath dir("my_dir/");
FilePath file("my_dir/my_file.xml");
FilePath from_string(std::string("my_dir/my_file.xml"));
```

### Common Use Cases

- **Joining a directory and filename:**

  ```cpp
  FilePath file = FilePath::ConcatPaths(FilePath("logs/"), FilePath("test_results.xml"));
  ```

- **Generating unique names:**

  ```cpp
  FilePath unique_file = FilePath::GenerateUniqueFileName(FilePath("output/"), FilePath("test"), "xml");
  ```

- **Checking if a path exists and is a directory:**

  ```cpp
  if (file_path.DirectoryExists()) {
    // Safe to write files inside
  }
  ```

- **Removing file extension:**

  ```cpp
  FilePath without_ext = file_path.RemoveExtension("xml");
  ```

### Method Details

#### GetCurrentDir()

Returns the current working directory as a `FilePath`. On some embedded platforms without current directory concepts, it provides a reasonable fallback.

#### RemoveDirectoryName()

Strips the directory part, returning just the filename portion. If the path has no directory, returns the path unchanged.

#### RemoveFileName()

Strips filename, returning only the directory portion. Returns `"./"` or platform equivalent if no directory present.

#### RemoveExtension(const char* extension)

Removes the case-insensitive extension (e.g., "EXE", "xml") if found, returning a path without the extension.

#### MakeFileName(const FilePath& directory, const FilePath& base_name, int number, const char* extension)

Builds a file name according to the pattern:

- `directory/base_name.extension` if number == 0
- `directory/base_name_<number>.extension` if number > 0

Uses platform-specific path separators.

#### ConcatPaths(const FilePath& directory, const FilePath& relative_path)

Joins directory and relative path adding a path separator if necessary. If directory is empty, returns the relative path.

#### GenerateUniqueFileName(const FilePath& directory, const FilePath& base_name, const char* extension)

Generates a filename that does not exist on the file system by trying incremental number suffixes until an unused file is found.

## Practical Usage

To reliably write XML test output files in a directory:

<Steps>
<Step title="Get or create the desired output directory">
Use `CreateDirectoriesRecursively()` to ensure the directory exists.

```cpp
FilePath output_dir("test_results/");
if (!output_dir.CreateDirectoriesRecursively()) {
  // Handle error: unable to create directory
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Generate a unique filename to avoid overwriting">

Use `GenerateUniqueFileName()` with base name and extension:

```cpp
FilePath unique_file = FilePath::GenerateUniqueFileName(output_dir, FilePath("results"), "xml");
```
</Step>
<Step title="Use the generated filename for output">
Write your test XML output to `unique_file.string()`.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Best Practices

- Always use `FilePath` utilities rather than raw string concatenation for paths to avoid platform-specific separator bugs.
- Normalize paths with `Normalize()` when manipulating constructed paths programmatically.
- Use `GenerateUniqueFileName()` to safely generate non-colliding output files in multi-process or multi-threaded test scenarios.
- Prefer `CreateDirectoriesRecursively()` when creating nested directories to avoid errors if parent directories do not exist.
- Check `DirectoryExists()` before writing to or reading from directory paths to reduce runtime errors.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Paths not recognized as directory:** Ensure directory paths end with a separator (e.g., `"dir/"` on POSIX) to indicate directory semantics.
- **Directory creation failure:** Check permissions or existing files blocking directory creation with `CreateDirectoriesRecursively()`.
- **Unique filename collisions:** Multiple concurrent processes can race in unique filename generation; if this occurs, consider external coordination.
- **Path separator inconsistencies:** Mixing slashes and backslashes is normalized internally; however, it's best to use `FilePath` methods to keep things consistent.

## Example Code Snippets

```cpp
// Join a directory and filename
FilePath output_dir("logs/");
FilePath filename("test_results.xml");
FilePath full_path = FilePath::ConcatPaths(output_dir, filename);
std::cout << "Full path: " << full_path.string() << std::endl;

// Remove extension
FilePath file_with_ext("bin/executable.exe");
FilePath without_ext = file_with_ext.RemoveExtension("exe");
std::cout << "Without extension: " << without_ext.string() << std::endl;

// Generate unique filename
FilePath unique_file = FilePath::GenerateUniqueFileName(output_dir, FilePath("test_output"), "xml");
std::cout << "Unique filename: " << unique_file.string() << std::endl;

// Create directories recursively
FilePath deep_dir("output/logs/runtime/");
if (deep_dir.CreateDirectoriesRecursively()) {
  std::cout << "Created directories " << deep_dir.string() << std::endl;
}
```

## Additional Notes

- The class is used internally by GoogleTest for storing test output files, especially for XML reports.
- On certain platforms like Windows Mobile and embedded devices, some filesystem capabilities may have limited behavior.
- These utilities assume that path syntax correctness (e.g., forbidden characters) is managed externally.
