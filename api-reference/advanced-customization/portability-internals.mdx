# Portability and Internal Utilities

API reference for low-level headers supporting platform portability, macro customization, and internal utility functions. Useful for integration, platform adaptation, or contributing to framework internals.

---

## Overview

This section of the API documents the core low-level internal utilities and headers enabling GoogleTest’s operation across diverse compilation environments and platforms. It exposes macros, utilities, and internal interfaces that support:

- Platform portability and adaptation
- Custom macro injection points
- Low-level synchronization primitives
- Internal utility functions such as string conversions, environment variable parsing, and thread handling

This information is essential for advanced users who need to integrate GoogleTest into custom platforms, adapt or extend its internals, or contribute to its core.


---

## Customization Macros

GoogleTest provides predefined macros in its internal headers allowing users or embedders to customize critical internal behaviors. These macros let you override default implementations or enable platform-specific functionality.

### Key Macros in `gtest.h` and `gtest-port.h`

| Macro                              | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_OS_STACK_TRACE_GETTER_`    | Specifies a custom implementation of the OS stack trace getter (`OsStackTraceGetterInterface`). |
| `GTEST_CUSTOM_TEMPDIR_FUNCTION_`  | Overrides the `testing::TempDir()` function to specify a custom temporary directory.            |
| `GTEST_LOG_(severity)`             | Macro to control logging with specified severity levels. Requires providing `LogToStderr()` and `FlushInfoLog()` functions too.
|
| `GTEST_CHECK_(condition)`          | Provides a check macro that aborts on failed condition with detailed logging.
|
| `GTEST_HAS_NOTIFICATION_`         | Enables notification feature if your platform already provides it.
|
| `GTEST_HAS_MUTEX_AND_THREAD_LOCAL_` | Enables mutex and thread-local storage support if already provided by your environment, must declare and define static mutex macros accordingly.
|
| `GTEST_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK_REQUIRED_(locks)` | Annotation macro to specify exclusive lock requirements.
|
| `GTEST_LOCK_EXCLUDED_(locks)`     | Annotation macro to specify locks excluded from a function.
|
| `GTEST_HAS_CXXABI_H_`             | Detects if `<cxxabi.h>` is present for certain implementations.
|
| `GTEST_API_`                      | Specifier macro controlling exported symbols visibility.

These macros enable flexible integration, letting users replace or augment GoogleTest internals for specific platform or project needs.

<Note>
These macros are intended for advanced customization and internal use only. Improper configuration may lead to undefined behavior or build issues.
</Note>

## Platform Portability and Synchronization Primitives

GoogleTest internally abstracts platform differences to provide consistent thread safety and synchronization features.

### Mutex and ThreadLocal

- **Mutex**: The synchronization primitive used across GoogleTest for locking. Its implementation varies by platform:
  - On Windows, based on `CRITICAL_SECTION`.
  - On POSIX systems, based on `pthread_mutex_t`.
  - If threading is not supported, dummy implementations that do nothing.

- **MutexLock**: RAII-style lock that acquires a mutex on construction and releases it on destruction.

- **ThreadLocal**: Thread-local storage abstraction supporting storing values per thread to maintain thread safety.

### Notification

- Provides a synchronization mechanism allowing a controller thread to notify one or more other threads to start execution.

### Thread Support

- Classes like `ThreadWithParam` are used internally for multi-threaded test execution. They wrap platform threading APIs (pthread or Windows threads) with a consistent interface.

<Warning>
Thread and synchronization primitives are internal utilities. GoogleTest users generally do not need to invoke them directly unless extending or embedding GoogleTest in unusual environments.
</Warning>

---

## Internal Utility Functions and Classes

GoogleTest defines numerous utility functions supporting its internal workings. Users interested in extending test infrastructure or debugging GoogleTest deeply will find these useful.

### Time Utilities

- `GetTimeInMillis()`: Retrieves the current time since epoch in milliseconds.
- `FormatTimeInMillisAsSeconds()`: Converts a millisecond time to a formatted second string.
- `FormatEpochTimeInMillisAsIso8601()`: Converts milliseconds since epoch to an ISO 8601 date string (non-thread safe).

### Environment Variable Utilities

- `Int32FromEnvOrDie()`: Reads an environment variable as 32-bit integer and aborts on failure.
- `ShouldShard()`, `ShouldRunTestOnShard()`: Utilities supporting test sharding by environment configuration.

### STL Container Utilities

- `CountIf()`: Counts elements matching a predicate.
- `ForEach()`: Applies a function to each container element.
- `GetElementOr()`: Returns element at index or a default value if out of range.
- `ShuffleRange()` and `Shuffle()`: Implements in-place Fisher-Yates shuffling of vectors.
- `Delete()`: Helper for deleting pointers in containers.

### String Conversion Utilities

- `CodePointToUtf8()`: Unicode code point to UTF-8 conversion.
- `WideStringToUtf8()`: Converts wide Unicode strings to UTF-8.

### Stack Trace and Debugging

- `OsStackTraceGetterInterface`: Abstract interface to retrieve OS-specific stack traces.
- `OsStackTraceGetter`: Default implementation.

### Test Property and Flag Management

- `TestPropertyKeyIs`: Predicate class for matching test property keys.
- `GTestFlagSaver`: Saves and restores flag states for GoogleTest flags.
- `UnitTestOptions`: Static methods for parsing and handling options related to output, filters, and exception processing.

<Info>
These utilities are generally used by GoogleTest internally. Advanced integrations or custom platforms may need to understand and potentially override or extend these.
</Info>

## Regular Expression (Regex) Support

GoogleTest supports multiple regex engines depending on platform availability:

- **RE2 (Abseil)**: Preferred if compiled with Abseil support.
- **POSIX Extended Regex**: Used on most UNIX-like platforms.
- **Simple Regex**: Fallback regex implementation where others are unavailable.

Regex support is encapsulated in the `RE` class, providing `FullMatch` and `PartialMatch` static methods for matching strings against regexes.

<Note>
Understanding and using GoogleTest’s regex can help in customizing test filters and matching test names programmatically.
</Note>

---

## Logging and Checks

GoogleTest defines internal logging utilities that are configurable via macros:

- **GTEST_LOG_()**: Macro to log messages at various severity levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`).
- **GTEST_CHECK_()**: Macro behaving as an all-mode assert that aborts the program if the given condition is false, printing diagnostic info. It can be used like assertions with streaming messages.

These logging macros provide consistent diagnostic outputs and are used internally within GoogleTest.

---

## File and Environment Handling

GoogleTest’s portability layer includes file system access and environment variable utilities:

- File handling wrappers provide cross-platform functions such as `FOpen()`, `FReopen()`, `FDOpen()`, `FClose()`.
- Environment access via `GetEnv()` abstracts platform differences, with special handling for embedded systems lacking environment variables.

---

## Source Code Location Formatting

Functions `FormatFileLocation()` and `FormatCompilerIndependentFileLocation()` produce file and line location strings in human- and machine-friendly formats, respectively. These are useful for test failure reporting and XML output.

---

## Thread Count Utility

`GetThreadCount()` attempts to return the current number of threads running in the process, if detectable. Returns zero if unable to detect. Useful internally for managing concurrency-related features.

## Header and Macro Summary

| Header            | Contents and Purpose                                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gtest-port.h`    | Low-level portability macros, synchronization primitives, regex abstraction, logging, I/O redirection utilities, threading support, environment variable helpers, platform detection macros.
| `gtest-printers.h`| Facilities for custom printer definitions enhancing GoogleTest output.
| `gtest-internal-inl.h` | Internal implementation details, classes, utilities used by GoogleTest core, including random seeding, test suite management, STM utilities, stack trace getters.
| Customization Headers (e.g., `gtest/internal/custom/`) | Injection points for defining overrides for macros, platform or user specific adaptions.

<Note>
Users extending GoogleTest core or embedding it deeply should familiarize themselves with these headers to customize GoogleTest internals appropriately.
</Note>

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Customization**: Use macros defined in customization points only if you intend to override default internal behaviors.
- **Thread Safety**: GoogleTest provides internal synchronization primitives to ensure thread safety where supported; avoid replacing these unless you have a platform-specific requirement.
- **Regex Usage**: Always validate regex patterns using provided facilities to avoid runtime failures.
- **Logging and Checks**: Use `GTEST_CHECK_()` for critical assertions within internal code to ensure failures are caught immediately.
- **Platform Adaptation**: Use provided abstractions for file and environment access to maintain cross-platform compatibility.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures on Portability Layer**: Ensure correct macros are defined to reflect platform capabilities (e.g., threading support, mutex availability).
- **Stack Trace Issues**: If custom stack trace retrieval is needed, provide a `GTEST_OS_STACK_TRACE_GETTER_` implementation.
- **Synchronization Primitives Missing**: For custom platforms lacking mutex or thread-local storage support, implement or disable them judiciously.
- **Regex Problems**: Use `ValidateRegex()` before regex use to prevent errors due to unsupported syntax or platform limitations.

## Example: Defining a Custom Temporary Directory Function

If your platform needs a special temporary directory, define the macro `GTEST_CUSTOM_TEMPDIR_FUNCTION_` to your custom function. For example:

```cpp
#define GTEST_CUSTOM_TEMPDIR_FUNCTION_ CustomTempDir

const char* CustomTempDir() {
  // Return path to your platform-specific temp directory.
  return "/my/custom/tempdir";
}
```

This overrides the default `testing::TempDir()` implementation.
