# Advanced/Internal Utilities

This page provides a detailed reference for advanced users, contributors, and framework integrators interested in GoogleMock's internal utilities. These utilities include meta-programming helpers, type traits, and failure reporting mechanisms that underlie the GoogleMock framework itself. They are not intended for direct use in typical user code but may be valuable for extending or debugging the framework.

---

## Purpose and Scope

While most users of GoogleMock interact through public APIs such as mocking macros and matchers, complex extensions or framework development require a deeper understanding of the internal helpers. This page documents key internal components that:

- Facilitate type trait checks and conversions for matchers and actions.
- Provide mechanisms to report test failures consistently.
- Offer utilities for internal string formatting and identifier parsing.
- Contain templates to adapt native arrays and container views for matchers.

> <Note> These internal utilities are *subject to change* and *not supported* for direct usage in user test code. Use with caution and always prefer public APIs when possible. </Note>

## Internal Utilities Overview

### Type Traits and Safe Casting

GoogleMock uses specialized templates to categorize C++ arithmetic types into `bool`, `integer`, `floating point`, and `other`. This classification supports safe casting between matcher argument types, ensuring that conversions are lossless (e.g., no silent truncation).

- `KindOf<T>`: Determines the kind of type `T`.
- `LosslessArithmeticConvertibleImpl`: A template struct that evaluates if one arithmetic type can be losslessly converted into another.
- `LosslessArithmeticConvertible`: Checks lossless convertibility for unmodified arithmetic types.

This machinery backs the `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` function users of GoogleMock interact with, enforcing strict type safety while allowing some implicit safe conversions.

### Failure Reporting

The `FailureReporterInterface` abstract class defines the interface for reporting test failures within the framework. It supports classifications for nonfatal and fatal failures, with implementations forwarding these messages into Google Test's assertion system.

- `GetFailureReporter()`: Returns the global reporter instance.
- `Assert(...)` and `Expect(...)`: Low-level internal functions to assert and expect conditions, reporting failures with detailed source location and message.

This ensures that GoogleMock integrates cleanly with Google Test's reporting, showing errors and warnings consistently.

### Logging

Internal logging utilities provide controlled verbose output depending on the `--gmock_verbose` flag, allowing users and framework developers to see informational messages, warnings, or errors.

- `LogIsVisible(LogSeverity severity)`: Checks if a certain log level should be emitted.
- `Log(LogSeverity severity, const std::string& message, int frames_to_skip)`: Outputs the log with optional stack trace support.

### String and Identifier Utilities

Utilities for internal string manipulation include:

- `JoinAsKeyValueTuple()`: Joins vectors of key strings and their matched values into a tuple-style string for matchers describing multiple arguments.
- `ConvertIdentifierNameToWords()`: Transforms a C++ identifier (including camel case or underscore styles) into a space-separated, lowercase phrase, aiding in automatic matcher description generation.

### Pointer Helpers

A set of templated `GetRawPointer()` overloads safely extract raw pointers from raw pointers, smart pointers (supporting `.get()`), and reference wrappers, enabling uniform handling in matchers and actions.

### STL Container Adaptors

To work uniformly with diverse container types and native arrays, GoogleMock provides `StlContainerView<RawContainer>`:

- For native arrays, this wraps them into a lightweight container-like object with iterators.
- For STL-style containers, `StlContainerView` is an identity.

This abstraction enables generic matchers to handle both native arrays and STL containers transparently.

### Tuple and FlatTuple Utilities

GoogleMock implements an internal, specialized `FlatTuple` type, designed to limit template instantiations and reduce compile times compared to `std::tuple`, while maintaining tuple functionality for argument matching and matcher implementation.

Some helper templates like `ElemFromList` and `FlatTupleElemBase` support tuple element type extraction and management.

### Base64 Decoding

Utilities to decode base64-encoded strings are present for use in certain matchers (`WhenBase64UnescapedMatcher`), aiding in validating encoded data passed as matcher parameters.

### Error Handling and Assertions

Internal assert functions like `Assert()`, `Expect()`, and `IllegalDoDefault()` help catch illegal usage patterns inside composite actions.

- `IllegalDoDefault()` reports errors when users try to use `DoDefault()` inside unsupported action compositions.

## Practical Examples and Patterns

This section offers insights and illustrative examples from internal utilities' perspective, not recommended for normal user code but helpful for advanced users.

### SafeMatcherCast Implementation Example

Under the hood, `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` uses the kind detection and lossless convertible templates to validate argument types, providing compile-time safety for matcher casts.

```cpp
template <typename From, typename To>
using LosslessArithmeticConvertible = ...; // As defined

// Usage:
Matcher<int> matcher_for_int = ...;
Matcher<long> matcher_for_long = SafeMatcherCast<long>(matcher_for_int);
```

### Using Internal Logging

Within GoogleMock internals, verbose logging is emitted based on severity and flags:

```cpp
if (LogIsVisible(kWarning)) {
  Log(kWarning, "Uninteresting mock call detected", 2);
}
```

### Converting Identifier Names for Descriptions

This utility generates readable matcher descriptions:

```cpp
std::string matcher_desc = ConvertIdentifierNameToWords("IsDivisibleBy7");
// matcher_desc == "is divisible by 7"
```

This helps generate user-friendly messages automatically from matcher names.

## Troubleshooting and Developer Tips

- Since internal utilities are prone to change, avoid using them directly in your test code.
- When debugging GoogleMock itself, understanding this layer helps trace failures caused by conversion errors or logging issues.
- Custom matchers and actions may rely on these utilities indirectly.
- Be cautious modifying or extending these helpers without thorough testing.

## For Contributors and Framework Integrators

If you plan on extending GoogleMock or contributing to its core, refer to these utils carefully:

- Implement new matcher or action templates with awareness of type traits here.
- Use `FailureReporterInterface` to report failures in your extension consistently.
- Employ string utilities to support good error message generation.
- Leverage container views and tuple utilities to support generic code with minimal template bloat.

  <Tip>
    Internal utilities are core to GoogleMock's robust operation; understanding them can aid in debugging, extending, or integrating with the framework but should never be used in typical tests.
  </Tip>
  <Note>
    Direct use of these utilities in user test code can cause fragile tests and is unsupported.
