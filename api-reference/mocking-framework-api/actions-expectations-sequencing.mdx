# Actions, Expectations, and Sequencing

This documentation details the core mechanisms of **GoogleMock** for defining mock behaviors and specifying call expectations using the `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL` macros. It covers cardinalities, sequences, repeated calls, action composition, and the precise framework that lets you simulate diverse behaviors and verify interactions in your tests.

---

## Overview

GoogleMock’s power lies in its ability to precisely specify *how* mocked methods are expected to behave and in what manner they are to be called. The two fundamental macros for this purpose are:

- **`ON_CALL()`**: Defines the default action when a mock method is called with matching arguments. This sets behavior but does *not* impose expectations on call occurrence.
- **`EXPECT_CALL()`**: Establishes expectations on mock method invocations, combining argument matchers, cardinalities, sequencing, and actions.

Choosing between these two wisely is key to robust tests: use `ON_CALL` to define behavior when call occurrence is not critical to verify, and `EXPECT_CALL` to enforce that calls are indeed made as expected.

---

## `EXPECT_CALL` Syntax and Behavior

The `EXPECT_CALL` macro sets up an expectation on a mock method, specifying *what* calls are valid and *what* they should do. The general form is:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(arg_matchers...))
    .With(multi_arg_matcher)    // optional
    .Times(cardinality)         // optional
    .InSequence(sequences...)   // optional
    .After(expectations...)     // optional
    .WillOnce(action)           // zero or more
    .WillRepeatedly(action)     // at most one
    .RetiresOnSaturation();     // optional
```

Each clause modifies the expectation and must be used in the order shown above. Here's what each clause does:

- `.With(matcher)`: Applies constraints on the entire tuple of arguments.
- `.Times(cardinality)`: Specifies how many times the call is expected.
- `.InSequence(sequences...)`: Enforces calls to appear in the specified sequence(s).
- `.After(expectations...)`: Calls this expectation only after all the listed expectations are satisfied.
- `.WillOnce(action)`: Defines behavior for calls, consumed one at a time.
- `.WillRepeatedly(action)`: Defines behavior after all `.WillOnce()` actions are used; only one allowed.
- `.RetiresOnSaturation()`: Marks the expectation to become inactive after hitting its upper invocation limit.

### Example

```cpp
using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::InSequence;

MockTurtle turtle;
{
  InSequence s;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(1);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100))
      .Times(AtLeast(1))
      .WillRepeatedly(Return());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp())
      .Times(1);
}

// Code using turtle...
```

This specifies an ordered sequence of expected calls:
- `PenDown()` called once.
- `Forward(100)` called at least once.
- `PenUp()` called once.

---

## Argument Matchers and the `.With()` Clause

Argument matchers specify what arguments are allowed or expected in a method call. When calls to the mock method are made, GoogleMock searches for the **last** matching expectation that is still active.

- Use `_` to match any argument.
- Use built-in matchers like `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `Ne()`, or compose them.
- The `.With()` clause allows you to specify a matcher on the whole argument tuple rather than individual arguments.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(my_mock, SetPosition(_, _))
    .With(Lt());  // Expects first arg < second arg
```

---

## Cardinalities (`.Times()` Clause)

Cardinalities specify how many times a mock method is expected to be called. GoogleMock supports these cardinalities:

| Cardinality          | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `AnyNumber()`        | Any number of times (including zero).
| `AtLeast(n)`         | At least `n` times.
| `AtMost(n)`          | At most `n` times.
| `Between(m, n)`      | Between `m` and `n` times, inclusive.
| `Exactly(n)` or `n`  | Exactly `n` times.

If `.Times()` is omitted, GoogleMock infers it per the `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` clauses.

Practice:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo())
    .Times(2);

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(_))
    .Times(AtLeast(1));
```

---

## Ordering Calls: `.InSequence()` and `InSequence` Scope

By default, expectations are unordered and calls can happen in any order. To require call order:

- Attach expectations to one or more `Sequence` objects via `.InSequence(sequence1, sequence2, ...)`.
- Use the RAII helper `InSequence` that pushes all expectations declared within its scope into an anonymous sequence, guaranteeing sequential calls.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::Sequence;
using ::testing::InSequence;

Sequence s1, s2;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Reset())
    .InSequence(s1, s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1())
    .InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2())
    .InSequence(s2);

// Or using InSequence scoped object
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Open());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Write());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Close());
}
```

Calls to these methods must occur in the order specified or tests fail.

---

## Specifying Partial Order: `.After()` Clause

Sometimes you need to specify partial order constraints rather than strict sequences. The `.After()` clause allows specifying that an expectation must occur only after other expectations have been satisfied.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::Expectation;

Expectation init_a = EXPECT_CALL(mock, InitA());
Expectation init_b = EXPECT_CALL(mock, InitB());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Start())
    .After(init_a, init_b);
```

This states that `Start()` should only be called after `InitA()` and `InitB()`.

The `.After()` clause can accept up to five `Expectation` or `ExpectationSet` arguments.

---

## Actions and Compositions

Actions specify what a mock method does when invoked. They include:

- Simple returns (`Return(value)`), returns references (`ReturnRef`), references to values (`ReturnPointee`), or throwing exceptions.
- Side effects like `SetArgPointee<N>(value)` to modify output arguments.
- Invoking functions, lambdas, or callbacks (`Invoke`, `InvokeWithoutArgs`, `InvokeArgument<N>`).
- Composite actions like `DoAll(action1, action2, ...)`, executing a set of actions sequentially, returning the last action's result.
- Ignoring return values with `IgnoreResult(action)`.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Compute(_, _))
    .WillOnce(DoAll(SetArgPointee<1>(42), Return(true)));
```

This sets the second argument (index 1) to 42 and returns `true`.

### Built-in actions and chaining

Multiple `.WillOnce()` calls chain, executing actions in order for successive calls.

E.g.,

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, GetValue())
    .WillOnce(Return(10))
    .WillOnce(Return(20))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(30));
```

Call 1: returns 10, Call 2: returns 20, subsequent calls: 30.

---

## Retiring Expectations (`.RetiresOnSaturation()`)

Expectations remain active while unsatisfied or even saturated (fully used) by default. This can cause errors on calls exceeding expected counts if not accounted for.

Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to make an expectation *retire* after it reaches its upper call bound, allowing subsequent matching expectations (typically more general ones) to handle calls.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(7))
    .Times(2)
    .RetiresOnSaturation();
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Process(_))
    .Times(AnyNumber());
```

The first two calls with argument 7 are matched by the first expectation, which retires after saturation; subsequent calls to `Process(7)` then match the more general expectation.

---

## Understanding Expectation Matching

- GoogleMock searches matching expectations in reverse order declared (newer rules override older ones).
- An expectation handles a call if it is *active*, *matches the arguments*, and *all its pre-requisites are satisfied*.
- Calls not matching any expectation are *unexpected* and cause test failure.
- Calls to mock functions without any matching `EXPECT_CALL` are *uninteresting* and allowed (may trigger warnings unless suppressed).

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- **Set expectations before exercising mock:** `EXPECT_CALL` must precede calls to the mock function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Use `.RetiresOnSaturation`** where appropriate to avoid unintended call saturation errors.
- **Order `EXPECT_CALL`s carefully:** More specific expectations should be declared *after* less specific ones.
- **Use sequences and `.After` for call ordering:** Avoid ad hoc timing assumptions.
- **Suppress uninteresting call warnings:** Use `NiceMock` or add catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())` if calls are expected but not interesting.

---

## Illustrative Code Example

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::_;  // Wildcard matcher
using ::testing::InSequence;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockTurtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), ());
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), ());
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLinesInOrder) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  {
    InSequence s;  // All expectations in this scope must happen in order.

    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100)).Times(AtLeast(1));
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
  }

  // Exercise code that uses 'turtle'...
  turtle.PenDown();
  turtle.Forward(100);
  turtle.Forward(100);
  turtle.PenUp();
}
```

If calls are made out of order or missing, GoogleMock will immediately report failures with file/line location and clear trace.

---

## Additional Features

- **Multiple `.WillOnce()` clauses**: Specify a sequence of different actions for successive calls.
- **`.WillRepeatedly()`**: Specifies the default action after exhaust of `.WillOnce()` actions.
- **`ON_CALL()`**: Set default behavior without imposing call count constraints.
- **Composing actions via `DoAll()`**, letting multiple effects occur per call.
- **Using lambdas and `Invoke()`** to seamlessly delegate mock method behavior.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Unexpected calls**: Occur when calls don’t match any `EXPECT_CALL`. Either adjust expectations or verify arguments.
- **Too many calls**: If a method is called more than allowed, you’ll get failure; consider `.RetiresOnSaturation()` or increase `.Times()` bounds.
- **Uninteresting call warnings**: Indicate calls with no expectation; suppress via `NiceMock` or catch-all `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- **Sticky expectations**: Be aware that expectations remain active after saturation by default unless `.RetiresOnSaturation()` is used.
- **Order of expectations matters**: Newer expectations override older ones; place more specific expectations after default ones.
