# Test Lifecycle and Main Entry Point

## Overview

This page provides a detailed understanding of how to initialize test executables, manage the lifecycle of your GoogleTest and GoogleMock tests, and leverage the built-in main entry point provided by `gmock_main`. It empowers you to programmatically launch and orchestrate test suites with best practices to ensure smooth and predictable test execution.

Understanding the lifecycle and entry point integration is crucial for creating effective testing workflows, especially when your projects require custom setup or integration with other systems.

## Initializing the Test Executable

Every GoogleTest or GoogleMock executable requires proper initialization to parse command-line flags, set up the test environment, and prepare your test suites for execution. This process primarily involves invoking initialization functions that also parse and consume relevant command-line arguments.

### How to Initialize

Use the `testing::InitGoogleMock` function to initialize both GoogleMock and GoogleTest. This method: 

- Parses GoogleMock-specific flags (e.g., `--gmock_verbose`, `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks`).
- Calls `InitGoogleTest` internally to parse GoogleTest flags.
- Removes recognized flags from `argc` and `argv` to avoid erroneous flag parsing later.

#### Function Variants

You can choose the appropriate overload based on your application's environment:

```cpp
// Typical usage in standard C++ applications
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}

// Windows UNICODE mode
int main(int argc, wchar_t** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}

// Embedded or Arduino-like platforms (no argc/argv)
testing::InitGoogleMock();
```

### Why Use `InitGoogleMock`?

Although GoogleTest provides `InitGoogleTest()`, in GoogleMock you must use `InitGoogleMock()` instead. This is because GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest, and this ensures both frameworks are initialized correctly.

<Check>
Always initialize GoogleMock before running tests to ensure flag parsing and environment setup are done correctly. Failure to do this can result in unrecognized flags, skipped initializations, or unpredictable test behavior.
</Check>

## Running the Tests

After initialization, the typical way to run tests is by calling the macro `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. This macro:

- Runs every registered test suite and test case.
- Returns `0` if all tests pass; otherwise returns non-zero.
- Automatically handles test fixture creation and teardown.

### Basic Run Loop

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This is the standard pattern recommended for most users, offering immediate and reliable test execution.

## Using the Provided Main Entry Point

GoogleMock offers a convenience library `gmock_main` which provides a default `main()` implementation so you don't have to write your own. The `gmock_main`:

- Calls `testing::InitGoogleMock` with the received argc/argv.
- Prints a startup message.
- Invokes `RUN_ALL_TESTS` to execute tests.
- Returns the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS`.

### Linking with `gmock_main`

When building your test executable, link against `gmock_main` instead of `gmock`. This automatically provides a well-formed, fully functional main function.

```bash
# Example with CMake
add_executable(my_tests my_tests.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gmock_main)
```

This removes the need to maintain custom main boilerplate, simplifying test executables.

---

## Test Lifecycle Management

Effectively managing the lifecycle of tests involves understanding the phases your test executable goes through:

1. **Initialization:** Parsing flags and setting test environment.
2. **Test Registration:** GoogleTest macros automatically register test cases.
3. **Test Execution:** Running tests via `RUN_ALL_TESTS`.
4. **Verification:** Automatic verification of mock expectations upon mock object destruction.
5. **Teardown and Cleanup:** Frees resources and prints summary.

By using the standard initialization and run functions, GoogleTest and GoogleMock handle lifecycle details transparently.

<Info>
If you require complex lifecycle steps (e.g., setting global resources or custom logging), implement them in the test fixture or global test environment hooks such as `::testing::Environment`.
</Info>

## Best Practices for Launching and Managing Test Suites

### 1. Use the Recommended Initialization and Run Pattern

Always begin with `testing::InitGoogleMock` followed by `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. This ensures uniform behavior and flag handling.

### 2. Link with `gmock_main` Where Possible

If you don’t need to customize the main function, use the `gmock_main` target instead of writing your own main. This saves boilerplate and leverages a tested entry point.

### 3. Parse Command-Line Flags Correctly

Avoid manual parsing of input arguments that GoogleTest or GoogleMock expect. Provide flags according to documented tests flags syntax.

### 4. Handle Embedded and Special Platforms

On embedded or Arduino-like systems where `argc/argv` is unavailable:

- Use `testing::InitGoogleMock()` without parameters.
- Implement loop functions per platform requirements (e.g., Arduino's `setup()`/`loop()`).

### 5. Avoid Multiple Runs of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

Calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` more than once in an executable can cause conflicts, undefined behavior, or incorrect test results.

### 6. Use Test Fixtures and Global Environments for Setup

Manage shared resources and states using `Test Fixtures` (`TEST_F`), and for global setup or teardown, create classes derived from `::testing::Environment` and register them with `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()`.

## Example: Custom `main` Using GoogleMock Initialization

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Initialize GoogleMock and GoogleTest
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);

  // Run all tests and return the result
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## Example: Using `gmock_main`

Link your test source file with `gmock_main` and avoid writing your own `main`:

```bash
# In your CMakeLists.txt
add_executable(my_test test_file.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_test gmock_main)
```

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<Warning>
- Forgetting to call `InitGoogleMock` causes flags to be unrecognized and tests to not run correctly.
- Calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS` multiple times in one executable leads to unstable test results.
- Defining your own `main` and linking `gmock_main` simultaneously causes link errors due to multiple main definitions.
- Not linking against `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` and not defining `main` results in linker errors.
- On embedded platforms, failing to define proper entry points like `setup()`/`loop()` prevents tests from running.
</Warning>

<Tip>
For consistent behavior across platforms and integration environments, always prefer linking with the provided main entry points unless you have compelling reasons to customize.
