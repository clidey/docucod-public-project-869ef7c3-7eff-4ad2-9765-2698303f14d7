# Test Execution and Discovery

## Overview

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive infrastructure to discover, filter, and run tests, facilitating scalable and automated test execution. Whether you have a few tests or a massive suite, GoogleTest helps you manage your tests efficiently through simple command-line options and programmatic APIs.

This document covers how to invoke tests, control which tests run, configure execution behaviors, and integrate GoogleTest with continuous integration and test runners.

---

## Running Tests

### Basic Invocation

Typically, after compiling tests linked with GoogleTest, you get an executable. Running this executable will discover and run all registered tests:

```bash
./your_test_binary
```

This runs all tests and outputs a detailed report of test results.

### Programmatic Entry Point

GoogleTest requires initialization before running tests, which processes command-line flags. Your `main()` function should initialize GoogleTest (and any other GoogleTest-based framework like GoogleMock) before running all tests:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);  // Parses flags
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();                 // Runs all tests and returns the result
}
```

Note: If you link with `gtest_main` or `gmock_main`, a suitable `main()` is provided, and you don’t need to write your own.

### Return Codes

- Returns `0` if all tests pass.
- Returns a non-zero value if any test fails.

Always respect the return value to enable automation and CI pipelines to detect failures.

---

## Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically registers all tests defined in the program at static initialization time. You don't manually list or call tests; GoogleTest runs whatever tests it finds.

This mechanism supports great scalability, fostering quick test additions and refactoring without changing test run commands.

---

## Filtering Tests

When you have many tests, it's often necessary to run only a subset. GoogleTest provides powerful test filtering via the `--gtest_filter=` flag.

### Filter Syntax

```
--gtest_filter=POSITIVE_PATTERNS[-NEGATIVE_PATTERNS]
```

- `POSITIVE_PATTERNS` and optional `NEGATIVE_PATTERNS` are colon-separated patterns.
- Patterns are glob-like supports, with `*` matching anything, `?` matching one character.

### Examples

- Run all tests:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary
  # or equivalently
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=*
  ```

- Run tests in the `FooTest` test suite only:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=FooTest.*
  ```

- Run specific tests named `Bar` under any test suite:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=*.Bar
  ```

- Run all but exclude any tests with `Slow` in their names:

  ```bash
  ./your_test_binary --gtest_filter=* -Slow*
  ```

### Filtering with Multiple Patterns

You can specify multiple positive or negative patterns separated by colons `:`. For example:

```
--gtest_filter=FooTest.Test1:FooTest.Test2-BarTest.*
```

Runs only `FooTest.Test1` and `FooTest.Test2`, but excludes all tests in `BarTest`.

### Tips

- **Use full test suite and test names** for precise filtering.
- **Avoid over-filtering** that excludes needed tests accidentally.
- If many tests are filtered accidentally, use verbose output to troubleshoot.

---

## Test Listing

To print a list of all discovered tests without running them, use:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```

This outputs something like:

```
FooTest.
  TestCase1
  TestCase2
BarTest.
  TestAlpha
  TestBeta
```

This helps identify valid test suite and test names for filtering.

---

## Controlling Test Execution

### Shuffling Tests

To improve test robustness against order dependencies, GoogleTest can shuffle test execution order using:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_shuffle
```

The order is randomized but reproducible using a seed:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_shuffle --gtest_random_seed=12345
```

Use this feature to detect hidden dependencies when tests depend on side-effects or shared states.

### Running Tests in Repeat Mode

To stress test, run the entire suite multiple times:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_repeat=10
```

This runs all tests 10 times consecutively.

### Test Timeout

GoogleTest does **not** provide built-in test timeouts. You must use external tools or your test framework to enforce maximum test execution time.

### Test Output Formats

By default, GoogleTest prints to stdout in a human-readable form. Optionally, output can be generated in XML for CI integration:

```bash
./your_test_binary --gtest_output=xml[/path/to/file.xml]
```

If no file specified, defaults to `test_detail.xml` in the working directory.

---

## Test Environment Setup

GoogleTest supports command-line flags to configure behavior globally.

### Common Options

| Flag                       | Description                                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter`           | Filter which tests to run (see Filtering above). |
| `--gtest_list_tests`       | List all tests without running.                 |
| `--gtest_shuffle`          | Shuffle the order tests run.                     |
| `--gtest_random_seed`      | Seed used for shuffling.                         |
| `--gtest_repeat`           | Number of times to repeat all tests.            |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure` | Break into debugger on failure.                  |
| `--gtest_output`           | Output format (e.g., xml, json).                 |

## Integrating with Test Runners and CI

GoogleTest is designed to integrate seamlessly with continuous integration systems and test automation.

### Exit Codes

CI systems should rely on the exit code of test executables, which reflect test pass/fail status.

### XML Output

Generate JUnit-compatible XML via `--gtest_output=xml:` for most CI tools to consume.

### Parallel Test Frameworks

Use external tools like `gtest-parallel` or build system support (Bazel, CMake) to run tests concurrently for speedup.

### Test Filtering for CI

Run subsets of tests pertinent to the changed code using `--gtest_filter` to speed runs in pre-submit or nightly pipelines.

---

## Troubleshooting Test Execution

### Tests Not Running

- Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()` after `InitGoogleTest()`.
- Verify that tests build and link correctly.

### Tests Are Not Discovered

- Make sure tests are defined using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
- Avoid dead stripping of test objects by your linker.

### Filtering Does Not Match

- Run `--gtest_list_tests` to verify exact test names.
- Avoid wildcards or partial matches that exclude desired tests.

### Shuffled Order Breaks Tests

- This may indicate tests share global state or dependencies.
- Make tests independent or disable shuffle for debugging.

### Slow Tests

- Use `--gtest_filter` for smaller subsets.
- Consider parallel execution tools.
