# Test Creation and Structure

Comprehensive reference on defining and organizing test cases and test suites with GoogleTest. This documentation explains the test macros available, the automatic test discovery process, and recommended patterns for arranging tests to promote clarity, maintainability, and effective test design.

## 1. Introduction to Test Creation

GoogleTest enables you to define unit tests through a set of intuitive macros that simplify test declaration and organization. Understanding these macros and the underlying test discovery mechanisms is the first step to leveraging GoogleTest for scalable and readable test suites.

### Why Organize Your Tests Thoughtfully?

Organizing tests into meaningful suites and cases helps:

- Isolate related tests for better readability and reporting.
- Reuse setup and teardown logic with fixtures.
- Control test execution granularity.
- Improve maintainability as your test base grows.


## 2. Test Macros

GoogleTest provides several core macros for test definition and structure.

### `TEST(test_suite_name, test_name)`

Defines a single test function. It belongs to the group `test_suite_name` and is uniquely identified by `test_name` within that group.

**Usage:**
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, HandlesZero) {
  EXPECT_EQ(0, Factorial(0));
}
```

Each `TEST` macro instantiates a new test case function, with an independent lifetime and environment.

### `TEST_F(test_fixture, test_name)`

Defines a test that uses a test fixture class `test_fixture`. This class allows sharing setup/teardown code and variables among multiple tests.

**Example:**
```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
   void SetUp() override {
     // Initialization code
   }

   void TearDown() override {
     // Cleanup code
   }

   int shared_resource;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, Test1) {
  shared_resource = 5;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_resource, 5);
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, Test2) {
  EXPECT_NE(shared_resource, 0);
}
```

### `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`

Supports parameterized tests, allowing one test logic to run with multiple data inputs. This macro is crucial for data-driven testing in GoogleTest.


## 3. Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests declared with `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros by scanning the linked binary for test definitions registered during static initialization.

### How It Works:

- Each test macro registers the test name, test suite, and associated function with GoogleTest's internal framework.
- At runtime, `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` enumerates all tests and executes them sequentially or with specified filters.

This mechanism requires no manual test registration, enabling rapid test additions.

## 4. Recommended Patterns for Test Structure

### Grouping Related Tests into Suites

Use the same `test_suite` name for related tests. This grouping:

- Improves test output clarity.
- Allows shared fixtures for common setup/teardown.

### Use Fixtures for Shared Setups

Avoid repeating initialization or common data across tests by encapsulating it in a fixture class accessible using `TEST_F`.

### Prefer Writing Focused Tests

Each test should verify a single behavior or condition. This approach enhances test diagnostics and makes failures easier to interpret.

## 5. Example Workflow: Writing and Running Tests

<Steps>
<Step title="Define a Test Case">
Write your test using `TEST` or `TEST_F`:
```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Compile Your Tests">
Build your project linking against GoogleTest libraries.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Test Executable">
Run the compiled binary. GoogleTest auto-discovers and runs all tests.
</Step>
<Step title="Review Output">
Test results indicate passing/failing tests with file and line number detail.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Unique Test Names:** Ensure each test name within a suite is unique to avoid conflicts.
- **Descriptive Suite and Test Names:** Use descriptive names that convey what the test checks.
- **Avoid Side-Effects in Test Construction:** Keep test constructors light; use fixtures for setup.
- **Use Fixtures for Reusable Setup:** This prevents duplication and makes maintenance easier.
- **Combine Parameterized Tests When Possible:** To minimize code duplication.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Being Discovered

- Confirm test functions are linked.
- Verify that test macros are properly used.

### Duplicate Test Names

- Compiler or linker errors about duplicate symbols often mean test names clash.
- Rename suites or tests uniquely.

### Setup/Cleanup Not Running as Expected

- Check `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` overrides in fixtures are declared `override`.
- Avoid exceptions in setup/teardown to prevent test suite crashes.


## 8. Advanced Organization

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports `TEST_P` and `TYPED_TEST` for applying tests across multiple parameters or types respectively. These help maintain DRY principles and improve coverage.

### Partial Test Suite Execution

Run individual tests or suites using command-line filters `--gtest_filter` for faster development cycles.
