# Test Case and Suite Structure

GoogleTest organizes tests into test cases (also called test suites) and test methods (individual tests) using an xUnit-inspired structure. This page serves as a definitive reference for how to define and group tests, register test cases, and understand the underlying test discovery and execution model. Mastering this will empower you to architect scalable and maintainable test suites.

## Overview: Test Case and Test Suite Concepts

In GoogleTest, tests are organized into test suites (historically called test cases) which group together related tests. Each test is a method inside a suite that exercises a particular behavior or verifies a condition. This arrangement helps keep tests isolated, logically grouped, and discoverable.

Key concepts:

- **Test Suite (Test Case):** A collection of logically related tests, often corresponding to a class, component, or module under test.
- **Test:** An individual verification function usually declared with the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macro.
- **Test Fixture:** A class derived from `testing::Test` that provides setup and teardown for tests within a suite.

### Why Structure Tests This Way?

Grouping tests improves clarity and maintenance. It facilitates shared setup and teardown through fixtures, enables selective running/filtering of tests, and supports parallel execution. This structure makes it easier to reason about the coverage and behavior verified.

---

## Macros and Classes for Defining Tests

### `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`

The most fundamental unit of testing in GoogleTest. Declares a test named `TestName` that belongs to `TestSuiteName`. It defines a simple function with assertions inside.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

- **TestSuiteName:** Group name (should be a valid C++ identifier, no underscores recommended)
- **TestName:** Individual test name (valid C++ identifier)

Each `TEST` defines an independent test function with no shared fixtures.

### `TEST_F(TestFixtureClass, TestName)`

Declares a test that uses a test fixture class `TestFixtureClass` derived from `testing::Test`. Enables shared setup and teardown for multiple tests.

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue.Enqueue(42);
  }
  Queue<int> queue;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyAfterDequeue) {
  int* val = queue.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 42);
  EXPECT_EQ(queue.size(), 0);
  delete val;
}
```

- The test fixture constructor, `SetUp()`, and `TearDown()` run before and after each test method.
- Each test gets a fresh fixture instance.

### Test Suite and Test Fixture Classes

- `testing::Test`: The base class for test fixtures
- You write your own subclass, with optional `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` overrides or constructor/destructor for resource management.

**Best Practice:** Prefer `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` over constructors/destructors for exception safety.

---

## Test Discovery and Execution Model

GoogleTest automatically discovers and registers all tests declared with `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` at static initialization time. It takes care of running each test independently and reporting results.

- The `main()` function typically calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` which runs all registered tests.
- Tests can be filtered on command-line or runtime flags by suite name or test name.
- Tests run in order but should not depend on execution order.

### Test Registry

GoogleTest maintains a global registry of all test suites and their contained tests. This allows test runners to enumerate, execute, and report results.

## Defining Tests: Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Define a Test Suite or Fixture">
Create a test suite via `TEST` macro or a fixture class derived from `testing::Test` if you need shared setup/teardown.
</Step>
<Step title="Write Test Methods">
Use `TEST` for standalone tests or `TEST_F` to have tests use your fixture. Name tests clearly to express intent.
</Step>
<Step title="Write Assertions">
Inside each test, use GoogleTest assertion macros like `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, etc., to verify conditions and behaviors.
</Step>
<Step title="Build and Run Tests">
Link your test binary against `gtest` and `gmock`. Run the tests with arguments such as `--gtest_filter` to select tests.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Results">
GoogleTest reports any failed assertions with precise file/line info. Use this feedback to refine code or tests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Organizing Tests for Maintainability

- Group related tests into suites logically aligned with production code components.
- Use test fixtures to avoid duplication of setup/teardown.
- Name suites and tests descriptively; avoid underscores or special characters.
- Prefer granular tests verifying a single behavior to enhance clarity and debuggability.
- Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for parameterized tests (not covered here).

---

## Filtering, Running, and Selecting Tests

GoogleTest supports selecting subsets of tests using filters:

```shell
./my_tests --gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName
```

- Supports wildcards and multiple patterns.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to see all available tests.

---

## Test Lifecycle

Each test runs through:

1. Construction of fixture (if any)
2. `SetUp()` method
3. Test body
4. `TearDown()` method
5. Fixture destruction

Failures in setup/teardown affect test outcome.

---

## Practical Tips and Common Pitfalls

- Always declare your test fixtures with a virtual destructor.
- Do not call `EXPECT_CALL()` or similar mock expectations **after** the code under test has exercised the mock.
- Use `ASSERT_*` macros when failure should abort the test immediately.
- Remember tests are independent; avoid shared mutable state between tests.

---

## Troubleshooting Test Definitions

Below are typical issues when defining tests:

- Using an invalid test suite or test name (e.g., invalid characters).
- Forgetting to link against GoogleTest libraries.
- Missing the call to `testing::InitGoogleTest` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Calling mock expectations after mocks are exercised leads to undefined behavior.

Refer to the [Troubleshooting Common Issues](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues.md) for assistance.

## Related Macros and Utilities

- `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` for parameterized tests.
- `EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_EQ`, and a rich set of assertions.
- Mocks and stubs integration with GoogleMock.

## Code Example: Basic Test Suite

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Test suite "MathTest" with two tests.

TEST(MathTest, FactorialZero) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(MathTest, FactorialPositive) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(4), 24);
}
```

## Code Example: Test Fixture Usage

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    queue_.Enqueue(100);
  }

  Queue<int> queue_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsCorrectValue) {
  int* value = queue_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(value, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*value, 100);
  delete value;
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyAfterDequeue) {
  EXPECT_EQ(queue_.size(), 1);
  int* value = queue_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_NE(value, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(queue_.size(), 0);
  delete value;
}
```
