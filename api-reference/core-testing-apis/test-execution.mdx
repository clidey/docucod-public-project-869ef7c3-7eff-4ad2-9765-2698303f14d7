# Test Execution & Configuration

GoogleTest provides powerful APIs and configuration options to control how your tests are executed, filtered, and reported. This page details the main entry points and customization mechanisms available to guide you through running tests efficiently and tailoring test execution to your environment.

---

## 1. Overview of Test Execution

When running a test suite with GoogleTest, the core entry point is through the predefined `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` macro (typically invoked inside `main()`), which automatically discovers all defined tests and executes them. GoogleTest handles the lifecycle of test fixtures, manages output formatting, and reports aggregated results.

You can customize test execution by controlling the following key aspects:

- Selecting specific tests or test suites to run.
- Controlling the order of test execution.
- Running tests in parallel where supported.
- Adjusting runtime behavior via flags or environment variables.

---

## 2. Selecting and Filtering Tests

GoogleTest allows you to specify which tests to run via test selectors, enabling fast iteration and focused debugging.

### 2.1 Test Selection Using Filters

Use the `--gtest_filter` flag or the environment variable `GTEST_FILTER` to determine which tests to run.

- The filter format is a colon-separated list of wildcard patterns.
- Positive patterns specify tests to include; negative patterns exclude tests prefixed by a minus `-`.

**Examples:**

```bash
--gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*  # Run all tests in MyTestSuite
--gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.Test1:MyOtherSuite.*  # Run specific tests
--gtest_filter=-MyTestSuite.FlakyTest  # Run all tests except FlakyTest
```

### 2.2 Typical Filtering Workflow

- Start with no filter to run all tests to ensure full coverage.
- Use filters to re-run failing or targeted tests during debugging.
- Combine filters to isolate flaky tests or slow tests.

### 2.3 Common Pitfalls

- Filters are case-sensitive.
- Ensure no trailing or leading colons that could change filter behavior.

---

## 3. Controlling Test Order

### 3.1 Default Behavior

By default, tests are executed in the order of their registration within the binary. This order is generally predictable, but may vary depending on the platform and build details.

### 3.2 Manual Ordering

GoogleTest does not provide explicit APIs to reorder tests programmatically. To enforce order, consider:

- Designing tests to be independent and order-insensitive.
- Using naming conventions to prefix test names for lex order execution.
- Writing test suites with fixtures where test setup encodes ordering logic.

### 3.3 Nested Scopes and Fixtures

Shared setup and teardown via test fixtures (`TEST_F`) can control environmental states, but do not guarantee test call order.

---

## 4. Parallel Test Execution

Running tests in parallel can dramatically reduce feedback cycles for large test suites.

### 4.1 Built-in Support

Currently, GoogleTest itself does not inherently execute tests in parallel. Parallelism should be managed by your build system or test runner (e.g., Bazel, CTest).

### 4.2 Recommendations for Parallel Runs

- Write isolated tests with no dependency or shared mutable state.
- Use external tools or test orchestrators that spawn multiple test processes.
- Ensure thread safety in tests involving mocks and shared resources.

### 4.3 Troubleshooting Parallel Runs

- Be aware that mocked behaviors and global flags might lead to flakiness.
- Isolate tests with side effects or shared state into separate serial runs.

---

## 5. Customizing Test Execution via Flags and Environment Variables

GoogleTest offers a rich set of flags that control runtime behavior for test discovery, execution, output, and failure handling.

### 5.1 Important Command-line Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter`            | Specify which tests to run (see Section 2)         |
| `--gtest_repeat=N`          | Run all selected tests N times (for stress testing) |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`  | Trigger debugger on first failed assertion          |
| `--gtest_shuffle`           | Randomize test execution order                      |
| `--gtest_random_seed=SEED`  | Seed for test shuffling to allow reproducible runs  |
| `--gtest_print_time`        | Print each test's elapsed time after execution      |

### 5.2 Environment Variables

| Variable                | Purpose                                            |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_SHUFFLE`         | Enables test shuffling (true/false)               |
| `GTEST_PRINT_TIME`      | Enables timing output (true/false)                 |
| `GTEST_TAP_OUTPUT`      | Output results in TAP format (true/false)          |

### 5.3 Using Flags in Your Main Function

Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` early in your `main()` to initialize flags:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### 5.4 Best Practices

- Use flags during development to focus runs and gather diagnostics.
- Use environment variables in CI to standardize test execution across machines.

---

## 6. Integration Tips for Different Platforms

### 6.1 Linux and macOS

- Use shell scripts or Makefiles to invoke test binaries with appropriate flags.
- Leverage tools like `ctest` or `bazel` for parallel execution.

### 6.2 Windows

- Use native command prompts or PowerShell to run test executables.
- Integrate with Visual Studio Test Explorer and adjust flags accordingly.

### 6.3 Continuous Integration Environments

- Pass customized filters and flags via environment variables or CI pipeline configuration.
- Collect and parse output artifacts for reporting.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 7.1 Tests Not Running as Expected

- Verify filters do not exclude desired tests.
- Ensure tests are properly registered (test files included and linked).

### 7.2 Unexpected Test Execution Order

- Rename tests to order lexicographically if order matters.
- Rely on explicit test dependencies sparingly.

### 7.3 Parallel Runs Causing Failures

- Confirm tests are isolated and thread-safe.
- Consider reducing parallelism or isolating flaky tests.

### 7.4 Flags Not Taking Effect

- Confirm `InitGoogleTest()` is called prior to parsing.
- Check for conflicting flags being set elsewhere.

# Summary

GoogleTest grants you concise control and flexibility over how tests are executed, filtered, and reported. with fundamental command-line flags and environment variables powering the customization. While it does not inherently perform parallel test execution, combined integration with build tools allows you to scale test runs efficiently. Emphasizing orderly, repeatable, and filtered test suites enables rapid development and reliable debugging.
