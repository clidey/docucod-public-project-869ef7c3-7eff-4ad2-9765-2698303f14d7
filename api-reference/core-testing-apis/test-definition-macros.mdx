# Test Definitions and Registration

GoogleTest provides powerful macros and mechanisms to define and register tests and test fixtures. This page details the key interfaces and macros used for test definition, explains the syntax and customization options, and clarifies how GoogleTest discovers, organizes, and executes tests. Our goal is to make it straightforward for users to create robust, maintainable test suites that integrate seamlessly with the framework.

---

## 1. Overview of Test Definitions

GoogleTest introduces a declarative style for writing tests using macros that hide complex boilerplate code and enable concise test writing. The core idea revolves around defining test cases (also called test suites) and tests, plus optional setup/teardown fixtures.

- **Test Case / Test Suite:** A collection of related tests. Each test belongs to one test suite.
- **Test:** A unit of test code that exercises and validates some behavior.
- **Test Fixture:** A class that provides common setup and teardown code for all tests in a suite.

GoogleTest supports _discovery_ and automatic registration of tests, meaning that once defined, tests are automatically recognized by the framework without further registration steps.

---

## 2. Defining Tests: Key Macros and Syntax

GoogleTest's primary interface for defining tests is through its macros. They allow you to express your intent clearly and succinctly.

### TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)

Defines a simple test without shared setup or teardown. GoogleTest treats the two arguments as the test suite and test names.

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, DoesX) {
  // Arrange
  int value = 42;

  // Act
  int result = DoX(value);

  // Assert
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 42);
}
```

- The first argument (`FooTest`) groups related tests.
- The second argument (`DoesX`) names the specific test.

### TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)

Defines a test that uses a test fixture. The fixture is a class that inherits from `::testing::Test` and provides `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for common preparation and cleanup.

```cpp
class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Shared setup
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Shared cleanup
  }

  int shared_data_;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, Test1) {
  shared_data_ = 10;
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_data_, 10);
}
```

- `TEST_F` allows access to the fixture's methods and members.

### TEST_P and INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P for Parameterized Tests

GoogleTest supports data-driven testing via parameterized tests using `TEST_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`. These macros let you write one test that runs multiple times with different parameters.

```cpp
class ParamTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(ParamTest, IsPositive) {
  int value = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(value, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(Positives, ParamTest, ::testing::Values(1,2,3));
```

---

## 3. Test Fixtures: Organizing Setup and Teardown

Fixtures let you factor out common test preparation code, promoting maintainability and readability.

- Fixtures inherit from `::testing::Test`.
- Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for code that runs before/after each test method.
- Define member variables for shared state.
- Support constructor/destructor usage with the caveat that exceptions should be avoided in test setup.

### Example: Using Fixtures

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    ConnectToTestDB();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    DisconnectFromTestDB();
  }

  Database db_;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanInsert) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db_.Insert("key", "value"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, CanQuery) {
  db_.Insert("key", "value");
  EXPECT_EQ(db_.Query("key"), "value");
}
```

---

## 4. Test Discovery and Registration

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests defined with its macros at runtime without manual registration. This is possible because the `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros expand to code that registers the test with the framework before `main()` executes.

- Tests are organized by test suite names.
- Each test has a unique combination of test suite and test name.
- The built-in test runner lists all registered tests and executes them according to filters.
- Users can write custom test listeners and reporters to customize test execution beyond default behavior.

---

## 5. Customizing Test Behavior

GoogleTest supports several customization points once tests are defined:

- **DISABLE_ prefix**: Temporarily disable a test by prefixing its name with `DISABLED_`. Disabled tests are skipped by default.

- **Typed and Typed-Parameterized Tests**: Support more flexible parameterization by running the same test code over multiple types.

- **Death Tests**: Special tests that validate process termination scenarios.

- **Flags and Options**: Configuration such as test filtering, repeated runs, shuffling, and output format can control test execution.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Test Definitions

- Put related tests into meaningful test suites.
- Use fixtures to avoid repetition and improve test clarity.
- Keep each test method focused on a single behavior.
- Name suites and tests clearly to reflect intent.
- Use parameterized tests when the logic is the same and data varies.
- Avoid long complex setup; keep per-test setup lightweight.
- Combine GoogleTest assertions (`EXPECT_*`, `ASSERT_*`) with test macros for maximum expressiveness.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Test Definition Issues

- **Duplicate test names**: Ensure test suite and test names are unique.
- **Undefined symbols for tests**: Check that test definitions are included in the build.
- **Tests not run**: Confirm the proper usage of `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros and that the test executable is linked and executed correctly.
- **Test fixture mistakes**: Verify `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` signatures and that the fixture inherits publicly from `::testing::Test`.
- **Incorrect fixture prefixes**: Use `TEST_F` for fixture-based tests, `TEST` for independent tests.

## 9. Example: Complete Test Definition

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>  // Provides all test macros.

// A test suite named CalculatorTest.
TEST(CalculatorTest, Addition) {
  int result = 2 + 3;
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 5);
}

// Using a fixture.
class StackTest : public ::testing::Test {
public:
  void SetUp() override {
    stack_.Clear();
  }

protected:
  Stack<int> stack_;
};

TEST_F(StackTest, PushAndPop) {
  stack_.Push(10);
  EXPECT_EQ(stack_.Pop(), 10);
  EXPECT_TRUE(stack_.IsEmpty());
}
```

This concise code leverages GoogleTest's core macros to register tests, run them automatically, and provide detailed reporting.

## 10. Summary

Test definition macros are the entry point to writing tests with GoogleTest. Their declarative style provides clear, maintainable test code that integrates fully into GoogleTest's powerful execution and reporting model. Using fixtures and test suites enhances scalability and reusability. Coupled with mocking and assertion APIs, they support building comprehensive test suites.

## Callouts

<Tip>
Use `TEST` for simple, standalone tests without shared setup.
<Tip>
Use `TEST_F` to apply shared setup/teardown through fixtures.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Always name your test suites and tests clearly and consistently for easier maintenance.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not mix test definitions and test execution code; `EXPECT_CALL` and other mocking/setup code should be done before exercising the code under test.
</Warning>

<Note>
Test definitions automatically register testsâ€”no manual registration is required.
</Note>
