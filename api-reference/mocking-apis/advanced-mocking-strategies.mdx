# Advanced Mocking Features

Delve into the nuanced capabilities of GoogleMock's advanced mocking APIs that empower you to handle intricate and non-standard testing scenarios. This page comprehensively describes specialized mock types such as `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock`, along with techniques for variadic actions and crafting custom actions or matchers. By mastering these, you will refine your ability to create precise, maintainable, and resilient test doubles.

## Mock Strictness Wrappers

GoogleMock provides three wrapper templates that control how uninteresting calls (method calls on mocks without explicit expectations) are handled. By choosing the appropriate wrapper, you can fine-tune the strictness level of your mocks and the feedback they emit during tests.

### NiceMock

`NiceMock<T>` is a subclass of your mock class `T` that suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls. Use it when uninteresting calls are expected or benign, allowing your tests to focus only on explicitly expected interactions.

**Usage example:**

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;

NiceMock<MockClass> mock_obj("argument");
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething());
... code exercising mock_obj ...
```

- **When to use:** When you want to ignore uninteresting calls without polluting your test output with warnings.

- **Limitations:** Only affects methods defined with `MOCK_METHOD` directly in `T`. May behave incorrectly if the destructor of `T` is not virtual.

### NaggyMock

`NaggyMock<T>` is the default behavior of mocks (currently), which generates warnings when uninteresting calls happen.

**Usage example:**

```cpp
using ::testing::NaggyMock;

NaggyMock<MockClass> mock_obj("argument");
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething());
... code exercising mock_obj ...
```

- **When to use:** Default choice when you want to be notified of calls not explicitly expected, useful for debugging and detecting unintended calls.

### StrictMock

`StrictMock<T>` turns warnings for uninteresting calls into test failures. Use this when you want your tests to enforce *exact* expected call interactions and consider any calls outside specification as errors.

**Usage example:**

```cpp
using ::testing::StrictMock;

StrictMock<MockClass> mock_obj("argument");
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething());
... code exercising mock_obj ...
```

- **When to use:** When rigorous verification is needed, and any unanticipated call should cause a test failure.

- **Caution:** Like `NiceMock`, only affects methods defined directly in `T`; improper destructor design impacts behavior.

## Variadic Actions

While GoogleMock macros support mocking methods with fixed arguments, handling variadic functions (`...`) is not directly supported. To mock such functions, you must manually implement overloads that encapsulate argument unpacking or provide wrapper interfaces extracting variadic arguments into tuples or containers.

GoogleMock empowers you to define actions for such cases by using callable objects or lambdas capturing variable argument packs. For example, you can define an action that accepts `std::vector` or `std::tuple` representing the variadic arguments and then use lambda-based actions with `Invoke()` or similar helpers to simulate variadic functions.

When dealing with variadic functions:

- Consider wrapping the variadic function interface with fixed parameter helper functions.
- Use lambdas or functors to specify custom side effects or return values.
- Utilize `Invoke()` or `InvokeWithoutArgs()` to define complex behaviors.

## Custom Actions and Matchers

Custom actions and matchers let you extend GoogleMock's expressive power to handle domain-specific validation and behavior verification beyond built-in matchers and actions.

### Defining Custom Action Classes

Implement an action by providing a callable type compatible with the mocked function signature. For example:

```cpp
struct MultiplyBy {
  template <typename T>
  T operator()(T arg) { return arg * multiplier; }
  int multiplier;
};

// Usage
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_))
    .WillOnce(MultiplyBy{7});
```

The callable can be a lambda, struct, or class with the appropriate `operator()`.

### Writing Custom Matchers

There are several ways to define matchers:

- **Using `MATCHER` and `MATCHER_P` macros:** concise and well-integrated.

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "") { return (arg % 7) == 0; }

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(IsDivisibleBy7()));
```

- **Implementing the matcher interface:** For advanced scenarios requiring detailed control.

- **Polymorphic matchers:** Matchers that adapt to different argument types, useful for generic interfaces.

### Tips for Custom Matchers

- Provide descriptive failure messages by overriding `DescribeTo()` and `DescribeNegationTo()`.
- Use `MatchAndExplain()` to give detailed diagnostics.
- Ensure matchers are pure functions with no side effects.

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Choosing Strictness Levels

- Favor `NiceMock` in most tests to reduce noise and focus on explicitly expected behaviors.
- Use `NaggyMock` or default mocks during test development to catch stray calls.
- Adopt `StrictMock` sparingly, mainly when exact call specifications are crucial.

### Managing Expectation Lifecycles

- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to automatically retire expectations after their call limit is reached, avoiding upper-bound violations.
- Use `Sequence` and `InSequence` to enforce call order where needed.

### Handling Move-only Types

GoogleMock supports move-only types in mocked functions. Use lambda actions or `Return()` with move semantics to handle move-only return values or parameters gracefully.

### Debugging Unexpected Calls

- Employ `--gmock_verbose=info` flag to get detailed tracing of mock method calls and matched expectations.
- Review call arguments and expectation order carefully.
- Check that matchers and cardinalities accurately reflect your intent.

### Suppressing Uninteresting Call Warnings

Use `NiceMock` or add catch-all expectations:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Method(_)).Times(AnyNumber());
```

Avoid suppressing warnings by excessively adding expectations on unintended calls.
