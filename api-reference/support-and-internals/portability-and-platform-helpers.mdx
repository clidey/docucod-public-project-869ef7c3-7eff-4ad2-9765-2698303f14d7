# Portability and Platform Helpers

GoogleTest includes a foundational set of low-level compatibility APIs, environment detection features, and synchronization utilities designed to ensure consistent behavior across diverse platforms. These core utilities enable GoogleTest to run reliably on supported operating systems by abstracting away platform-specific differences, managing environment quirks, and providing safe concurrency primitives.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest supports a wide range of platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, and many POSIX-based systems. This page documents the internal portability APIs and helpers that provide:

- **Environment Detection:** Compile-time macros and runtime queries that identify the target OS, platform capabilities, and compiler support.
- **File and Path Handling:** Utilities and abstractions for consistent file system interactions, including path separators, file descriptor management, and directory operations.
- **String and Character Utilities:** Portable functions for character classification and transformations, supporting various encodings and character types.
- **Threading and Synchronization:** Cross-platform implementations of mutexes, locks, thread-local storage, and notification primitives that maintain thread safety across supported systems.
- **Configuration Macros and Flags:** Macros that control GoogleTest behavior depending on platform features such as exceptions, RTTI, and thread safety.

These components together guarantee GoogleTest’s core functionalities behave identically regardless of the underlying system.

---

## Environment Detection and Configuration

GoogleTest automatically detects platform, compiler, and environment capabilities through internal macros defined in `gtest-port-arch.h` and `gtest-port.h`. These macros enable conditional compilation of code specific to:

- Operating systems (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`)
- Compiler features (e.g., support for exceptions, RTTI, C++17 compatibility)
- Threading support (e.g., presence of pthreads or Windows threading primitives)
- File system availability

**Key Macros:**

- `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS` – Whether C++ exceptions are enabled
- `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` – Whether pthreads library is available
- `GTEST_HAS_RTTI` – Whether RTTI is enabled
- `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` – Whether GoogleTest is built with thread safety
- `GTEST_PATH_SEP_` – Platform-specific file path separator (e.g., `"/"` or `"\"`)

Users typically do not need to define these macros manually; however, overriding them can be helpful in custom or constrained environments.

---

## File System and Path Utilities

GoogleTest abstracts file system interactions to behave consistently across platforms:

### Path Handling

- **Path Separator**

  A macro `GTEST_PATH_SEP_` defines the default path separator (`'/'` on Unix-like systems, `'\\'` on Windows).

- **Alternate Separator Support**

  Windows supports an alternate separator; `GTEST_HAS_ALT_PATH_SEP_` indicates support.

### File and Directory Operations

Within the internal namespace `testing::internal::posix`, GoogleTest wraps common POSIX-like file system functions to normalize platform differences:

| Function      | Description                                  | Notes                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `FOpen`       | Portable wrapper for `fopen()`. Uses wide-character API on Windows.
| `FReopen`     | Reopens a file stream.
| `FDOpen`      | Creates a file stream from file descriptor.
| `FClose`      | Closes a file stream.
| `Read`        | Reads bytes from a file descriptor.
| `Write`       | Writes bytes to a file descriptor.
| `Close`       | Closes a file descriptor.
| `Stat`        | Retrieves file status.
| `RmDir`       | Removes directory.
| `IsDir`       | Determines if a `Stat` structure represents a directory.

### Terminal Detection

- **`IsATTY(fd)`**

  Checks if the file descriptor refers to a terminal device, maintaining `errno` correctly and adapting calls for Windows and POSIX systems.


### Case-Insensitive String Comparison

- `StrCaseCmp(const char* s1, const char* s2)`

  Performs case-insensitive string comparison, mapping to `_stricmp` on Windows and `strcasecmp` on POSIX.

---

## Character Utilities

GoogleTest provides robust, locale-independent character classification and conversion functions that work safely with signed and unsigned character types as well as wide and UTF-encoded characters:

- `IsAlpha(char ch)` – Checks if character is alphabetic
- `IsDigit(char ch)` – Checks if character is a decimal digit
- `IsSpace(char ch)` – Checks if character is a whitespace
- `IsXDigit(char ch)` – Checks if character is a hexadecimal digit
- `ToLower(char ch)` – Converts to lowercase
- `ToUpper(char ch)` – Converts to uppercase

These functions cast the input characters to `unsigned char` internally to prevent undefined behavior caused by signed characters.

---

## Threading and Synchronization Primitives

To ensure thread-safe test execution across platforms, GoogleTest implements synchronization utilities:

### Mutex and Lock

- On Windows:
  - `Mutex` wraps Windows critical section APIs
  - `MutexLock` (also known as `GTestMutexLock`) provides scoped locking
- On POSIX systems:
  - `Mutex` wraps `pthread_mutex_t`
  - `MutexLock` provides RAII locking
- If thread safety is disabled or unsupported, dummy implementations are provided with no locking behavior.

### ThreadLocal Storage

- Provides thread-local variables compatible with:
  - Windows TLS APIs
  - POSIX `pthread_key_t`
  - Fallback dummy implementations if threads are not supported

Example usage involves creating a ThreadLocal variable per thread to hold data safely without cross-thread interference.

### Notification

- Used internally for controlling test thread execution.
- Provides signaling primitives for threads to wait on or notify.

### Thread Count

- `GetThreadCount()` returns the number of threads running in the process when detectable; otherwise returns 0.

---

## Regular Expression Support

GoogleTest abstracts its regex implementation to maintain cross-platform consistency:

- Uses RE2 via Abseil if available
- Falls back to POSIX Extended Regular Expressions on most Unix-like systems
- Uses a lightweight built-in regex implementation otherwise

The class `testing::internal::RE` wraps the underlying regex engine with a unified interface for full and partial matching.

---

## Miscellaneous Utilities

### Logging

- Macros and classes like `GTEST_LOG_(severity)` and `GTestLog` for consistent logging with severity levels.

### POSIX Wrappers

- Wrappers around functions like `chdir`, `isatty`, and error string retrieval (`strerror`) to bridge platform differences.

### Integer and Type Utilities

- `BiggestInt` typedef for largest signed integer supported by compiler.
- Template `TypeWithSize<size>` helps map size to integral types.

---

## Example Use: Writing Cross-Platform Tests

By relying on these portability helpers, a test can:

- Use `GTEST_PATH_SEP_` to build file paths:

  ```c++
  std::string filepath = std::string("test") + GTEST_PATH_SEP_ + "data.txt";
  ```

- Use thread-safe locks regardless of underlying platform:

  ```c++
  testing::internal::Mutex mutex;
  {
    testing::internal::MutexLock lock(&mutex);
    // Thread-safe code here
  }
  ```

- Use `IsAlpha()` and other character utilities for safe, portable character checks.

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Thread Safety:** Ensure your environment supports pthreads or Windows threading for full thread safety.
- **Environment Macros:** Avoid manually overriding the automatic platform detection macros unless necessary for embedded or unusual environments.
- **Build Requirements:** Compile GoogleTest with at least C++17 support to leverage all portability features.
- **File System Operations:** Use internal wrappers if you require portable file or path manipulation to avoid subtle bugs on Windows or embedded platforms.
