# Internal Utilities and Extensions

This page covers essential internal helpers, type traits, failure reporting, and logging utilities provided by GoogleTest and GoogleMock. These components are primarily intended for advanced users and framework integrators who need to extend or customize the testing framework's behavior.

Note that most internal utilities are subject to change without notice and **should not be used directly in user test code** unless you are extending the framework itself.

---

## Failure Reporting

The framework includes an interface for reporting test failures:

- **`FailureReporterInterface`**: Defines the contract for reporting failures with severity (non-fatal or fatal), file, line, and message.
- The default implementation, **`GoogleTestFailureReporter`**, integrates with Google Test's assertion failure mechanism to report failures appropriately.
- The global instance can be accessed via **`GetFailureReporter()`** to report framework or mock-specific failures.

### Assertion Helpers

Two core inline functions help assert and expect conditions within the framework:

- **`Assert(condition, file, line, message)`**: Aborts test execution when the `condition` is false by reporting a fatal failure.
- **`Expect(condition, file, line, message)`**: Reports a non-fatal failure without halting test execution.

These provide a foundation for implementing assertion-like checks internal to mock or test utilities.

## Logging Utilities

GoogleMock provides a flexible logging facility controlled by the command-line flag `--gmock_verbose` with these levels:

- `info`: Logs all information, warnings, and errors, including call traces.
- `warning`: Logs only warnings and errors (default).
- `error`: Logs only errors.

The following utilities are exposed internally:

- **`LogIsVisible(LogSeverity severity)`**: Checks if a message with the given severity level should be output based on current verbosity.
- **`Log(LogSeverity severity, const std::string& message, int stack_frames_to_skip)`**: Logs the message with optional stack trace. Ensures thread-safe output.

These enable detailed diagnostic output during mock evaluation, especially helpful when debugging complex test scenarios.

## Type Traits and Helper Utilities

Internal utilities include sophisticated type traits and helper functions to support GoogleMock's matcher and action systems:

- **`KindOf<T>`** and **`TypeKind`** traits classify types as `kBool`, `kInteger`, `kFloatingPoint`, or `kOther`.
- **`LosslessArithmeticConvertible<From, To>`** trait determines if arithmetic conversions between built-in types are safe and lossless.
- **`GetRawPointer(p)`** template returns the underlying raw pointer for raw pointers, `std::reference_wrapper`, or smart pointers.

These traits help safely cast matchers and verify argument types and conversions during mock matching.

## String and Identifier Utilities

- **`JoinAsKeyValueTuple(names, values)`**: Joins a vector of strings into a key-value tuple-like string representation.
- **`ConvertIdentifierNameToWords(id_name)`**: Transforms camelCase and underscore-separated identifiers into a space-separated, lowercase word list.

These are helpful for generating readable debugging and error messages from internal names.

## Container Adaptors

GoogleMock supports matching and inspecting STL-style containers and native arrays uniformly:

- **`StlContainerView<RawContainer>`** template adapts native arrays, pointers with sizes, or STL containers into a uniform interface for reading elements.
- Specializations provide mechanisms to view data as either constant references or copies, enabling flexible container matchers.

This allows matchers to work seamlessly with arrays or standard containers like `std::vector`, `std::array`, and others without additional work by the user.

## Tuple and Function Utilities

Utilities facilitate working with tuples and function signatures in matcher and action implementations:

- **`Function<F>`** template extracts the return type, argument types, and argument matcher tuple for a function type `F`.
- **`Apply(F f, Tuple args)`**: Calls a callable `f` with arguments unpacked from a tuple `args`.

These simplify generic lambda and action implementations.

## Logging Verbosity Control

Logging output in GoogleMock is governed by the `--gmock_verbose` flag, which accepts the following values:

| Level   | Description                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `info`  | Prints all logs, including informational messages.
| `warning` | Prints warnings and errors only (default).
| `error` | Prints only error messages.

Setting the appropriate verbosity can reduce log noise or enable detailed tracing for debugging tests and mocks.

## Advanced Logging Internals

Internally, the logging output is serialized with a mutex to prevent message interleaving from multiple threads.

Warnings are prefixed with `GMOCK WARNING:` to make them easy to locate in verbose logs.

Stack traces are optionally printed if enabled, including skipping specified stack frames to improve relevance.

## Usage Scenario: Framework Extension and Custom Mock Development

The utilities presented here are invaluable when you build custom matchers, actions, or mock behaviors that need:

- Precise type trait checks and conversions ensuring type safety.
- Custom failure reporting that integrates cleanly with Google Test.
- Custom logging and verbosity control for advanced debugging within mocks.
- Container and tuple adaptors for flexible argument inspection.

For example, if you are creating a new matcher that works with containers of custom types, the **`StlContainerView`** and **`JoinAsKeyValueTuple`** may help to write readable descriptions.

If a custom matcher fails and needs to report detailed messages, **`FailureReporterInterface`** and **`Assert`/`Expect`** functions provide the needed hooks.

## Best Practices and Caveats

- **Do not use these internal utilities in your test source code unless extending the framework.** The interfaces are unstable and undocumented for user code.
- Prefer public APIs like GoogleTest assertion macros, GoogleMock matchers, and actions unless you have a strong reason.
- Use `--gmock_verbose` to control logging output from tests and mocks for easier diagnosis.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see unexpected warnings or errors from mocks, increase verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock expectations and actual calls in detail.
- Use the **`GetRawPointer`** helper to debug issues related to raw vs smart pointer mismatches in matchers.
- For failures related to type conversions in matchers, verify that your matcher argument types satisfy `LosslessArithmeticConvertible` constraints.
