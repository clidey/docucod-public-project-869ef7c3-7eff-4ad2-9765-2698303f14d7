# Platform Portability Utilities

This page documents the foundational macros, types, and configuration utilities that enable GoogleTest and GoogleMock to operate reliably across a wide range of compilers, platforms, and environments. These platform portability utilities abstract platform-specific details, detect supported features, and provide safe thread synchronization and low-level OS interactions essential for the testing framework's internal operation.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to be portable and robust across various operating systems and compilers. This portability layer:

- Detects platform and compiler capabilities.
- Defines macros controlling environmental features.
- Provides synchronization primitives like mutexes and thread-local storage.
- Wraps platform-specific system calls and file handling.
- Manages thread safety and atomic operations.

The utilities are defined primarily in `gtest-port.h`, `gtest-port-arch.h`, and `gmock-port.h`. Users and integrators typically do not need to modify these but should understand their role to troubleshoot platform-specific issues.

---

## Compiler and Platform Detection

The utilities begin by detecting the environment:

- **Compiler version checks:** For example, ensuring Visual C++ version is sufficient.
- **OS-specific macros:** Identify Linux, Windows (desktop, mobile, MinGW), macOS, Android, BSD variants, Solaris, and others.
- **Feature availability macros:** Features like pthreads, exceptions, RTTI, POSIX regex, stream redirection, and death test support are flagged.

The detection occurs primarily in `gtest-port-arch.h`, defining macros like `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, and others.

### Example Checks

```cpp
#if defined(_MSC_VER) && _MSC_VER < 1900
#error "At least Visual C++ 2015 (14.0) is required to compile Google Mock."
#endif

#ifdef __CYGWIN__
#define GTEST_OS_CYGWIN 1
#elif defined _WIN32
#define GTEST_OS_WINDOWS 1
// ...
#endif
```

## Platform Feature Flags

GoogleTest platform flags, normalized to `0` or `1`, indicate available capabilities:

| Macro                       | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`          | Pthread support available.                           |
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`       | C++ exceptions enabled.                              |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`             | Run-Time Type Information enabled.                   |
| `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`         | POSIX regex available.                               |
| `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`      | `std::wstring` supported correctly.                 |
| `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`      | File system APIs available.                          |
| `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`       | Death tests supported on this platform.             |
| `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` | Stream redirection supported (for capturing stdout/stderr). |

These macros empower tests and tests framework internals to adapt their implementation seamlessly.

## Threading and Synchronization Primitives

Thread safety is critical. GoogleTest ports synchronization primitives depending on the platform:

- **Mutex and Locks:**
  - On Windows, uses critical sections wrapped in `Mutex` and `MutexLock` classes.
  - On pthreads platforms (Linux, macOS, others), wraps `pthread_mutex_t`.
  - On non-threadsafe platforms, uses dummy noop implementations.

- **Thread Local Storage (TLS):**
  - Uses platform-specific TLS mechanisms.
  - Provides a `ThreadLocal<T>` template for storing per-thread data.

- **Thread Abstractions:**
  - For platforms with pthreads, thread creation wrappers exist.
  - On Windows, thread abstractions use Windows handles.

This ensures test code and framework internals behave correctly when executed concurrently.

### Example: Mutex Usage

```cpp
// Lock acquisition
Mutex mutex;
{
  MutexLock lock(&mutex);  // RAII style lock
  // Critical section
}
// mutex unlocked automatically when lock goes out of scope
```

---

## Platform-Dependent Wrappers for OS Calls

Some system calls and C library functions have different names or semantics across platforms, so GoogleTest wraps these to unify usage:

| Functionality         | Platform Variants / Wrappers                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| File descriptor map   | `FileNo(FILE*)` returns file descriptor (uses `_fileno` on Windows, `fileno` elsewhere)
| File and directory ops| `Stat()`, `RmDir()`, `IsDir()` adapt to Windows or POSIX APIs
| Stream handling       | `FOpen()`, `FReopen()`, `FDOpen()` wrapped to handle UTF-16 on Windows
| Environment variables | A safe `GetEnv()` that returns `nullptr` if unsupported (embedded platforms)
| Terminal detection    | `IsATTY(fd)`, abstracts platform-specific `isatty()`

This abstraction removes platform-specific ifdefs from framework logic.

## Character Utilities

Platform portability utilities include safe character classification:

- Wrapper functions for `isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `isspace()`, etc., always accepting safely cast unsigned chars to avoid undefined behavior.

- Utility for case conversions (`ToLower`, `ToUpper`) and trailing space trimming.

This consistency supports portable string handling in the test framework.

---

## Regular Expression Support

GoogleTest supports regular expressions through one of these approaches depending on platform capabilities:

- **RE2 library used with Abseil support (recommended).**
- **POSIX regex on Unix-like platforms if available.**
- **Built-in simple regex engine as a fallback.**

This enables cross-platform regex matching used in filtering tests by name and other features reliably.

---

## Command Line Flags and Environment Variable Interface

Flags control test framework behavior, and platform portability code facilitates:

- Uniform referencing of flags via macros like `GTEST_FLAG(name)` and `GMOCK_FLAG(name)`.
- Conditional flag definition using Abseil flags or plain variables when Abseil is absent.
- Conversion utilities parsing environment variables into typed values.

This allows platform-independent flag management centralized through these utilities.

---

## Example Integration Snippet

Here is a typical usage pattern where platform-dependent mutex is acquired safely:

```cpp
#include <gtest/internal/gtest-port.h>

::testing::internal::Mutex g_test_mutex;

void ThreadSafeFunction() {
  ::testing::internal::MutexLock lock(&g_test_mutex);
  // Critical section: thread safe
}
```

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Avoid direct use of portability macros or platform-specific code in your tests unless necessary.
- Use the GoogleTest public API and test macros to write portable tests.
- For integrating in custom environments, consult and optionally extend `custom/gtest-port.h` or `custom/gmock-port.h`.
- Be aware of the thread safety guarantees provided by these primitives when running parallel tests.
- When adding new platforms, evaluate support macros and synchronization implementation accordingly.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Compilation failures due to unsupported compilers:** Ensure your compiler supports C++17 or higher and meets minimum version requirements (e.g., MSVC 2015+).
- **Linker errors related to pthread:** Pass correct threading flags or link flags as your build environment requires.
- **Flags not applying correctly:** Confirm `InitGoogleTest` or `InitGoogleMock` called at the start; flag macros depend on proper initialization.
- **Thread-related crashes:** Verify your environment correctly defines threading support macros or disable multi-threading support if your platform is incompatible.

---

## Sources and Customization

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support user customization through the `custom/` directory where:

- Custom `gtest-port.h` and `gmock-port.h` headers can override or extend platform settings and features.
- Users can declare or define flags, synchronization, or logging behavior customized to their environment.

Refer to the [Customization Points](googletest/include/gtest/internal/custom/README.md) for advanced usage.
