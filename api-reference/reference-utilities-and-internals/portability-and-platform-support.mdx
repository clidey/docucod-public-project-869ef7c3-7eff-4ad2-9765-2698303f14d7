# Portability and Platform Support Utilities

GoogleTest exposes a set of low-level utility APIs designed to ensure seamless cross-platform compatibility across various operating systems and environments. These utilities form the backbone for consistent and robust test execution regardless of platform differences. This documentation covers the key functions, classes, and macros involved in threading, file management, environment detection, string handling, regex selection, synchronization, and other essential portability features.

---

## 1. Platform Detection and Environment Macros

GoogleTest automatically detects the underlying platform via predefined macros and exposes these through consistent macros such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, `GTEST_OS_ANDROID`, and many others. This enables platform-specific conditional compilation where necessary.

Key points:
- Macros are defined to 1 if the platform matches, otherwise undefined.
- Supported platforms include Windows (desktop, mobile, phone, RT), Linux (including Android), Mac OS (including iOS), Unix-like systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, etc.), z/OS, QNX, and embedded targets (ESP8266, ESP32).
- Feature-detection macros such as `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`, `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`, `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`, and others control platform-specific support.

> **Tip:** Use these macros to write portable tests or to selectively enable features like death tests only on supported platforms.

## 2. Cross-Platform File and Directory Utilities

GoogleTest provides wrappers and abstractions over common file and directory operations that behave consistently across platforms:

- **File Management Functions inside `internal::posix` namespace:**
  - `FOpen()`: Opens files with platform-specific wide-string support on Windows.
  - `FReopen()`, `FDOpen()`: Reopen and associate file pointers.
  - `FClose()`: Close a file handle.
  - `Stat()`: Retrieves file status information.
  - `RmDir()`: Removes a directory.
  - `IsDir()`: Checks if a `StatStruct` indicates a directory.

- Internally, these functions handle differences such as `_wfopen` on Windows vs `fopen` on Unix.
- `FileNo()` returns the file descriptor in a cross-platform way.

> **Best Practice:** Favor these portability wrappers rather than direct system calls for filesystem operations to avoid platform-specific bugs.

## 3. Environment Variable Utilities

Obtaining environment variable values is done through a unified API:

- `internal::posix::GetEnv(const char* name)` returns the value or `nullptr` if unset.
- On embedded platforms or restricted environments, environment variables may not be available.

This is critical for flags, configuration, and test shard discovery.

## 4. Threading and Synchronization

GoogleTest supports multi-threading across major platforms using native primitives:

### Mutex
- Implements a mutex class with lock/unlock semantics.
- On Windows uses native critical sections (`CRITICAL_SECTION`), on pthread systems uses `pthread_mutex_t`.
- Supports `AssertHeld()` to help catch programming errors.
- Also provides macros for declaring and defining static mutexes (`GTEST_DECLARE_STATIC_MUTEX_` and `GTEST_DEFINE_STATIC_MUTEX_`).

### Mutex Lock Guard
- `MutexLock` (aliased to `GTestMutexLock`) locks a given mutex upon construction and unlocks on destruction, enabling RAII-style lock management.

### Thread Local Storage (TLS)
- Template class `ThreadLocal<T>` manages per-thread instances of objects.
- Provides methods: `get()`, `set()`, and `pointer()` for access.
- On pthreads platforms, uses `pthread_key_create` and `pthread_setspecific` with cleanup callbacks.
- On Windows, uses thread-specific data APIs.
- On non-threadsafe builds, degrades gracefully to single-instance behavior.

### Thread Counting
- Function `GetThreadCount()` returns an estimate of the number of active threads.
- On supported platforms, attempts to provide accurate counts; otherwise returns 0.

### Thread With Param
- Helper class `ThreadWithParam<T>` for launching a thread with a parameter and joining it.
- Intended for internal testing purposes.

## 5. String Handling Utilities

GoogleTest internal utility functions facilitate safe cross-platform handling of strings:

- Case-insensitive string comparison:
  - `String::CaseInsensitiveCStringEquals` for `char*` strings
  - `String::CaseInsensitiveWideCStringEquals` for wide strings

- Safe C-string equality comparison handling null pointers: `String::CStringEquals` and `String::WideCStringEquals`.

- Wide string conversions:
  - UTF-16 wide strings to UTF-8 (including surrogate pair handling) with `WideStringToUtf8`.
  - Display functions for wide strings.

- String formatting helpers:
  - `FormatIntWidth2`, `FormatIntWidthN` for zero-padded numbers.
  - Hex formatting for integers and bytes (`FormatHexUInt32`, `FormatHexInt`, `FormatByte`).

- Utility to strip trailing spaces from strings.

## 6. Regular Expression Selection

Based on the underlying platform and compilation options, GoogleTest chooses the most appropriate regex engine:

- Preference for RE2 (via Abseil) when available (`GTEST_USES_RE2`).
- Otherwise uses POSIX Extended regex (`GTEST_USES_POSIX_RE`) where supported.
- Falls back to a built-in simple regex engine (`GTEST_USES_SIMPLE_RE`) on unsupported platforms.

The regex wrapper class `RE` abstracts over the different implementations with a consistent interface.

> **Note:** When writing tests involving regex, the engine bucket may affect supported patterns.

## 7. Stack Trace Gathering

GoogleTest supports capturing and displaying stack traces on failures:

- Class `OsStackTraceGetter` provides method `CurrentStackTrace(int max_depth, int skip_count)` that returns a formatted stack trace string.
- Integration with Abseil stacktrace & symbolize libraries if enabled.
- Ability to elide internal GoogleTest stack frames.

## 8. Logging, Checks, and Assertions

- Macros like `GTEST_CHECK_` provide all-mode assertions that abort on failure.
- `GTEST_LOG_(severity)` logs messages at specified levels (Info, Warning, Error, Fatal).
- Logging and assertions include file and line information and optionally a stack trace.

## 9. Test Filtering, Sharding, and Environment Flags

Supports advanced filtering and sharding:

- User tests are filtered based on `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable.
- Supports positive and negative filters with glob patterns (`*`, `?`).
- Sharding support via environment variables `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`, `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` enables parallel test execution across shards.
- Implements consistent validation of sharding environment and aborts if misconfigured.

## 10. Miscellaneous Platform Support Utilities

- Provides macros and utility functions for character classification that safely handle signedness and multi-byte character types.
- Implements UTF-8 and Unicode code point conversions for cross-platform consistency.
- Safe handling of file name and line number formatting.

# Practical Usage and Integration

### Initialization

Users integrate these utilities mostly indirectly via the GoogleTest framework initialization and test macros. However, some utilities like `TempDir()` or environment variable queries may be used in custom test setups or environment fixtures.

### Thread-Safe Test Implementations

GoogleTest's internal use of mutexes and thread local storages enables thread-safe test execution. When writing user tests that employ concurrency, these utilities ensure underlying synchronization primitives behave consistently.

### Example: Checking Platform and Using File Utilities
```cpp
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
#include "gtest/internal/gtest-port.h"

TEST(PortabilityTest, TempDirUsage) {
  std::string temp_path = testing::TempDir();
  FILE* file = testing::internal::posix::FOpen((temp_path + "tempfile.tmp").c_str(), "w");
  ASSERT_NE(file, nullptr);
  fprintf(file, "Hello GoogleTest!\n");
  testing::internal::posix::FClose(file);
}
```

# Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Thread Safety**: Only use GoogleTest threading utilities in test code or supporting code, not production code.
- **File System Access**: When GoogleTest is built without file system support enabled, avoid using file utilities.
- **Environment Variables**: On platforms without environment support (embedded), environment-based features like sharding won't work.
- **Regular Expressions**: Be aware of the regex engine selected depending on your platform and compile flags.
- **Unicode Handling**: Use GoogleTest string utilities for cross-platform wide string management.

---

# Troubleshooting

- If `TempDir()` or file-opening fails, verify proper environment variables like `TEST_TMPDIR` are set or fallback directories exist.
- Unexpected `GetThreadCount()` values could indicate unsupported platform or test environment restrictions.
- Stack traces may be empty if Abseil dependencies are not available or enabled.
