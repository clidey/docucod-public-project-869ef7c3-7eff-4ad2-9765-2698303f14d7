# GoogleTest Internal Porting and Utilities

This reference page details the advanced internal facilities of GoogleTest's porting layers and utilities, primarily provided via the internal header `gtest-port.h`. These utilities underpin GoogleTest's portability and customization to diverse platforms, serving as foundational infrastructure for adaptation to non-standard or embedded environments.

> ⚠️ Warning: All macros ending with an underscore (_), internal namespaces, and symbols described here are internal implementation details. They are subject to change without notice and are NOT intended for direct use outside GoogleTest.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

`gtest-port.h` encapsulates low-level types, utilities, synchronization primitives, platform abstraction layers, compiler feature detection, and environment description macros. It provides GoogleTest the means to:

- Detect and adapt to different operating systems and environment constraints
- Enable or disable features like threading, exceptions, RTTI, regular expressions
- Implement cross-platform synchronization and thread-local storage
- Wrap native OS and standard library calls for portability
- Provide logging and error reporting mechanisms aligned to target platforms

This header is included by virtually all GoogleTest source files, yet explicitly isolates itself by not depending on other GoogleTest headers.

Users should not rely on the interfaces or macros defined here unless explicitly building custom integrations for non-standard platforms.

---

## 2. Environment Describing Macros

GoogleTest auto-detects the current environment through a series of macros, which are always defined to either 0 or 1 by the end of this header:

| Macro                          | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GTEST_HAS_CLONE`              | Indicates if `clone(2)` syscall is available (typically Linux).       |
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`         | Exception support availability                                        |
| `GTEST_HAS_POSIX_RE`           | POSIX Regular Expressions availability                                |
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`            | POSIX threads availability                                            |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`               | Run-time Type Information support                                     |
| `GTEST_HAS_STD_WSTRING`        | Whether `std::wstring` is supported                                  |
| `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`        | File system availability                                             |
| `GTEST_HAS_SEH`                | Support for Microsoft's Structured Exception Handling (SEH)          |
| `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` | Support for I/O stream redirection (`dup()`, `dup2()`)               |

Users may override some of these macros via build scripts if the auto-detection is imperfect.

---

## 3. Platform Indicating Macros

GoogleTest defines platform-specific macros automatically, which signal the OS or environment it's built for. These macros are **never defined to 0** — they are either defined to 1 or not defined at all.

**Examples include:**

- `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`
- `GTEST_OS_LINUX` / `GTEST_OS_LINUX_ANDROID`
- `GTEST_OS_MAC` / `GTEST_OS_IOS`
- `GTEST_OS_CYGWIN`
- `GTEST_OS_FREEBSD`, etc.

Applications can use these macros to conditionally compile platform-specific code.

Note that lack of any OS macro definition is possible if the OS is unknown or unsupported.

---

## 4. Feature Detection and Implementation Macros

Various features are conditionally enabled based upon compiler or platform capabilities and GoogleTest's compile-time switches. For instance:

- Exception support is detected via compiler-specific macros.
- Regular expression support prefers RE2 (when Abseil is enabled), falls back to POSIX, or to an internal simple regex otherwise.
- Thread safety (`GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE`) depends on mutex and thread-local storage facility availability.

---

## 5. Synchronization Primitives

GoogleTest provides lightweight abstractions over OS threading constructs, including:

- `Mutex` and `MutexLock`: Mutex implementations differ based on platform and available threading libraries (Windows critical sections, pthread mutexes, or dummy no-op implementations on non-threaded platforms).
- `ThreadLocal<T>`: Thread-local storage abstraction, implemented on Windows, pthreads, or fallbacks accordingly.
- `ThreadWithParam<T>` and `Notification`: Testing primitives to create controlled threads for internal GoogleTest tests.

These abstractions enable GoogleTest's internal thread safety while hiding platform differences.

---

## 6. Portable POSIX Wrappers

Inside the namespace `testing::internal::posix`, GoogleTest hides differences in system calls and C library APIs between OSes.

Key wrappers include:

- File system (`Stat()`, `RmDir()`, `IsDir()`)
- File descriptor functions (`FileNo(FILE*)`)
- I/O functions (`Read()`, `Write()`, `Close()`)
- Environment functions (`GetEnv()`, `StrError()`)
- Case-insensitive string comparison wrappers (`StrCaseCmp()`, `_stricmp()`)
- Terminal detection (`IsATTY()`)

These wrappers allow GoogleTest code to use consistent API calls across all platforms.

---

## 7. Utility Macros and Functions

- Macros to disable specific MSVC compiler warnings temporarily.
- Macro `GTEST_AMBIGUOUS_ELSE_BLOCKER_` to work around compiler warnings about ambiguous else bindings.
- Macros handling compiler attributes: e.g., `GTEST_ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF_` to annotate `printf`-style functions.
- Functions supporting safe casting (`ImplicitCast_`, `CheckedDowncastToActualType`) with optional RTTI enforcement.

---

## 8. Logging and Failure Reporting

GoogleTest integrates a logging facility specific to GoogleMock (and shared with GoogleTest internals). Main elements:

- `GTestLogSeverity` enum: defines log levels - info, warning, error, fatal.
- `GTestLog` class: streams logs to standard error and, for fatal logs, triggers abnormal termination.
- `GTEST_LOG_(severity)` macro simplifies logging calls.
- `LogIsVisible()` and `Log()` functions handle verbosity levels and output control based on runtime flags.

Failure reporting occurs via `FailureReporterInterface` with default GoogleTest-compatible implementation.

---

## 9. Regular Expression Support

GoogleTest abstracts regular expression usage to work on multiple platforms:

- When built with Abseil and RE2 library, uses `RE2` with a wrapper class `RE`.
- Otherwise, uses POSIX Extended regex via `<regex.h>` if available.
- Otherwise, falls back to an internal minimal regex implementation.

The class `RE` provides methods `FullMatch()` and `PartialMatch()` for matching.

---

## 10. Command-Line and Environment Utilities

These utilities aid in handling command-line arguments and environment variables, including:

- `GetArgvs()`: retrieves the command-line arguments vector.
- Functions to parse environment variables as booleans, integers, and strings, e.g., `BoolFromGTestEnv()`, `Int32FromGTestEnv()`.

Also includes `GetInjectableArgvs()` related to death tests.

---

## 11. Character and String Utilities

Functions provided for safe and consistent character classification and transformation:

- `IsAlpha()`, `IsDigit()`, `IsSpace()`, `IsXDigit()`, etc., ensuring unsigned/EOF-safe usage.
- Conversions: `ToLower()`, `ToUpper()`.
- `StripTrailingSpaces()`: removes trailing whitespace from strings.

---

## 12. Constants and Typedefs

- Defines a large enough integer type `BiggestInt` and its maximum `kMaxBiggestInt`.
- Compile-time type mapping via template `TypeWithSize` to map integer sizes to specific integer types.
- Time in milliseconds typedef as `TimeInMillis`.

---

## 13. Version and Compiler Checks

- Requires C++17 or higher.
- Detects compiler capabilities, such as inclusion of `<version>` and support for `__has_include`, `__has_attribute`, `__has_cpp_attribute`, and `__has_feature`.
- Conditional includes and macros provide compatibility for MSVC, GCC, Clang compilers.

---

## 14. Useful Practices and Notes

- GoogleTest warns that internal symbols may change without notice.
- Macros in this file are always defined to 0 or 1 to enable easier #if branches.
- Use of inline functions and templates promote cross-platform usability and efficiency.

### Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Do not use internal macros or facilities directly in tests or production code.** They are subject to change without notice.
- When porting GoogleTest to new environments, customize macros in `custom/gtest-port.h` as needed.
- Use public GoogleTest APIs for writing tests; rely on this layer only for integration or extensions.
- To control logging verbosity related to gMock, use the `--gmock_verbose` flag.
- For thread-safety in your tests or adaptations, rely on GoogleTest's synchronization primitives.

---

### Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

- If GoogleTest suspects no threading support, multi-threaded tests may become unsafe.
- Platform detection may be imperfect; overriding environment macros via build scripts may be necessary.
- Streaming and string-handling quirks on certain platforms are addressed internally but watch for locale issues.
