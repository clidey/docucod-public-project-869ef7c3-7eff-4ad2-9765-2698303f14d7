# Internal Utilities Reference

This reference provides a technical overview of the internal support utilities used within GoogleMock, including type traits, pointer helpers, error reporting, and synchronization primitives. These utilities facilitate advanced customization, porting to various platforms, and the implementation of mocking features. This documentation is intended primarily for users who contribute to or extend GoogleMock internals.

---

## 1. Environment and Platform Abstractions

GoogleMock supports a wide variety of platforms and compilers. It automatically detects environment properties and adapts accordingly, but also provides macros for user overrides during build configuration.

- **Environment-describing macros** control features like exception support, threading, regular expression availability, RTTI, wide string support, and file system presence.
- **Platform macros** define platform-specific flags such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and various BSD variants.

These macros allow GoogleMock internals to write portable, environment-aware code.

---

## 2. Synchronization Primitives

GoogleMock provides platform-agnostic synchronization primitives to support multithreading within mocks.

### Mutex and Locking

- `Mutex` class
  - On Windows: wraps native `CRITICAL_SECTION` objects.
  - On POSIX: wraps `pthread_mutex_t`.
  - On non-thread-safe platforms: no-op implementations.

- `MutexLock` (aka `GTestMutexLock`) acquires the mutex on construction and releases it on destruction, enabling RAII-style locking.

### Thread Local Storage

- Implements thread-local data storage for various platforms, either using native thread locals, pthread keys, or fallback dummy implementations.
- Template class `ThreadLocal<T>` provides per-thread storage of values of type `T` with either default or user-supplied initial values.

### Thread Helpers for Tests

- Classes like `ThreadWithParam<T>` enable test code to launch threads that run user-supplied functions with parameters.

- `Notification` class allows thread synchronization through notifications — useful for controlling test thread execution.

---

## 3. Character and String Utilities

Utilities to safely operate on characters and strings in a cross-platform way:

- Functions like `IsAlpha()`, `IsDigit()`, `IsSpace()`, `IsUpper()`, and `IsXDigit()` operate on `char` (and other char types) safely by casting to `unsigned char` to avoid undefined behaviour.
- `ToLower()` and `ToUpper()` convert a single character while respecting unsigned casting for portability.
- `StripTrailingSpaces(std::string)` trims trailing whitespace characters.

---

## 4. POSIX Wrappers and File Utilities

To facilitate portability, GoogleMock wraps common POSIX and platform-specific functions within the `testing::internal::posix` namespace:

- File and directory operations: `Stat()`, `RmDir()`, `IsDir()`, `FileNo()`
- Stream operations: `FOpen()`, `FReopen()`, `FDOpen()`, `FClose()`, with Windows Unicode support
- I/O operations: `Read()`, `Write()`, `Close()`
- Environment access: `GetEnv()` with embedded systems awareness
- Terminal detection: `IsATTY(fd)` checks if a file descriptor corresponds to a terminal
- Error descriptions: `StrError()` returns platform-specific error strings

This abstraction layer handles differences like Windows vs. POSIX APIs and the absence of some functions in embedded environments.

---

## 5. Logging and Assertions

GoogleMock defines internal logging utilities which integrate with GoogleTest's failure reporting:

- `GTestLog` provides severity-based logging (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`) that streams messages and aborts the program on fatal errors.
- Macros like `GTEST_LOG_`, `GTEST_CHECK_`, and `GTEST_CHECK_POSIX_SUCCESS_` enforce runtime conditions and report failures with clear diagnostic messages.
- These utilities wrap underlying platform-specific behaviors while delivering consistent output and failure handling in tests.

---

## 6. Type Traits and Casting Utilities

GoogleMock provides internal templates and classes to support compile-time type introspection and safe casting:

- `ConstRef<T>` transforms any type `T` to an appropriate const reference type, respecting existing reference qualifiers to enable passing by `const T&`.
- `ImplicitCast_<To>(from)` is a safe, explicit cast used for upcasting in type hierarchies, ensuring compiler-checked conversions.
- `CheckedDowncastToActualType<Derived, Base>(Base* base)` performs a downcast with a runtime check (if RTTI is enabled) to verify that the pointer being cast points to the expected derived type.

These utilities ensure type safety and correctness in template and mocking implementations.

---

## 7. Regular Expressions Interface

GoogleMock selects among several regex implementations depending on available libraries and platform:

- If built with Abseil (`GTEST_HAS_ABSL`), it uses RE2.
- If POSIX regex is available, it uses Extended POSIX regex via `<regex.h>`.
- Otherwise, it falls back to a simple internal regex implementation.

A wrapper class `RE` abstracts the interface. It supports construction from strings and offers static methods `FullMatch()` and `PartialMatch()` to check if a regex matches the entire string or any substring.

---

## 8. File Reading Utilities

- `GetFileSize(FILE*)` returns the size of a file stream.
- `ReadEntireFile(FILE*)` returns the full content of a file as a string.
- These are useful for internal operations involving death tests and file-based fixtures.

---

## 9. Command Line and Environment Variable Utilities

- Functions to access command line arguments (`GetArgvs()`) and inject arguments during death tests.
- Environment variable access helpers (`BoolFromGTestEnv()`, `Int32FromGTestEnv()`, `StringFromGTestEnv()`) parse environment variables corresponding to GoogleTest flags with default fallbacks.

---

## 10. Thread Counting and Utilities

- `GetThreadCount()` returns the number of threads running in the process when detectable; otherwise, returns 0.

- Various macros define the platform-specific path separator (`GTEST_PATH_SEP_`) and alternate path separator availability (`GTEST_HAS_ALT_PATH_SEP_`).

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Platform Compatibility**: Use the provided macros to write portability-aware code.
- **Thread Safety**: Leverage `Mutex` and `MutexLock` classes for synchronization.
- **Thread Local Storage**: Use `ThreadLocal<T>` for thread-specific data to isolate state per thread safely.
- **Logging and Failures**: Use `GTEST_LOG_` and `GTEST_CHECK_` macros internally to enforce invariants and report clear errors.
- **Safe Casting**: Prefer `CheckedDowncastToActualType` when downcasting pointers in internal code.
- **Regex Usage**: Use `testing::internal::RE` when matching strings, relying on the platform-optimized backend.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Misconfigured macros may cause inconsistent behavior; verify the platform feature macros are correctly set during build.
- On platforms with no threading support, `Mutex` and `ThreadLocal` operations are no-ops; ensure tests or custom extensions respect this.
- File system operations might be unavailable on embedded platforms, causing tests relying on files to fail.
- Logging at `FATAL` severity will terminate the program immediately.

For users extending GoogleMock internals or contributing patches, understanding these utilities is essential to maintain portability, thread-safety, and consistent functionality across supported platforms.
