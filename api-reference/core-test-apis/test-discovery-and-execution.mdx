# Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest streamlines your testing process by automatically discovering and executing tests you write in your code. This page details how GoogleTest discovers tests, handles initialization, command-line flag processing, programmatic test invocation, and provides examples of test listing, selection, and output formats.

---

## 1. Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest discovers tests through the use of registration macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()`. When your test binary runs, all defined tests are automatically registered with GoogleTest's internal test registry before execution begins.

### How Does Discovery Work?
- Each test declared with GoogleTest macros registers itself into the global registry at static initialization time.
- Tests are organized into test suites (or test cases), which group logically related tests.
- This registration allows GoogleTest to enumerate and run tests without any explicit user registration.


## 2. Test Initialization

Before tests run, GoogleTest performs several initialization steps that you can use or rely on implicitly:

- Parsing command-line arguments that control test discovery, filtering, execution order, and output formatting.
- Preparing internal data structures for managing tests.

Initialization is triggered by a call to `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);`. This is essential to enable GoogleTest to recognize its flags and setup the testing environment properly.

### Example: Basic Initialization
```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

## 3. Command-Line Flags and Test Control

GoogleTest provides a rich set of command-line flags that let you control which tests to run, how to run them, and the output format.

### Common Flags
- `--gtest_list_tests`: Lists all discovered tests without running them.
- `--gtest_filter=<filter>`: Runs only tests matching the filter pattern.
- `--gtest_repeat=<n>`: Runs tests repeatedly `n` times.
- `--gtest_output=<format>:<path>`: Outputs results in XML format, e.g., `xml:report.xml`.

### Usage Example
```bash
./my_tests --gtest_list_tests
./my_tests --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*
./my_tests --gtest_repeat=10
./my_tests --gtest_output=xml:report.xml
```

### Tips
- Filters support wildcards (`*` matches any substring).
- Combining filters allows you to run subsets of tests, such as only integration or unit tests.

## 4. Running Tests Programmatically

Beyond `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest allows more explicit control over test execution via its API:

### Key APIs
- `testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()`: Get the singleton test registry.
- `UnitTest::Run()`: Run all registered tests and return the result code.
- Iterating through `TestCase` and `TestInfo` objects to inspect available tests.

### Typical Flow
1. Initialize with `InitGoogleTest`.
2. Optionally list or inspect tests programmatically.
3. Call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` or `UnitTest::Run()`.

### Example: Listing Tests Programmatically
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  const testing::UnitTest& unit_test = *testing::UnitTest::GetInstance();

  for (int i = 0; i < unit_test.total_test_case_count(); ++i) {
    const testing::TestCase& test_case = *unit_test.GetTestCase(i);
    std::cout << test_case.name() << std::endl;

    for (int j = 0; j < test_case.total_test_count(); ++j) {
      const testing::TestInfo& test_info = *test_case.GetTestInfo(j);
      std::cout << "  " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## 5. Test Output Formats

GoogleTest supports various output formats to integrate with external tools:

- **Console Output (default):** Human-readable with colors and concise messages.
- **XML:** Structured XML file compatible with popular CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, TeamCity).

### Example of XML Output
Running with `--gtest_output=xml:results.xml` produces an XML file documenting test results, failures, and timings.

### Result Statuses
Tests report one of the following statuses:
- **PASSED**: The test succeeded.
- **FAILED**: The test failed any assertion.
- **SKIPPED**: The test was skipped.

The final result reported by `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` reflects the overall success or failure of the tests executed.

## 6. Practical User Flows

### Running All Tests
1. Write your tests using `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros.
2. Compile the test binary.
3. Run it without arguments to run all discovered tests.

### Running Specific Tests
1. Use the `--gtest_filter=` flag to specify which tests to run by name.
2. Use wildcards (`*`) to match multiple tests.
3. Use `--gtest_list_tests` to enumerate available tests.

### Listing Tests
Simply run:
```shell
./my_test_binary --gtest_list_tests
```
Output will look like:
```
MyTestSuite.
  Test1
  Test2
AnotherSuite.
  TestA
```

### Filtering Tests
To run only tests from `MyTestSuite` starting with `Test1`:
```shell
./my_test_binary --gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.Test1*
```

## 7. Initialization and Main Function Integration

GoogleMock includes a provided main function that initializes both GoogleMock and GoogleTest and runs all tests. This main function is typically linked in from `gmock_main`:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

If you need custom initialization, you can write your own main and call `InitGoogleTest()` or `InitGoogleMock()`. Note that `InitGoogleMock` also initializes GoogleTest automatically.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Tests Not Discovered?
- Ensure you've linked against GoogleTest and initialized the framework via `InitGoogleTest()`.
- Confirm tests are registered using the GoogleTest macros.

### Command-line Flags Not Working?
- Pass `&argc` and `argv` from your main to `InitGoogleTest` to properly initialize.
- Make sure flags come before positional arguments.

### Unexpected Tests Running or Filtering Issues?
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to inspect what tests GoogleTest has discovered.
- Review your filter expressions for correctness.

## 9. Summary

GoogleTest's automatic test discovery and execution simplify running and managing C++ tests. Through initialization, rich command-line control, and flexible programmatic APIs, it empowers you to write expressive tests that integrate easily with CI pipelines and development workflows.
