# Portability & Platform Utilities

This documentation provides a detailed reference for the low-level portability and utility macros integral to GoogleTest and GoogleMock. These macros and utilities enable seamless platform detection, feature toggling, and path manipulation, which are essential for building and running tests consistently across diverse environments including Linux, Windows, macOS, and other supported platforms.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock rely heavily on a set of platform utilities to adapt their behavior depending on the compilation environment and runtime platform. These utilities provide:

- **Platform Detection:** Compile-time macros that identify the operating system and compiler features available.
- **Feature Toggles:** Macros that indicate availability of features such as exceptions, pthreads, RTTI, and stream redirection.
- **Path Manipulation:** Definitions for platform-specific path separators and utilities supporting file system operations.

Together, these facilities underpin the ability of the framework to function robustly and uniformly across a wide variety of platforms.

This page focuses exclusively on those portability macros and utilities, exposing the macros and their purposes so that advanced users can understand test portability and debugging issues that arise due to environmental differences.

## Platform Detection Macros

GoogleTest defines a comprehensive set of macros to detect the target operating system and platform characteristics at compile time. These are centrally declared and used throughout the codebase to switch implementations as needed.

### Common Platform Macros

| Macro                 | Description                          | Typical Values                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`      | Defined if the platform is any flavor of Windows (desktop, mobile) | 1
| `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_DESKTOP` | Windows desktop edition         | 1
| `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS_MINGW` | MinGW environment on Windows     | 1
| `GTEST_OS_LINUX`         | Any Linux-based platform           | 1
| `GTEST_OS_MAC`           | Apple macOS                      | 1
| `GTEST_OS_IOS`           | Apple iOS device                  | 1
| `GTEST_OS_FREEBSD`       | FreeBSD Unix-like OS              | 1
| `GTEST_OS_OPENBSD`       | OpenBSD Unix-like OS              | 1
| `GTEST_OS_SOLARIS`       | Sun Solaris                      | 1
| `GTEST_OS_FUCHSIA`       | Fuchsia OS                      | 1
|

These macros are mutually exclusive and automatically defined by the included internal header `gtest-port-arch.h` based on predefined compiler-target macros.

Users should use these macros to conditionally compile platform-specific code or debug environmental differences.


---

## Feature Availability Macros

GoogleTest declares macros indicating whether certain features are enabled or available on the build platform. These toggle conditional compilation and runtime behaviors.

| Macro                      | Meaning                                           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`       | Set to 1 if C++ exceptions are enabled             |
| `GTEST_HAS_RTTI`             | Set to 1 if Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) is enabled |
| `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`          | Set to 1 if POSIX threads are available             |
| `GTEST_HAS_FILE_SYSTEM`      | Set to 1 if filesystem functions are supported     |
| `GTEST_HAS_STREAM_REDIRECTION` | Set to 1 if stdout and stderr stream redirection is supported |
| `GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST`       | Set to 1 if death tests are supported               |
| `GTEST_HAS_TYPED_TEST`       | Set to 1 if typed tests are supported               |

These values are automatically inferred where possible but can be overridden by defining them explicitly.

## Path and File Utilities

GoogleTest provides platform-appropriate definitions for path separators and basic filesystem operations to enable portable file handling.

| Macro / Function             | Description                                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `GTEST_PATH_SEP_`             | The character used as the path separator (e.g., `"/"` on *nix, `"\\"` on Windows) |
| `GTEST_HAS_ALT_PATH_SEP_`     | Whether an alternate path separator is supported (Windows supports both `/` and `\\`) |

GoogleTest internal functions and wrappers handle platform-specific behavior such as case-insensitive string comparisons (`StrCaseCmp`), checking for directory presence on file details, and environment variable handling via `GetEnv`.

### File IO Wrappers

- `FOpen()`, `FReopen()` — Open and reopen files, with adjustments on Windows to support wide path names.
- `Read()`, `Write()`, `Close()` — Low-level file descriptor operations adapted per-platform.
- `ChDir()` — Change directory support where available.

These ensure consistent behavior of test code that touches file I/O.

## Character Utilities

To handle character classification safely and consistently, GoogleTest wraps standard C library functions such as `isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `isspace()`, casting their inputs to `unsigned char` to avoid undefined behavior when given signed chars.

Example utilities:

- `IsAlpha(char ch)`
- `IsDigit(char ch)`
- `IsSpace(char ch)`
- `IsXDigit(char ch)`

These utilities also support wide character variants and guarantee consistent classification across platforms.


---

## Synchronization Primitives

GoogleTest’s internal portability layer provides synchronization abstractions compatible with the host platform.

### Mutex

- On Windows, implemented using native Win32 critical sections.
- On POSIX platforms, wraps `pthread_mutex_t`.
- On single-threaded or unsupported platforms, a dummy mutex is provided.

### MutexLock

- RAII class acquiring and releasing the associated Mutex.

### ThreadLocal Storage

- `ThreadLocal<T>` class provides thread-local variable storage using native TLS primitives.
- Supports default construction, value initialization, and explicit set/get methods.
- Guarded by macros to provide the most appropriate platform-specific implementation.

### ThreadWithParam

- Helper class to spawn and join a thread with a parameter, mainly for internal GoogleTest threading tests and utilities.


---

## Regular Expression Wrappers

GoogleTest abstracts regular expression support via the `RE` class template that chooses the best available implementation at compile time:

- Uses Abseil’s RE2 on platforms compiled with Abseil support.
- Uses POSIX Extended regex on UNIX-like platforms.
- Falls back to a simplified internal regex engine otherwise.

This design allows test code to be regular expression capable portably with minimal performance or feature regressions.


---

## Logging and Error Checking

GoogleTest provides internal macros to consistently log messages with severity levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`) and to fail fast if an invariant or operation fails.

- `GTEST_LOG_(severity)` streams log messages.
- `GTEST_CHECK_(condition)` checks a condition and aborts with log on false.
- `GTEST_CHECK_POSIX_SUCCESS_(call)` validates the return code of POSIX calls.

These semantics ensure test infrastructure diagnostics are reliable and uniform.


---

## Flags Support

GoogleMock and GoogleTest share a mechanism for defining and declaring command-line flags, abstracting between internal Abseil flag support and internal static variables.

For example:

```cpp
#define GMOCK_DEFINE_bool_(name, default_val, doc) ...
#define GMOCK_DECLARE_bool_(name) ...
#define GMOCK_FLAG_GET(name) ...
#define GMOCK_FLAG_SET(name, value) ...
```

Users can leverage these flag macros for specialized configuration where needed.


---

## Example: Platform-Dependent Behavior

The portability utilities underpin behavior such as thread counting, file descriptor manipulation, and path formatting.

For instance, the macro `GTEST_PATH_SEP_` can be dynamically used to write cross-platform file paths:

```cpp
std::string temp_dir = std::string("/tmp") + GTEST_PATH_SEP_ + "mytest";
```

Similarly, thread local variables instantiated via `ThreadLocal<MyType>` function properly regardless of Windows or POSIX implementations.


---

## Troubleshooting Common Portability Issues

If you observe incorrect behavior or compilation failures related to platform specifics:

- Confirm that the platform detection macros match your environment.
- Ensure that exceptions and RTTI support macros reflect your compiler configuration.
- Review any path or filesystem calls for cross-platform correctness respecting `GTEST_PATH_SEP_` and wide path handling.
- Verify thread and synchronization support availability especially if tests rely on multi-threading.

Most issues arise from inconsistent compiler flags or incomplete environment definitions.
