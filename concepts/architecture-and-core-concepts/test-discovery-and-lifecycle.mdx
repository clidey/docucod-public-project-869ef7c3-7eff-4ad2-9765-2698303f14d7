# Test Discovery and Lifecycle

GoogleTest provides a robust and intuitive framework for discovering, registering, and executing C++ tests. This document explains how GoogleTest manages the lifecycle of tests—including test registration, execution flow, and result reporting—while introducing the core abstractions of test suites, test cases, and fixtures that underpin the testing process.

---

## Overview: The Test Lifecycle

From the moment you write a test using macros like `TEST` or `TEST_F`, GoogleTest takes over the responsibility of registering it, orchestrating its execution, and collecting detailed results. Here’s a bird's-eye view of the lifecycle:

1. **Test Registration:** Test and test fixtures register themselves automatically during program initialization.
2. **Initialization:** GoogleTest parses command-line flags and environment variables to configure test execution.
3. **Test Execution:** Tests are invoked in a defined order, with setup and teardown hooks called as applicable.
4. **Result Collection:** Results, including successes, failures, skips, and properties, are collected and aggregated.
5. **Reporting and Cleanup:** Summary outputs are generated, and global tear-down is performed.

This structure allows you to focus on writing test logic while GoogleTest handles execution details.

## Key Abstractions in GoogleTest

Understanding the key abstractions helps you navigate and extend the framework effectively.

### Test

All tests derive from the abstract class `testing::Test`. When you use the `TEST` macro, GoogleTest automatically manages creating a test fixture for you. For more complex setups involving shared state, you derive your own fixture class from `testing::Test` and use `TEST_F`.

Key features include:

- **SetUpTestSuite() / TearDownTestSuite():** Static methods called once per test suite to initialize and clean up shared resources.
- **SetUp() / TearDown():** Called before and after each individual test for custom per-test setup and teardown.
- **Isolation:** Each test runs in a fresh fixture instance, ensuring test independence.
- **Assertions:** Tests contain assertions that determine pass/fail outcomes.

Example test fixture declaration:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Per-test setup code
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Per-test teardown code
  }

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Shared resource setup
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Shared resource teardown
  }

  // Shared or per-test members
};

TEST_F(FooTest, DoesSomething) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(...);
}
```

### TestInfo

`TestInfo` encapsulates metadata about each test:

- Test suite name
- Test name
- Parameterization info (for typed or value-parameterized tests)
- Source file and line number
- Execution result including passes, failures, skips, and messages

Users can access the current test’s `TestInfo` during test execution, for example:

```cpp
const testing::TestInfo* test_info =
    testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->current_test_info();
printf("Running test: %s.%s\n", test_info->test_suite_name(), test_info->name());
```

---

### TestSuite

A `TestSuite` is a collection of related tests, typically grouped by the test fixture class or a logical grouping indicating the code area under test.

`TestSuite` aggregates:

- The list of `TestInfo` objects it contains
- Per-suite setup and teardown states
- Execution stats (number of passed, failed, skipped tests)
- Timing information

GoogleTest calls `SetUpTestSuite()` once before the first test in the suite and `TearDownTestSuite()` once after the last test.

---

### UnitTest

The `UnitTest` singleton represents the entire test program. It manages:

- All `TestSuite`s
- Global environments and listeners
- Reporting overall success or failure
- Running all tests when `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called

You rarely interact directly with `UnitTest` except to query runtime information or modify listeners.

---

## Test Registration Flow

GoogleTest uses static registration to automatically register all tests before `main` runs.

- Macros like `TEST` and `TEST_F` generate code that constructs a `TestInfo` object.
- The `TestInfo` gets registered with `UnitTest`, which stores it under the appropriate `TestSuite`.
- This process requires no explicit calls from the user; tests simply become available for running.

For programs that dynamically generate tests or require more control, GoogleTest provides `RegisterTest`, an advanced API to manually register tests during runtime.

---

## Running Tests and Execution Flow

Once initialized, executing all tests involves:

1. Calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which accesses `UnitTest::GetInstance()`.
2. For each registered `TestSuite`:
   - Runs `SetUpTestSuite()`.
   - Runs each `TestInfo`:
     - Creates a fresh `Test` fixture instance.
     - Calls the instance's `SetUp()`.
     - Invokes the test's `TestBody()` where assertions execute.
     - Calls `TearDown()`.
     - Deletes the fixture object.
   - Runs `TearDownTestSuite()`.

Tests run sequentially but may be run in randomized or filtered order depending on command-line flags.

Failures are tracked, but tests continue executing unless the `fail_fast` flag is set.

---

## Flags Influencing Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest offers a rich set of command-line flags and environment variables to customize test runs:

| Flag                          | Description                                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter`              | Run a subset of tests matching specific patterns    |
| `--gtest_list_tests`          | List all registered tests without running them      |
| `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` | Include disabled tests in the run                |
| `--gtest_repeat`              | Repeat tests a set number of times                   |
| `--gtest_shuffle`             | Randomize test execution order                       |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`    | Stop execution and break into debugger on failure   |
| `--gtest_output`              | Generate XML or JSON reports                         |

Recognizing and using these effectively allows efficient test execution tailored to your needs.

---

## Result Reporting and Properties

Tests can log additional information via `RecordProperty()`. These key/value pairs are captured alongside test results and emitted in output formats such as XML.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyTest, LogsProperties) {
  testing::Test::RecordProperty("ResourceUsage", "High");
  EXPECT_TRUE(DoSomething());
}
```

Test outcomes are categorized as:

- **Passed:** No fatal or nonfatal failures
- **Failed:** At least one fatal or nonfatal failure
- **Skipped:** Test was skipped explicitly or due to `GTEST_SKIP()`

Results are accessible programmatically through `TestResult` and related classes.

---

## Skipping and Disabling Tests

GoogleTest supports test skipping and temporary disabling:

- Prefix a test or suite with `DISABLED_` to exclude it from runs.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` inside tests or fixtures to skip execution at runtime.

You can opt to include disabled tests by running with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Avoid underscores (_)** in test suite and test names to prevent naming clashes.
- **Use fixtures (`TEST_F`)** when multiple tests share setup/teardown.
- Make use of **`SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`** to share expensive resources.
- Use **filters and sharding** for selective or parallel test runs.
- Leverage **`RecordProperty()`** to log contextual info for diagnostic XML or JSON reports.
- Avoid writing tests that depend on execution order — GoogleTest intentionally randomizes order by default.
- Use **`GTEST_SKIP()`** judiciously to manage runtime skip conditions.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Test not discovered?** Ensure you have included `<gtest/gtest.h>` and are using `TEST` / `TEST_F` macros properly.
- **`SetUp()` not called?** Check that you spelled `SetUp` correctly (not `Setup`).
- **Test runs but assertions don’t fail?** Verify that your test is linked and runs in the filtered test set.
- **Running subsets of tests?** Use the `--gtest_filter` flag with care; syntax is glob-based, not regex.
- **Disabled tests not running?** Enable with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.
- **Crash on `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`?** Make sure you return its value from your `main()` function.
