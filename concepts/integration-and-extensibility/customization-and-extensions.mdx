# Customization and Extending GoogleTest

Learn how to customize assertion behaviors, define custom matchers, or adapt the test runner for unique scenarios. This page covers the extension points and best practices for tailoring GoogleTest to advanced product needs.

---

## Overview

GoogleTest is designed to be flexible and extensible. While the default behavior covers the needs of most users, advanced scenarios often require customization to better fit unique testing workflows, reporting formats, or domain-specific validation logic.

This guide focuses on how to extend and customize GoogleTest, from creating custom assertions and matchers to adapting the test runner behavior and managing mocking behaviors.

---

## Defining Custom Assertions

In addition to built-in assertions, GoogleTest enables you to create powerful, domain-specific custom assertions. These assertions integrate seamlessly with test results and failure messages, improving the clarity and usefulness of error reports.

### Writing Predicate-Format Assertions

The foundation of custom assertions is the predicate-format assertion, which uses the `testing::AssertionResult` type to represent success or failure with descriptive messages.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Predicate function example
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(CustomAssertionTest, Basic) {
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, 4);  // Passes
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, 3);  // Fails with message "3 is odd"
}
```

### Creating Assertion Macros

For convenience and readability, wrap predicates in assertion macros:

```cpp
#define EXPECT_IS_EVEN(val) EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, val)
#define ASSERT_IS_EVEN(val) ASSERT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, val)
```

### Best Practices

- Ensure custom assertions provide clear failure messages.
- Use them consistently to improve test diagnostics.
- Keep predicate functions free of side effects.

---

## Writing Custom Matchers

Matchers specify constraints on mock function arguments and assertion values. Defining custom matchers allows you to encode domain logic, improving expressiveness and reusability.

### Using the `MATCHER` Macros

GoogleTest simplifies defining matchers through macros:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}
```

This defines a polymorphic matcher usable in expectations:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsDivisibleBy7()));
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy7());
```

### Parameterized Matchers

For matchers requiring parameters, use `MATCHER_P` and variants:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsMultipleOf, factor, "") {
  return (arg % factor) == 0;
}
```

Example usage:

```cpp
EXPECT_THAT(21, IsMultipleOf(7));
```

### Advanced Matcher Classes

For cases needing more control, define matcher classes implementing:

- `bool MatchAndExplain(const T& value, std::ostream* os) const`
- `void DescribeTo(std::ostream* os) const`
- `void DescribeNegationTo(std::ostream* os) const`

Then wrap in a factory function returning `testing::Matcher<T>`.

### Composite Matchers

Custom matchers can compose existing matchers for flexible constraints.

## Adapting the Test Runner

GoogleTest provides entry points and APIs to customize test execution.

### Writing a Custom `main()`

By default, GoogleTest supplies a `main()` function. To adapt startup, teardown, logging, or environment setup:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  // Custom initialization
  int result = RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  // Custom cleanup
  return result;
}
```

### Tuning Test Discovery and Filtering

Use command-line flags or API calls to filter which tests run.

### Integrating with External Systems

Leverage GoogleTest APIs to hook into your own test frameworks or reporting pipelines.

## Customizing Mock Behavior

GoogleMock supports several built-in behaviors to manage uninteresting calls and their strictness.

### NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock

These wrappers control the behavior of mock objects when they receive calls without explicit expectations:

- `NiceMock<T>`: suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock<T>`: emits warnings on uninteresting calls (default behavior).
- `StrictMock<T>`: treats uninteresting calls as errors.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockClass> mock;  // Ignores uninteresting call warnings
```

Use these wrappers to tailor test verbosity and enforcement level.

### Constructing Wrapped Mocks

These wrappers inherit constructors from the wrapped mock class, supporting construction with parameters:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockClass> mock(param1, param2);
```

### Important Caveats

- Only works for mock methods defined directly in the mock class with `MOCK_METHOD`.
- Nesting wrappers (e.g., `NiceMock<StrictMock<MockClass>>`) is unsupported.
- The mock class must have a virtual destructor for correct behavior.

---

## Best Practices for Extensions

- Prefer to extend through documented public APIs.
- Avoid modifying internal implementation details.
- Write pure functions/matchers/assertions free of side effects.
- Use custom matchers and assertions to promote readable tests.
- Control mock strictness thoughtfully to balance maintenance and bug detection.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Extension Issues

- If custom assertions or matchers don't report as expected, verify that their descriptions are clear and `MatchAndExplain()` is correctly implemented.
- Unexplained test failures on mocks may be due to unexpected or uninteresting calls; use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` as needed.
- When overriding test runner behavior, ensure `InitGoogleTest()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` are called correctly.

## Example: Creating and Using a Custom Matcher

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsWithinRange, range, "Checks if value is within +/- range") {
  return (arg >= -range) && (arg <= range);
}

TEST(MyTest, UsesCustomMatcher) {
  EXPECT_THAT(5, IsWithinRange(10));  // Passes
  EXPECT_THAT(15, IsWithinRange(10));  // Fails
}
```

## Example: Using NiceMock for Ignoring Uninteresting Calls

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (int), ());
};

using ::testing::NiceMock;

TEST(SuppressesWarnings, UsingNiceMock) {
  NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;
  // No warnings printed even if Bar() is called without an expectation
  mock_foo.Bar(5);
}
```
