# Integration with Build and External Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed for seamless integration into various C++ build environments and external testing systems, enabling efficient test construction, execution, and reporting at scale. This guide explores typical integration patterns, focusing on popular build tools like CMake and Bazel, handling test binary entry points, dependency coordination, and approaches for running and managing tests within complex projects.

---

## 1. Integrating with C++ Build Systems

### 1.1 CMake Integration

CMake is widely used to build C++ projects, and GoogleTest/GoogleMock are compatible with it out of the box.

#### Setting Up
- Include GoogleTest as an external project or a subdirectory.
- Use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` or add `add_subdirectory(googletest)` if cloning it locally.
- Link test targets with `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gmock`.

#### Organizing Tests
- Place tests in dedicated directories or alongside code.
- Create executable targets for test binaries using `add_executable`.
- Link test binaries against GoogleTest and GoogleMock libraries.

#### Example CMakeLists.txt Snippet
```cmake
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_test test_example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test PRIVATE GTest::gtest GTest::gmock pthread)
add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND my_test)
```

#### Build Considerations
- Ensure all source and test files comply with C++17 or above as required.
- Consistent compiler and linker settings across your project and GoogleTest/GoogleMock to avoid mismatches.

#### Running Tests
- Use `ctest` or run test executables directly.
- Pass appropriate flags such as `--gmock_verbose` or test filters.

### 1.2 Bazel Integration

Bazel users benefit from direct workspace support for GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

#### Workspace Setup
- Declare dependencies using `MODULE.bazel` or `WORKSPACE` to include GoogleTest.

#### BUILD File Example
```python
cc_test(
    name = "my_test",
    srcs = ["my_test.cc"],
    deps = ["@com_google_googletest//:gmock_main"],
)
```

#### Running Bazel Tests
- Execute tests with `bazel test //path/to:my_test`.
- Use Bazel test flags for filtering and test environment setup.

#### Notes
- Bazel build rules handle linking and dependencies, easing configuration.
- Ensure version compatibility of Bazel rules and GoogleTest.

### 1.3 Coordinating with Project Dependencies

- Ensure GoogleTest and GoogleMock are linked only once to avoid linker conflicts.
- Isolate test dependencies from production code dependencies where possible.
- Use interface libraries or dedicated test targets.
- Adopt consistent compiler flags, especially around RTTI, exceptions, and threading.

## 2. Test Binary Entry Points and Initialization

### 2.1 Standard Entry Point

GoogleTest and GoogleMock use a unified initialization and test execution entry point:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- `InitGoogleMock` initializes both testing and mocking subsystems.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS` discovers and executes all registered tests and mocks.

### 2.2 Automatic Test Discovery

Tests are automatically discovered by registering test cases during static initialization, removing the need for manual registration.

### 2.3 Command Line Flags

- Use `--gmock_filter` or `--gtest_filter` to select tests.
- Configure verbosity with `--gmock_verbose` for mock call reporting.
- Set environment and runtime behaviors through flags passed to the binary.

### 2.4 Custom Main Recommendation

- While GoogleTest provides a built-in main function, defining your own main lets you customize initialization, logging, or set global settings.

## 3. Strategies for Running and Reporting Tests at Scale

### 3.1 Test Binary Organization

- Group related tests into separate binaries for parallel execution and better isolation.
- Avoid monolithic test binaries to reduce runtime and improve fault localization.

### 3.2 Parallel and Sharded Test Execution

- Use build system support (e.g., CTest, Bazel's `--test_sharding_strategy`) to run tests in parallel or shards.
- Ensure tests are isolated and do not share global state to guarantee reliability.

### 3.3 Test Output and Reporting

- Use GoogleTest's XML output with flags like `--gtest_output=xml:report.xml` for integration with CI systems and dashboards.
- Integrate with external test runners and reporting tools such as TAP listeners or IDE plugins.

### 3.4 Integration with External Runners

GoogleTest supports hooks and extensions for integration with third-party test runners and IDEs:
- Visual Studio Code extensions,
- CI/CD pipelines,
- Custom listeners for advanced logging or metrics gathering.

Refer to the [Ecosystem and Tooling Integrations](/overview/workflow-integration/ecosystem-integration) page for deeper details.

## 4. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Compile Once, Link Many**: Prefer separate compilation of mocks and production code to speed up builds.
- **Explicit Initialization**: Always call `InitGoogleMock` in your test binary's main entry.
- **Match Builds**: Ensure GoogleTest and your tests are compiled with consistent compiler settings and standards.
- **Avoid Over-Constraining**: Use `ON_CALL` for default behaviors, and `EXPECT_CALL` only when verifying interactions.
- **Leak Detection**: Enable `--gmock_catch_leaked_mocks` (default `true`) to catch mocks that are not destroyed, signaling unverified tests.
- **Control Verbosity**: Adjust mock call reporting with `--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error` to suit your debugging needs.
- **Use NiceMock or StrictMock** when you want to suppress or enforce uninteresting call reporting.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

- **Linker Errors**: Usually caused by missing GoogleTest or GoogleMock libraries; check your link flags.
- **Test Discovery Failure**: Ensure all test files are included in the build and linked into the test binary.
- **Runtime Failures on Unexpected Calls**: Validate expectations are set prior to exercising the system.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Confirm your build environment matches supported compilers and platforms as per the [Supported Platforms](/overview/workflow-integration/supported-platforms) guide.
- **Header and Macro Conflicts**: When integrating with platform SDKs (Windows API), beware of macro name collisions; GoogleMock deals with this via macro-safe handling.
