# Framework Extensibility and Customization

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed not only to provide powerful testing capabilities out of the box but also to be highly customizable and extensible. This allows you to tailor testing behavior to your project's unique requirements by writing user-defined assertions and matchers, customizing test environments, and hooking into internal utilities.

This guide will help you understand these extensibility points and how to effectively leverage them to create tailored, maintainable, and expressive test solutions.

---

## Why Extend and Customize?  
As you develop tests for complex systems, you may encounter scenarios where:

- Built-in assertions or matchers do not capture domain-specific validation logic.
- You want richer failure messages to improve debugging.
- The setup or teardown for your tests requires custom global or shared environment configurations.
- You need to inject tailored behaviors or logging to integrate with your toolchains.

Customization unlocks these possibilities, enabling more precise and maintainable testing.

---

## User-Defined Assertions

Assertions are the fundamental building blocks of tests, verifying that code behaves as expected. GoogleTest supports creating your own assertions to capture validations unique to your domain.

### Writing Custom Assertions

A user-defined assertion should return a `testing::AssertionResult` indicating success or failure and optionally add descriptive messages.

Example: Checking if a number is even

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  else
    return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even";
}

TEST(NumberTest, EvenCheck) {
  int val = 3;
  EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, val);
}
```

The above assertion integrates smoothly, providing intuitive failure messages.

### Best Practices

- Always return `AssertionSuccess()` on success and `AssertionFailure()` on failure.
- Use `<<` to stream helpful diagnostic messages on failure.
- Write assertions that are pure and have no side effects.
- Prefer reusable assertions over complex inline expectations.

For deeper reference, see the GoogleTest [Assertions and Result Handling guide](../api-reference/core-testing-apis/assertions.md).

## Custom Matchers in GoogleMock

Matchers allow you to specify flexible conditions on arguments in mocks. GoogleMock enables you to write your own matchers tailored to specific data structures or domain rules.

### Defining Custom Matchers

You can easily create matchers using macros or by implementing matcher classes.

#### Using MATCHER Macros

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "Checks if a number is divisible by 7") {
  return (arg % 7) == 0;
}

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(IsDivisibleBy7()));
```

#### Implementing Matcher Classes

For advanced needs, implement the interface with methods like `MatchAndExplain`, `DescribeTo`, and `DescribeNegationTo`.

```cpp
class EvenMatcher {
 public:
  using is_gtest_matcher = void;
  bool MatchAndExplain(int n, std::ostream* os) const {
    bool is_even = (n % 2 == 0);
    if (!is_even && os) {
      *os << n << " is not even";
    }
    return is_even;
  }
  void DescribeTo(std::ostream* os) const { *os << "is even"; }
  void DescribeNegationTo(std::ostream* os) const { *os << "is odd"; }
};

::testing::Matcher<int> IsEven() {
  return ::testing::Matcher<int>(new ::testing::internal::MatcherImpl<EvenMatcher>(EvenMatcher()));
}
```

### Composing Parametrized Matchers

Use `MATCHER_P`, `MATCHER_P2`, etc., to define matchers with parameters for custom behavior.

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsMultipleOf, factor, "Checks if divisible by given factor") {
  return (arg % factor) == 0;
}
```

### Best Practices

- Write clear, concise matchers with helpful failure messages.
- Ensure matchers are side-effect free to avoid flaky tests.
- Favor simple macro matchers for common cases and class-based ones for complex logic.

Explore the [Matchers Reference](../api-reference/mocking-apis/matchers-mocking.md) and the [Mocking and Assertions concepts guide](../concepts/mocking-and-data-models/matchers-and-actions.mdx) for comprehensive insights.

## Custom Test Environments

GoogleTest allows defining custom test environments via the `testing::Environment` class. These enable you to set up and tear down state that affects multiple test suites or the entire test run.

### Creating and Using a Custom Environment

Subclass `testing::Environment` and override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods.

```cpp
class MyGlobalEnv : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize resources shared by all tests
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up shared resources
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyGlobalEnv());

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This approach ensures shared setup executes once before any tests run, and teardown happens after all tests complete.

### When to Use

- Complex or expensive resource initialization needed for all or multiple tests.
- Environment configuration like setting up databases, servers, or file systems.
- Logging or monitoring setups that span numerous tests or test suites.

### Best Practices

- Avoid test-specific setup in global environments — prefer fixture-level setups.
- Keep environments lightweight to avoid slowing down the test run.
- Use environment teardown wisely to prevent resource leaks.

See the [Testing Reference on Environment](../docs/reference/testing.md#Environment) for more details.

## Internal Utilities and Hooks

GoogleTest provides internal utility hooks to enable advanced customization, mostly intended for power users extending GoogleTest’s core behavior.

### Examples and Capabilities

- **Custom Temporary Directory:** Override `GTEST_CUSTOM_TEMPDIR_FUNCTION_` macro to specify a custom `TempDir()` implementation — useful when your tests require control over temporary file locations.
- **Custom Stack Trace Getter:** Define `GTEST_OS_STACK_TRACE_GETTER_` to supply platform-specific stack traces.
- **Custom Logging:** Redirect or extend GoogleTest’s log mechanism via `GTEST_LOG_`, `GTEST_CHECK_`, and related macros.

### How to Use

These utilities are exposed as macros you define before including GoogleTest headers or at build configuration time.

```cpp
#define GTEST_CUSTOM_TEMPDIR_FUNCTION_ MyCustomTempDir
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

const char* MyCustomTempDir() {
  return "/custom/tmp";
}
```

### Cautions

- These mechanisms interact closely with GoogleTest internals and should only be used if you have a solid understanding of the framework.
- Use these extensions to solve specific platform constraints or integration needs.

For further reading, consult the [Internal Utilities documentation](../api-reference/utilities-customization/internal-utilities.mdx).

## Practical Tips for Successful Customization

- **Start Simple:** Begin with user-defined assertions and matchers before diving into environment and utilities customizations.
- **Use the Provided APIs:** Avoid hacking or working around undocumented internals.
- **Documentation & Examples:** Leverage the official guides and cookbook that include tested recipes.
- **Testing Your Extensions:** Thoroughly unit test custom assertions, matchers, and environments.
- **Clarity & Maintenance:** Prefer expressive and clear extensions to ensure tests remain understandable.

## Summary
This page guides you how to extend and customize GoogleTest and GoogleMock:

- **User-Defined Assertions:** Create expressive, reusable custom assertions for better test clarity and diagnosability.
- **Custom Matchers:** Define flexible matchers in GoogleMock to check domain-specific argument conditions in mocks.
- **Custom Test Environments:** Manage shared setup and teardown across tests by writing your own environment classes.
- **Internal Utilities & Hooks:** Advanced customization possibilities via macros and hooks for controlling internal behaviors.

Leveraging these extensibility points enables crafting testing solutions that are deeply tailored to your project’s needs while maintaining the robustness and clarity of GoogleTest's framework.
