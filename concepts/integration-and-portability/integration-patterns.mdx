# Integration Patterns and Customization Hooks

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed not only as versatile C++ testing utilities but also as frameworks that integrate seamlessly with existing build systems, CI/CD pipelines, and custom test-reporting infrastructures. This page explains the conceptual integration patterns and entry points where you can customize and extend the framework to fit your project’s unique infrastructure needs.

## Integration with Build Systems

Most users adopt GoogleTest and GoogleMock by integrating them into their C++ build system such as CMake or Bazel. This ensures tests are compiled, linked, and executed consistently with the rest of the project.

### Key Integration Concerns

- **Compilation & Linking**: Include GoogleTest and GoogleMock headers (`#include <gtest/gtest.h>` and `#include <gmock/gmock.h>`) in your test sources and link them against the corresponding GoogleTest libraries.
- **Mock Class Definitions**: Define mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD()` macros to automatically generate mocked methods, enabling easy test mocking.
- **Test Executable Entry Points**: GoogleMock provides main functions like `gmock_main.cc` which calls `InitGoogleMock()` to initialize the framework before running tests. You can link `gmock_main` directly to simplify your test executable.

### Example Workflows

In CMake or Bazel, you can add GoogleTest and GoogleMock as dependencies and then configure your test binaries accordingly. Refer to the [Integrating with Build Systems](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/docs/guides/integration-and-best-practices/integrating-with-build-systems.md) guide for detailed instructions.

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD) Patterns

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to fit naturally in continuous integration workflows, enabling automated, repeatable test runs.

- **Parallel Test Execution**: Testing frameworks support parallel execution of multiple tests to speed up your CI pipeline.
- **Test Filtering & Sharding**: Command-line flags allow filtering which tests or groups run, supporting selective or sharded execution.
- **Reporting & Logging**: The frameworks support providing structured and readable output to integrate with reporting dashboards or CI listeners.

### Custom Test Runners and Listeners

For advanced integration, GoogleTest supports extension points where you can implement custom test event listeners. This lets you:

- Modify test result reporting format
- Forward test results to external tools or dashboards
- Implement specialized logging or metrics collection

You can leverage this to integrate with proprietary CI infrastructure or custom test runners beyond the default GoogleTest harness.

## Customization Entry Points

GoogleMock and GoogleTest provide explicit extension hooks and patterns to customize the behavior and output.

### Use of Mock Wrappers: NiceMock, NaggyMock, StrictMock

GoogleMock provides three wrapper classes to control how uninteresting calls (those without explicit expectations) behave:

- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings about uninteresting calls, allowing smoother test output when you expect such calls.
- **NaggyMock**: (Default behavior) Prints warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Fails the test on uninteresting calls, enforcing strict checking.

Choose the mock wrapper that matches your project's desired rigor and output verbosity:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_foo;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;
```

### Custom Test Main Function

If the built-in `gmock_main.cc` (which calls `InitGoogleMock`) does not fully suit your environment (for example, embedded platforms or special initialization needs), you can write a custom `main()` that manually initializes GoogleMock and GoogleTest, ensuring you integrate properly with your system’s startup sequence.

### Extending Mock Behavior

- **New Matchers and Actions**: You can define your own matchers and actions to tailor the assertions and mock behaviors beyond the built-in capabilities.
- **Delegating to Fake or Real Objects**: GoogleMock supports delegating mock calls to fake or real implementations, letting you extend or wrap behavior rather than totally replace it.

---

## Extending Test Output and Reporting

For teams wanting to feed test results into custom dashboards or report formats, the framework exposes event hooks:

- **Event Listeners**: Implement `::testing::TestEventListener` to intercept and react to test start/end events, failures, and output.
- **XML Output**: GoogleTest supports producing test results as XML files that many CI tools can consume.

### Example: Custom Event Listener Usage

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& info) override {
    // Custom start logic
  }

  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& info) override {
    // Custom end logic
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);

  ::testing::TestEventListeners& listeners =
      ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();

  listeners.Append(new MyListener);

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Use this to fit GoogleTest’s reporting seamlessly into your broader monitoring or dashboard systems.

## Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed with integration and extensibility at their core:

- They work smoothly with popular C++ build tools and compilers.
- They support CI/CD best practices like selective test execution, parallelism, and structured output.
- They offer user-friendly wrappers (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`) to control mock behavior and output verbosity.
- They provide comprehensive extension hooks for customizing mock behavior, test sequencing, and reporting.

Together, these patterns and hooks enable you to build robust, maintainable, and highly integrated automated test infrastructure.
