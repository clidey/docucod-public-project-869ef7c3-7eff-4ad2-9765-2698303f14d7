# Test Discovery and Execution Lifecycle

Understanding how GoogleTest discovers, executes, and reports tests is critical to mastering effective C++ testing workflows. This guide walks you through the full lifecycle of a test run — from how tests get registered automatically at compile time, through the runtime execution of test suites and individual tests, to how assertions affect control flow and results reporting.

---

## 1. Automatic Test Discovery and Registration

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests thanks to macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and others, which statically register each test case into the framework at compile time.

- When you write `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) { ... }`, GoogleTest creates a test object representing this test.
- This registration eliminates the need to explicitly maintain test lists, freeing you to focus on writing tests.
- Each registered test knows its fixture type, source location, and the test body.

> **Tip:** Naming your test suites and tests without underscores follows the recommended convention and ensures consistent discovery and filtering.
</Callout>

### How registration happens

1. The `TEST()` macro expands to code that calls internal GoogleTest APIs to register the test class and test function.
2. The test framework builds an internal registry of test suites and tests before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called.
3. At runtime, GoogleTest consults this registry to decide which tests to run.

---

## 2. Test Execution Flow

Once tests are discovered and registered, execution begins typically via `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` inside your `main()`.

### High-level process:

1. **Global Initialization:**
   - `testing::InitGoogleTest()` processes command-line flags related to test filtering, output, and behavior.
   - Global test environments registered via `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` are set up.

2. **Test Suite Handling:**
   - For each test suite, `SetUpTestSuite()` (or `SetUpTestCase()`) runs once before any test in that suite.

3. **Test Case Execution:**
   - GoogleTest creates a fresh test fixture object per individual test.
   - The fixture’s `SetUp()` method executes before the test body.
   - The test code runs.
   - The fixture’s `TearDown()` method executes after the test body.

4. **Test Suite Teardown:**
   - `TearDownTestSuite()` (or `TearDownTestCase()`) runs once after all tests in that suite complete.

5. **Global Cleanup:**
   - Teardown methods of global environments run.
   - `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` returns an exit code based on test success or failure.

### Important behaviors:

- Tests run in isolation: each test runs with a fresh fixture object ensuring no unwanted state sharing.
- Ordering of tests is not guaranteed unless shuffling or filtering flags are used.
- If a fatal failure occurs in a test, that test stops immediately, but subsequent tests still run.

## 3. Test Lifecycle Hooks

GoogleTest provides lifecycle hooks that you can override in your test fixtures to set up and clean up resources.

| Hook                      | When It Runs                              | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `static SetUpTestSuite()` | Before the first test in the suite        | Initialize shared resources for the entire suite         |
| `SetUp()`                 | Before each individual test               | Prepare objects or context needed for the test            |
| Test Body (`TestBody()`)  | The actual test code                       | The code executed and evaluated by GoogleTest              |
| `TearDown()`              | After each test                           | Clean up resources allocated in `SetUp()`                 |
| `static TearDownTestSuite()`| After all tests in the suite have run   | Release shared resources                                 |

<Callout>
> **Note**: For test fixtures, GoogleTest creates a new instance for each test, so instance members reset between tests.
</Callout>

## 4. Assertion Impact on Execution

Assertions are the core mechanism for verifying expected behavior in tests. GoogleTest distinguishes between **fatal** and **non-fatal** failures:

| Assertion Macro Prefix | Behavior on Failure                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ASSERT_*`            | Fatal failure: aborts the current test function immediately |
| `EXPECT_*`            | Non-fatal failure: records failure but continues executing the test |

### Practical implications

- Use `ASSERT_*` when continuing the test after a failure makes no sense, e.g., dereferencing a null pointer.
- Use `EXPECT_*` when you want to check multiple conditions and gather all failures at once, improving testing efficiency.

#### Example usage:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  ASSERT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1) << "Factorial of zero should be 1";
  // Code below runs only if ASSERT_EQ passes
  EXPECT_GT(Factorial(1), 0);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
}
```

<Callout>
> **Caution:** Using `ASSERT_*` inside constructors or destructors is not allowed as it can cause partial construction/destruction. Instead, put such assertions inside `SetUp()` or `TearDown()`.
</Callout>

---

## 5. Isolation and Independence of Tests

GoogleTest guarantees each test is isolated:

- Each test gets a *fresh* fixture object — no shared instance data between tests.
- Tests are run independently; no reliance on other tests' execution.
- Testing results are deterministic and reproducible when run individually or as part of the whole suite.

This isolation ensures failures are easier to diagnose and tests don't interfere, allowing safe parallel execution strategies.

---

## 6. Test Result Reporting

After execution, GoogleTest aggregates results:

- Individual assertions contribute to the overall test result.
- If any assertion fails, the test finishes as failed.
- All tests in a suite are reported grouped by test suites.
- GoogleTest outputs results both on the console and optionally to XML or JSON files (configurable via flags).

### Test Run Summary Example:

```none
[==========] Running 10 tests from 3 test suites.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput
[       OK ] FactorialTest.HandlesZeroInput (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput (1 ms)
[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (1 ms total)
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 10 tests from 3 test suites ran. (15 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 9 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] FactorialTest.HandlesPositiveInput

 1 FAILED TEST
```

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues in Test Discovery and Execution">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Found">
Make sure you use the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros to define your tests and do not manually list tests.
Confirm your test executable includes all relevant object files.
Verify that you do not prefix test suite or test names with `DISABLED_` unless intentionally skipping.
Check if filters in command line flags `--gtest_filter` exclude your tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Failing Prematurely Due to Fixture Setup">
Confirm `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods are spelled correctly (capitalize `U`).
Avoid fatal assertions in constructors or destructors; place them in `SetUp()` or test body.
Ensure resource cleanup happens properly in `TearDown()` to avoid test pollution.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Order of Tests">
Tests run in an arbitrary order unless shuffling or ordering flags are used.
If order matters (which is discouraged), control with sequences or dependencies cautiously.
Use sharding or parallel execution carefully to avoid hidden shared state problems.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary
This guide outlines the entire lifecycle of a GoogleTest run, from static discovery and registration of tests at compile-time to runtime execution flow and final reporting. It covers key user-facing lifecycle hooks, the impact of assertion types on execution, and the isolation GoogleTest maintains between test cases. A detailed Mermaid diagram visualizes the execution flow for clarity.

By understanding this lifecycle, users gain insight into how tests are organized internally, enabling them to write better structured and more reliable tests while effectively managing setup and teardown of test resources.

---

## Practical Tips
- Always use the GoogleTest macros to define and register your tests to ensure they show up and run.
- Use `EXPECT_*` to report multiple assertion failures in a test, reserving `ASSERT_*` for mandatory conditions.
- Implement shared expensive setup in `SetUpTestSuite()` and per-test setup in `SetUp()`.
- Return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()` function to indicate overall test success or failure.
