# Scalability & Performance Characteristics

This guide explores the architectural features and design considerations within GoogleMock that enable efficient execution of large-scale test suites. You will learn about resource usage, parallelism options, test selection and filtering, and recommended practices to minimize test suite latency.

## Understanding Resource Utilization in Large Test Suites

When scaling test suites to hundreds or thousands of tests, resource management becomes critical. GoogleMock's architecture is designed to balance memory consumption and execution speed:

- **Mock Object Lifecycle:** Mocks are lightweight by default but maintain sufficient metadata to track expectations and calls. Efficient destruction and verification ensure test isolation without excessive overhead.
- **Expectation Management:** The framework tracks expectations using optimized internal structures, allowing quick matching without scanning all expectations linearly.

**Best Practice:** Define mock classes succinctly using `MOCK_METHOD` to avoid unnecessary bloat in mock implementation and reduce compilation time.

## Parallelism and Concurrency Support

Performance gains are achieved by running tests concurrently where possible. GoogleMock supports multithreaded test execution safely:

- **Thread-Safe Mock Objects:** Internal synchronization ensures that mocks can safely be accessed from multiple threads. See the `StressTest` suite for demonstration of correctness under concurrent usage.
- **Isolation of Test Execution:** Each thread executes separate test instances or mock objects where applicable to prevent data races.

### Example: Concurrent Mock Usage

```cpp
class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n));
  MOCK_METHOD(char, Baz, (const char* s1, const std::string& s2));
};

void ThreadRoutine(MockFoo* foo) {
  ON_CALL(*foo, Bar(_)).WillByDefault(Return(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(*foo, Baz(_, _));
  ... // Use foo in concurrent scenarios
}
```

This pattern is safe, enabling adjusting the degree of parallelism to available hardware.

## Test Selection and Filtering Mechanisms

Efficiency also comes from running only relevant tests. GoogleMock inherits GoogleTest’s robust filtering capabilities:

- You can select tests using command-line options or via code, allowing partial runs during development.
- Filtering reduces overall resource consumption and accelerates feedback.

**Tip:** Use test suite and test names that reflect test purpose clearly to leverage filtering effectively.

## Minimizing Test Suite Latency

To keep large test suites responsive, consider:

- **Retiring Expectations on Saturation:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations as soon as their upper bound calls are met, reducing overhead on mock matching.

- **Optimizing Expectations:** Avoid overly broad or overly precise expectations that can cause excessive matching work or brittle tests.

- **Using Default Actions Smartly:** Define `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors to reduce the number of explicit expectations and thereby lower matching complexity.

- **Using Strictness Modes Judiciously:** Leveraging `NiceMock` reduces warning noise and improves test clarity, while `StrictMock` catches unexpected calls early at the cost of stricter maintenance.

---

## Key Architectural Elements Supporting Scalability

- **Expectation Storage:** Expectations are stored in efficient containers with quick lookup.
- **Matching Order:** Latest expectations override older ones, allowing flexible and less brittle test specifications.
- **Sequences and Partial Orders:** The ability to specify ordered and partially ordered expectations enables fine control without over-constraining, reducing unnecessary verification steps.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

If your test suite experiences latency or resource strain:

1. Check for overly verbose or unnecessary expectations increasing matching work.
2. Consider restructuring mocks to minimize deep call hierarchies.
3. Use parallel test execution appropriately.
4. Confirm that expectations retire promptly where applicable.
5. Use GoogleMock’s `--gmock_verbose` flags to trace unexpected or uninteresting calls.

---

## Summary

GoogleMock is designed to efficiently support large-scale test suites with features that promote optimal resource utilization, thread-safe parallel execution, selective test running, and mechanisms to keep test latency low. By applying best practices such as expectation retirement, default action setting, and managing mock strictness, users can ensure their test suites remain fast, maintainable, and robust as they scale.
