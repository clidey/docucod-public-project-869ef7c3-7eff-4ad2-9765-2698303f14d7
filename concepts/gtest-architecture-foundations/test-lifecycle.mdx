# Test Discovery and Execution Lifecycle

GoogleTest automates the discovery, organization, and execution of tests in C++ projects. Understanding this lifecycle helps you effectively write, run, and manage tests, especially for configuring set-up and tear-down behavior that supports test isolation and resource management.

---

## Overview

When you run your GoogleTest-based test program, the framework orchestrates the process by:

- Discovering all defined tests across your program automatically.
- Organizing tests into logical groups called *test suites*.
- Executing each test independently while managing setup and cleanup.
- Reporting individual test results and overall statistics.

This lifecycle ensures tests remain isolated, repeatable, and informative.

---

## Test Discovery

GoogleTest automatically tracks tests defined with the `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and similar macros during the program initialization phase.

- Each test registers itself with the framework, so **you don't need to manually enumerate tests**.
- Tests are grouped by their *test suite* names reflecting logical organization.
- Test discovery occurs before the main test execution begins.

This automatic registration supports effortless scaling as the number of tests grows.

---

## Test Suite and Test Organization

Tests are structured hierarchically:

- **Test Suites** group related tests. Suites share common setup and teardown logic via *test fixtures*.
- Each **Test** is a single check verifying a particular program behavior.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Both tests above belong to the `FactorialTest` suite.

---

## Execution Phases

GoogleTest executes tests in a well-defined sequence:

1. **Global Setup** (optional)
   - Runs *environment-level* setup through `Environment::SetUp()`.
   - Used to prepare shared resources across all tests.

2. **Test Suite Setup**
   - `SetUpTestSuite()` executes once before the first test in the suite.
   - Ideal for expensive shared initialization.

3. **Individual Test Setup**
   - For each test, GoogleTest creates a new *test fixture* instance.
   - Calls `SetUp()` to prepare per-test state.

4. **Test Execution**
   - The test body runs and contains assertions.

5. **Individual Test Teardown**
   - Calls `TearDown()` to clean up test-specific resources.
   - Deletes the test fixture instance.

6. **Test Suite Teardown**
   - After the last test, calls `TearDownTestSuite()`.
   - Cleans up shared test suite resources.

7. **Global Teardown**
   - `Environment::TearDown()` is called after all tests complete.

Each step provides clear separation and lifecycle management for resources.

---

## Role of the Test Runner

At the heart of the process is the **test runner**, which:

- Manages the discovery, ordering, and filtering of tests.
- Coordinates setup and teardown at global, suite, and test levels.
- Executes each test and captures assertion results.
- Handles fatal failures by skipping subsequent steps but continuing with other tests.
- Summarizes the test results at the end, including passed, failed, and skipped tests.

The test runner shields you from the complexity of test lifecycle orchestration.

---

## Setup and Tear-Down Details

GoogleTest provides hooks for users to customize setup and teardown:

- **At the Global Level:**
  - Implement subclasses of `::testing::Environment`.
  - Register them with `::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
  - Define `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for environment-wide initialization and cleanup.

- **At the Test Suite Level:**
  - Define static `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` functions in your test fixture.
  - Used to allocate or leak expensive resources common to tests in the suite.

- **At the Individual Test Level:**
  - Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods in your test fixture class.
  - Called before and after each test respectively.

### Important Notes:

- Each test runs on a fresh fixture instance to ensure no side-effects leak across tests.
- The order of tests is undefined; do not rely on test ordering to run setup or cleanup.
- Use `static` members in fixtures carefully, ensure proper cleanup to avoid leaks.

---

## User Flow Example

Consider writing a test for a queue class:

1. Define a fixture with shared queues and setup:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
protected:
  static std::queue<int> shared_queue;

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // initialize shared_queue contents
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // run before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // run after each test
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // cleanup shared resource
  }
};
```

2. Write tests using this fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(shared_queue.empty());
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, EnqueueIncreasesSize) {
  shared_queue.push(42);
  EXPECT_EQ(shared_queue.size(), 1);
}
```

3. When `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` runs:
   - Global environment setup runs
   - `SetUpTestSuite()` runs once
   - Each test runs in isolation:
     - Fixture instance created
     - `SetUp()` runs
     - Test code runs
     - `TearDown()` runs
     - Fixture instance destroyed
   - After last test, `TearDownTestSuite()` runs
   - Global environment teardown runs

Any failures cause GoogleTest to report detailed diagnostics and proceed with other tests.

## Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Do not share non-static state across tests unintentionally.** Each test gets a fresh fixture.
- **Avoid test dependencies and ordering assumptions.** Keep tests independent & repeatable.
- **Use `SetUpTestSuite()` for expensive shared initialization.** Don’t recreate resource per test if not required.
- **Always clean up resources in `TearDownTestSuite()` or `TearDown()`.** Prevent resource leaks.
- **Handle fatal failures cautiously.** GoogleTest aborts test body on fatal assertion, but completes tear down.
- **Register all `Environment` objects before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.** GoogleTest owns these objects.
- **Don’t ignore the return from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.** It indicates success or failure.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Running

- Ensure all tests are registered before calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Linking with `gtest_main` provides a suitable `main()` that runs tests.
- Custom `main()` functions should call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### Setup or Tear-Down Not Executing

- Check that static functions are named exactly `SetUpTestSuite()` / `TearDownTestSuite()`.
- Use `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` to register global environment objects.
- Avoid typos: using `SetupTestSuite` will not be called.

### Test State Leaks Between Tests

- Remember that GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance per test.
- Do not use shared mutable static variables without synchronization.

### Tests Skipping or Failing Unexpectedly

- Check for `GTEST_SKIP()` calls.
- Consult test output for skipped or failed messages.

### Test Order of Execution

- Test execution order is undefined; tests should not rely on order.
- Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses only to verify call order on mocks during execution.

Use fixtures for isolated test environments.
Configure global environments responsibly.
Return and check the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
Avoid sharing mutable state between tests that can introduce flakiness.
