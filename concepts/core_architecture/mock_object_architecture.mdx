# Mock Object Design & Behavior

GoogleMock (gMock) empowers C++ developers to create **mock objects**—stand-ins that simulate real objects by predefining their expected interactions within unit tests. This page details how these mock objects are structured and governed throughout their lifecycle, how expectations and behaviors are defined, and how `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` wrappers customize call validation responses.

## What Is a Mock Object?

Imagine you’re building software that depends on external components—databases, hardware devices, or complex APIs. Testing such software reliably and quickly requires replacing real dependencies with lightweight substitutes. These substitutes are called *mock objects*.

A mock object:

- Implements the same interface as the real object.
- Lets you specify *expectations* about which methods will be called, with what arguments, how many times, and in what order.
- Offers *actions* that define what should happen when methods are invoked (e.g., return values or side effects).

Unlike fake objects—which provide simplified but actual implementations—mock objects focus on verifying *interactions*. This makes tests resilient, fast, and precise in checking that your code communicates correctly with its dependencies.

## Defining Mock Objects in gMock

Using gMock, a mock class is created by inheriting from the interface you want to mock and declaring mock methods with the `MOCK_METHOD` macro. 

### How to Define a Mock Method:

- Use `MOCK_METHOD(return_type, method_name, (args...), (specs...));` inside the `public:` section of your mock class.
- If overriding a `const` or `noexcept` method, specify `(const)` or `(noexcept)` in specs.
- You can also specify calling conventions using `Calltype(...)`.

**Example:** For a `Turtle` interface:

```cpp
class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};
```

No separate implementations are needed; `MOCK_METHOD` generates the necessary code.

### Tips for Organizing Mocks:

- Define mocks you own or control. For external interfaces, contribute mock classes near the interface to centralize maintenance.
- Avoid mocking concrete classes without interfaces; prefer adapter patterns.

## Specifying Expectations and Actions

Mocks do nothing unless you tell them what to expect and how to behave.

### Setting Default Behaviors with `ON_CALL`

`ON_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers...))` specifies the *default action* when a method is called but not explicitly expected:

```cpp
ON_CALL(turtle, Forward(_))
    .WillByDefault(Return());
```

Default actions do not verify that the method is called, they just define behavior when called.

### Setting Call Expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`

`EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers...))` not only defines behaviors but also asserts that calls happen as expected:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
    .Times(1)
    .WillOnce(Return());
```

Chainable clauses modify expectations in a precise order:

- `.With(multi_arg_matcher)` — restricts the expectation to calls matching a composite matcher on all arguments
- `.Times(cardinality)` — how many times the method should be called
- `.InSequence(sequence...)` — specifies strict call order within one or more sequences
- `.After(expectations...)` — specifies that this expectation can only be matched after other expectations
- `.WillOnce(action)` — action for a single matching call
- `.WillRepeatedly(action)` — action for matching calls after `.WillOnce()` clauses are exhausted
- `.RetiresOnSaturation()` — disables the expectation after it is saturated (call count reached)

### Matching Arguments

You can specify exact values or use matchers:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(foo, Bar(Ge(5), _));  // First arg >= 5, second arg anything
```

***

## Lifecycle and Call Matching

When a mock object method is called, gMock searches for matching expectations **in reverse order** of definition (newest overrides oldest). The first *active* expectation whose argument matchers pass and whose prerequisites are met will be invoked.

- Expectations that are saturated (i.e., hit the upper call limit) are generally still considered, unless they have `RetiresOnSaturation()`.
- If no `EXPECT_CALL` matches, but there is a matching `ON_CALL` default action, that action is executed without error.
- If there is no matching expectation nor default, behavior depends on the mock's strictness level.

### Managing Multiple Expectations

You can specify multiple expectations on the same method to cover different scenarios. Since newer expectations override older ones, careful ordering matters.

### Ordering Calls

To enforce call order, wrap expectations inside an `InSequence` block or use `InSequence()` clause.

```cpp
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Init());
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Start());
}
```

This requires `Init()` before `Start()`. For partial orders, use `.After()` clauses or multiple sequences to express directed acyclic graphs of call ordering.

### Retiring Expectations

By default, expectations stay active unless explicitly retired. `RetiresOnSaturation()` causes an expectation to become inactive as soon as it's saturated, allowing fallback to older or more general expectations.

## Customizing Uninteresting Call Behavior

An *uninteresting call* is a call to a mock method for which no `EXPECT_CALL` is set.

By default, gMock treats these as **naggy**:

- They execute the default action.
- They emit a warning message.

### NiceMock, NaggyMock, and StrictMock

To control uninteresting call behavior on a per-mock basis:

- `NaggyMock<T>` (default): Warns on uninteresting calls.
- `NiceMock<T>`: Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls.
- `StrictMock<T>`: Treats uninteresting calls as fatal test failures.

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;  // No warnings for unexpected calls
```

They wrap your mock class and inherit all constructors transparently.

### Important Caveats

- Wrappers only affect direct mocks, not mocks inherited from base classes.
- Use `NiceMock` primarily to reduce noise during test development.
- `StrictMock` enforces stricter correctness but may cause brittleness.

---

## Verifying and Managing Mocks

- When a mock object is destructed, gMock automatically verifies all expectations have been met.
- You can force verification early with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_object)`.
- Avoid setting new expectations after verification; this leads to undefined behavior.
- To suppress errors about leaks (never deleted mocks), use `Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_object)`.

---

## Practical Developer Workflow

Here is a typical flow using GoogleMock mock objects:

1. Define your mock class inheriting from the interface, using `MOCK_METHOD` declarations.
2. Create mock object instances in your tests, often locally scoped.
3. Set *default behaviors* using `ON_CALL()`, typically in test fixtures to prepare common behaviors.
4. Set precise *expectations* using `EXPECT_CALL()` in each test, before exercising the code under test.
5. Execute code that uses mocks.
6. Tests fail immediately upon unexpected calls or violated expectations; otherwise, verify on destruction or manually.

---

## Tips and Best Practices

- Set expectations before the code under test calls the mocked methods.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress noise when you don’t care about uninteresting calls.
- Prefer specifying only necessary argument constraints; avoid brittle tests by over-specification.
- Use sequences and `.After()` to impose ordering.
- Employ `.RetiresOnSaturation()` for expectations that should become inactive after matching certain calls.
- Use `ON_CALL()` to define default behaviors for methods called without expectations.
- For overloaded methods, fully specify the signature or use `Const()` wrapper where appropriate.
- Avoid mocking classes you don’t own unless necessary.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

- **Unexpected Calls:** Usually means you have missing or incorrect `EXPECT_CALL`s.
- **Warnings on Uninteresting Calls:** Use `NiceMock` or add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(method(_)).Times(AnyNumber())`.
- **Duplicate Failure Messages:** gMock reports failures per call, even if repeated, to help identify multiple issues.
- **Mock Object Not Verified:** Ensure mock objects are destroyed or call explicit verification.

## Illustrative Example

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::NiceMock;

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
};

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsLine) {
  NiceMock<MockTurtle> turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));

  // Code under test uses turtle
  turtle.PenDown();
  turtle.Forward(100);
}
```

In this test, we verify that `PenDown()` is called at least once and `Forward(100)` is called exactly once. The use of `NiceMock` suppresses warnings for calls to other methods.
