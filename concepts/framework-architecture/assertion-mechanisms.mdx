# Assertion Mechanisms and Failure Reporting

GoogleTest’s assertion system is foundational for capturing test results, diagnosing problems, and guiding users to robust and correct C++ code. This guide explains the key concepts behind assertions, how GoogleTest manages success and failure reporting, and how you can effectively leverage built-in and user-defined assertions for clear, actionable test outcomes.

---

## 1. Understanding Assertion Outcomes: Fatal vs Nonfatal Failures

GoogleTest distinguishes between two primary assertion results:

- **Fatal Failures:** These immediately abort the current test or subroutine, preventing further execution within that context. They signal conditions from which continuing the test is either impossible or meaningless.
- **Nonfatal Failures:** These report an error but allow the current test function to continue running. This enables multiple checks within a single test which can provide richer diagnostics.

### Why Use Fatal or Nonfatal Failures?

Consider a function under test that returns a pointer. If the pointer is `nullptr`, subsequent calls on it will crash the test. Using a fatal failure allows you to stop before further invalid operations occur. On the other hand, if a test verifies multiple independent properties, nonfatal failures let you see all failed assertions in one go, improving productivity.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(FixtureName, NonfatalVsFatal) {
  int* ptr = GetPointer();
  ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr) << "Pointer should not be nullptr"; // Fatal failure
  // The code below runs only if ptr is not nullptr
  EXPECT_EQ(*ptr, 42) << "Value pointed to should be 42";    // Nonfatal failure
}
```

## 2. Built-in Assertion Macros

GoogleTest provides a comprehensive set of assertion macros, grouped by priority and usage:

### 2.1 Explicit Success and Failure

- `SUCCEED()` - declares a successful assertion explicitly (mostly for documentation or signaling branches).
- `FAIL()` - generates an immediate fatal failure.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` - generates an immediate nonfatal failure.

### 2.2 Boolean Condition Checks

- `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)` / `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`
- `EXPECT_FALSE(condition)` / `ASSERT_FALSE(condition)`

Use these to assert simple Boolean conditions.

### 2.3 Binary Comparisons

- Equality: `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)`
- Inequality: `EXPECT_NE(val1, val2)` / `ASSERT_NE(val1, val2)`
- Relational: `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE`

These macros invoke operator comparisons and provide insightful failure messages including the actual values.

### 2.4 String Comparisons

Specialized macros for C-strings and wide strings, such as:

- `EXPECT_STREQ(str1, str2)` to check for exact content equality.
- `EXPECT_STRNE`, `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, `EXPECT_STRCASENE`.

### 2.5 Floating-Point Assertions

Due to precision issues with floating-point numbers:

- `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ` / `ASSERT_FLOAT_EQ` - approximate equality for floats.
- `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` / `ASSERT_DOUBLE_EQ` - approximate equality for doubles.
- `EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, abs_error)` - values must be within a specified absolute distance.

### 2.6 Exception Assertions

- `EXPECT_THROW(statement, exception_type)` / `ASSERT_THROW`
- `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW`

Require exceptions to be enabled in the build environment.

### 2.7 Predicate Assertions

Allow more complex predicates with clear diagnostics.

- `EXPECT_PRED1/2/3/4/5(predicate, val1, val2, ...)`
- `EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1/2/...` for custom formatted predicate outputs.

### 2.8 Death Assertions

Verify that code causes program termination and produces expected output.

- `EXPECT_DEATH(statement, regex)` / `ASSERT_DEATH`
- Variants: `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH`, `EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED`, `EXPECT_EXIT`

---

## 3. User-Defined Assertions and Custom Messages

GoogleTest makes it straightforward to add informative context to failed assertions:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2) << "Custom failure message with values: " << val1 << ", " << val2;
```

This can make debugging faster by immediately displaying what went wrong without scanning the entire test code.

### Writing Custom Assertions

Users can write customized assertions by returning `testing::AssertionResult` objects. This lets you encapsulate complex checks and produce detailed diagnostics.

Example:

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even.";
}

TEST(CustomAssertionTest, CheckEven) {
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, 4);  // passes
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, 5);  // fails with message
}
```

## 4. Failure Handling and Status Codes

When an assertion fails, GoogleTest reports details such as:

- The file and line number.
- The actual and expected values.
- The failing expression.

### Differentiating Between Assertion Results

- Assertions starting with `EXPECT_` generate **nonfatal** failures allowing the test to continue.
- Assertions starting with `ASSERT_` generate **fatal** failures aborting the current function.

This choice controls test flow.

### Automatic Verification

- GoogleTest automatically verifies expectations when a mock object is destroyed.
- Users can manually trigger verification with `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);` if the mock object lifecycle is managed externally.

---

## 5. Interactions with GoogleMock

GoogleMock integrates tightly with the assertion system:

- When mock expectations fail, GoogleMock generates appropriate failures using GoogleTest macros.
- `EXPECT_CALL()` specifies expected interactions; failure to meet these expectations results in clear, detailed GoogleTest failure messages.
- Uninteresting or unexpected calls generate warnings or failures based on mock strictness.

---

## 6. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Prefer nonfatal (`EXPECT_`) assertions when checking multiple conditions in the same test.
- Use fatal (`ASSERT_`) assertions to guard preconditions needed to continue test execution.
- Add meaningful failure messages for clarity.
- Write custom assertions when repeated complex checks are needed.
- Use GoogleMock’s features to manage expectations and verification efficiently.
- Run tests with the `--gtest_break_on_failure` flag for immediate debugging.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Uninteresting mock function calls:** Warnings appear if a mock method is called without any `EXPECT_CALL` defined; use `NiceMock` or add expectations to suppress.
- **Unexpected calls:** Failures occur when calls do not match any active expectations.
- **Multiple matching expectations:** GoogleMock selects the last declared matching expectation; ensure order reflects test intent.

### Debugging Failed Expectations

- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed tracing of mock calls and matching expectations.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL(...).RetiresOnSaturation()` to manage sticky expectations that linger after usage.
