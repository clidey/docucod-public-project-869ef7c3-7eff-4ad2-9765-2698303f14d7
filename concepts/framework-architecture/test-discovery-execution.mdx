# Test Discovery, Registration, and Execution

GoogleTest achieves a seamless and automated workflow for running C++ tests through a well-orchestrated mechanism that discovers, registers, selects, orders, and executes tests without manual intervention. This page breaks down how GoogleTest handles these vital processes so that you can understand and harness the framework efficiently.

---

## How GoogleTest Discovers Tests Automatically

### Test Definitions and Automatic Registration

When you write tests using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or similar macros, GoogleTest **automatically registers these tests** at static initialization time. You do not need to explicitly list or add tests to any registry. This automated discovery is a cornerstone feature that frees you from maintaining test lists.

Each test is associated with:
- A **test suite name** (previously called *test case*).
- A **test name**.

When your test program starts, all tests defined in the linked translation units have already registered themselves in a global test registry.

### Example

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(1), 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(2), 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
}
```

Here, both tests are automatically registered under the test suite `FactorialTest`.

---

## Test Selection and Filtering

### Running All Tests: `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

The heart of test execution is the `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` function, which:

1. Enumerates all registered tests.
2. Applies filters and flags set at runtime to determine which tests should run.
3. Creates fresh test fixture instances for each test.
4. Executes the test and reports results.

If all tests succeed, `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1.

### Filtering Tests

You can control which tests to run using command-line flags parsed by `InitGoogleTest()`:

- `--gtest_filter=` allows selecting specific tests by suite and/or test name with wildcards.

For example, to run only tests in the `Math` suite beginning with `Add`:

```bash
./my_tests --gtest_filter=Math.Add*
```

This lets you rapidly focus on subsets of your suite without rebuilding or changing code.

### Test Ordering

By default, tests run in the order of their registration, which is typically the order they appear in your source files. GoogleTest does not reorder tests automatically.

You can influence test ordering by:
- Rearranging the source code order.
- Using test filters to select and control execution.

### Parallelization

GoogleTest itself does not parallelize tests out-of-the-box but works well with external tools and CI systems that launch multiple test binaries or run tests in parallel processes.

---

## The Test Execution Lifecycle

Each test follows a standardized lifecycle that guarantees isolation, reproducibility, and precise failure reporting.

1. **Test Fixture Setup:**
   - For `TEST_F()`, GoogleTest constructs a fresh test fixture object, then calls `SetUp()`.

2. **Test Body Execution:**
   - Executes the code inside the test.
   - Assertions and expectations report failures.

3. **Test Fixture Teardown:**
   - Calls `TearDown()`.
   - Destroys the test fixture object.

Each test runs independently, ensuring side effects or failures do not affect others.

### Customizing Setup and Teardown

You can override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` in your test fixtures to arrange and clean resources.

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code here runs before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Code here runs after each test
  }
};
```

## Typical User Flow: Defining and Running Tests

Here is how you typically interact with GoogleTest regarding test discovery and execution:

<Steps>
<Step title="Write Tests Using TEST() and TEST_F()">
Define your test cases and optionally fixtures. GoogleTest registers these automatically.
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize GoogleTest">
Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` early in your `main` to parse flags and set up.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Tests">
Invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to run all registered tests matching your filters.
</Step>
<Step title="Analyze Results">
Examine output summary, including passed/failed counts and detailed failure messages.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Entry Points and Main Function

Most users do not write their own `main()` function. Instead, link against `gtest_main` (or `gmock_main` if using GoogleMock), which provides an appropriate main entry point that:

- Calls `InitGoogleTest()`
- Calls and returns `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` result

When you need custom startup logic, you can write your own `main()` with this pattern:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **No Tests Found:** Make sure that your test source files are included and linked correctly.
- **Tests Not Running With Filter:** Verify proper syntax of `--gtest_filter` and that test suite/test names match exactly.
- **Unexpected Ordering:** GoogleTest runs tests based on registration order. To isolate execution order effects, consider filtering or redesigning tests to be independent.
- **Tests Hang or Crash Early:** Confirm proper initialization with `InitGoogleTest()`. Check for static initialization issues.

---

## Practical Tips for Effective Test Management

- Name your test suites and tests clearly and consistently to improve filtering and readability.
- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) to manage shared setup and teardown.
- Run tests frequently with filters during development for speedy feedback.
- Leverage GoogleTest flags like `--gtest_repeat=NUM` to detect flaky tests.
