# Mocking Infrastructure and Workflow

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest by providing a powerful framework for defining and controlling mock objects in C++ tests. This page helps you understand how mock classes, expectations, and stubs fit into the testing lifecycle, enabling robust behavior verification and interaction testing.

## Introduction to GoogleMock’s Mocking Model

At its core, GoogleMock lets you replace real objects with **mock objects** that imitate their interfaces but provide controlled, testable behavior. This interaction-based testing approach ensures that your code uses its dependencies correctly, calling expected methods with valid arguments, in the right order and frequency.

### Key Components

- **Mock Classes:** User-defined C++ classes that inherit from interfaces or base classes, where virtual methods are replaced by mocked methods using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.
- **Expectations:** Declarative statements set via `EXPECT_CALL` indicating which mock method calls your test expects, how many times, with which arguments, and what results.
- **Stubs (Default Actions):** Behavior definitions set with `ON_CALL` to specify what a mock method should *do* by default without requiring strict expectations.

Mock objects seamlessly integrate with the GoogleTest lifecycle, automatically verifying expectations at destruction and reporting any deviations.

## Defining and Using Mock Classes

GoogleMock requires you to define mock classes that declare mock methods corresponding to the real interfaces you use. Each mocked method is created via the `MOCK_METHOD` macro, which takes:

```cpp
class MockInterface : public Interface {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(ReturnType, MethodName, (ArgTypes...), (optional_qualifiers));
};
```

This macro generates code to intercept method calls and redirect them to GoogleMock’s internal handling, enabling fine-grained control of method behavior and verification.

### Best Practices for Mock Classes

- Always place `MOCK_METHOD` declarations in the `public:` section, regardless of original method access.
- When mocking overloaded or templated methods, ensure all relevant overloads are declared or use `using` to unhide base class methods.
- Use the `(override)` qualifier when overriding virtual methods to catch signature mismatches early.
- Avoid mocking concrete classes directly; prefer mocking interfaces or abstract base classes to maintain test maintainability and decoupling.

### Example

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
   virtual ~Turtle() = default;
   virtual void PenUp() = 0;
   virtual void PenDown() = 0;
   virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
   virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
   MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
   MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
   MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};
```

## Setting Up Expectations and Stubs

### Expectations — `EXPECT_CALL`

Use `EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(args_matchers))` to specify calls you expect during test execution. Expectations specify:

- **Which methods** will be called
- **With what arguments** (using expressive argument matchers)
- **How many times** (cardinality via `Times()` or inferred)
- **In what order** (using sequences or `.After()`)
- **What behavior** (actions like `Return()`, `Invoke()`, or custom lambdas)

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(Ge(10)))
    .Times(AtLeast(1))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return());
```

This expects that `turtle.Forward()` will be called at least once with argument >= 10.

#### Important Usage Notes

- Expectations must be set **before** exercising the code under test.
- If the expectation is unmet or violated, tests fail immediately with detailed diagnostics.
- The order of multiple expectations matters as GoogleMock matches calls to the **last matching expectation**, so put specific expectations after general catch-alls.
- You can specify strict ordering using `InSequence` or `After` to reflect dependencies.

### Stubs / Default Behavior — `ON_CALL`

`ON_CALL(mock_obj, Method(args_matchers))` lets you specify default behavior of mock methods without enforcing call counts or order.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_turtle, GetX())
    .WillByDefault(Return(100));
```

This means `GetX()` returns 100 if no expectations override it.

Use `ON_CALL` to set up common default behaviors, and `EXPECT_CALL` to declare verifications.

>TIP: Overusing `EXPECT_CALL` can lead to fragile tests; prefer `ON_CALL` where verification is not crucial.

## Mock Object Life Cycle and Verification

- When the mock object is destroyed, GoogleMock automatically verifies that all expectations were satisfied.
- If a mock object is never destroyed (e.g., leaked), expectations may not be verified; consider heap checking or explicitly invoking `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock)`.
- You can clear expectations or reset mock behavior using `Mock::VerifyAndClear()`.

## Controlling Expectations and Behavior with Fluent Syntax

GoogleMock provides a rich fluent interface for refining expectations:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, Method(args))
  .With(multi_arg_matcher)  // for matching full argument tuple
  .Times(cardinality)       // expected call count
  .InSequence(sequence1, sequence2)  // call order constraints
  .After(other_expectation)           // call order constraints
  .WillOnce(action)          // action for one call
  .WillRepeatedly(action)    // action for all further calls
  .RetiresOnSaturation();    // retire expectation when saturated
```

### Typical Example of Usage

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::InSequence;

{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenDown());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, Forward(Ge(50)));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_turtle, PenUp());
}

ON_CALL(mock_turtle, GetX()).WillByDefault(Return(42));

// Execute code that calls mock_turtle
```

This tells GoogleMock to verify the order of method invocations alongside method results.

## Handling Special Call Cases

- **Uninteresting calls:** Calls to mock methods without `EXPECT_CALL`; by default, they generate warnings but don't cause failures. Wrap mock objects with `NiceMock` to suppress warnings, or `StrictMock` to treat uninteresting calls as errors.
- **Unexpected calls:** Calls to mock methods with `EXPECT_CALL`s but with argument mismatch or exceeding call counts; always treated as test failures.

## Summary Recommendations

- Use `ON_CALL` to define common default behaviors.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL` only to specify verifications.
- Use `NiceMock` to simplify tests when unimportant calls can be ignored.
- Use `StrictMock` when wanting strict verification of all interactions.
- Structure expectations with `InSequence` and `After` for verifying correction call order.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Missing virtual destructors:** Ensure base interfaces have virtual destructors for correct mock destruction and verification.
- **Compilation errors with complex mocks:** Wrap return or argument types containing commas with parentheses or use type aliases.
- **Warnings about uninteresting calls:** Suppress with `NiceMock`, or add a catch-all `EXPECT_CALL(...).Times(AnyNumber())`.
