# Mock Object Philosophy and Patterns

Explore the design patterns behind GoogleMock’s approach to mocking, including how to express behavior, control strictness (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`), and model call expectations with cardinalities and actions. Learn how these abstractions deliver confidence in test isolation and simulation.

## Introduction

GoogleMock offers a powerful, expressive framework designed to simplify and enhance the experience of mocking in C++ tests. This page dives into the core philosophy of mock objects, illustrating how GoogleMock enables:

- Precise specification of behaviors and expectations on dependencies.
- Control over the strictness of mock objects (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`).
- Modeling and verification of call expectations using cardinalities and attached actions.

Understanding these patterns equips you with the vocabulary and mental models to effectively isolate and simulate complex interactions in your tests, ensuring robustness and clarity.

## Core Concepts of Mocking in GoogleMock

### What is a Mock Object?

A mock object imitates an interface or abstract class, allowing you to:

- Specify which of its methods will be called, and with which arguments.
- Define expected call counts and sequence.
- Control the results or side effects of method calls.
- Fail tests early when interactions deviate from specified expectations.

This level of control is essential to isolate units under test by simulating collaborators in a controlled, predictable way.

### Expressing Behavior and Expectations

GoogleMock distinguishes between _defining behavior_ of a mock method and _setting expectations_ regarding its invocation:

- **`ON_CALL`** sets default behavior for when a mock method is invoked, but it does **not** enforce that the call must occur.
- **`EXPECT_CALL`** sets expectations including behavior and invocation constraints like argument matching, call count, and call order.

This separation encourages writing tests that are both expressive and maintainable without over-specifying interaction details.

### Controlling Mock Strictness

GoogleMock provides three wrappers to control how uninteresting (unexpected or unspecified) calls are treated:

| Wrapper       | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls                      | Usage Scenario                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock<T>` | Ignores uninteresting calls (no warnings/errors).
| `NaggyMock<T>`| Logs warnings on uninteresting calls (default mock behavior).
| `StrictMock<T>`| Treats uninteresting calls as failures.

By choosing the wrapper, you can balance between:

- **Quiet tests** with relaxed expectations (`NiceMock`), ideal during initial stages.
- **Informational warnings** with `NaggyMock` signaling potentially missed expectations.
- **Hard enforcement** of call correctness with `StrictMock`, useful to guarantee exact interaction contracts.

### Modeling Call Expectations

#### Specifying Calls with `EXPECT_CALL`

At the center of GoogleMock’s predictive power is `EXPECT_CALL`, which allows you to declare:

- The mock object and method.
- Argument matchers specifying constraints on call parameters.
- Cardinality describing how many times the call is expected.
- Call order constraints (`InSequence`, `After`).
- Actions defining what happens when the call is matched.

#### Cardinalities (How Many Times?)

GoogleMock supports rich cardinalities to express expected call repetitions,
including:

- `Exactly(n)` (or simply `n`): Called exactly `n` times.
- `AtLeast(n)`: Called at least `n` times.
- `AtMost(n)`: Called at most `n` times.
- `Between(m, n)`: Called between `m` and `n` times, inclusive.
- `AnyNumber()`: Can be called any number of times.

If `Times()` is omitted, GoogleMock infers calls expected based on the presence of `WillOnce` and `WillRepeatedly` clauses to avoid verbosity.

#### Actions (What Does the Mock Do?)

You can attach **actions** to expectations to specify method behavior when called. Common actions include:

- `Return(value)`: Return a specific value.
- `ReturnRef(variable)`: Return a reference.
- `DoAll(...)`: Execute multiple actions in order.
- `Invoke(function or lambda)`: Call a real function or lambda.

Unspecified mock methods with return types have built-in default actions, returning zero, false, null, or default-constructed values.

#### Ordering Expectations

GoogleMock supports call ordering via:

- **Unordered** calls (default): The order doesn’t matter.
- **Sequences (`InSequence`)**: Expectations in the same sequence must be matched in order.
- **Partial Orders (`After`)**: More flexible call ordering can be expressed.

Ordering constraints help detect subtle bugs that depend on interaction timing.

## User Workflows and Examples

### Mock Setup and Usage

A typical user journey with GoogleMock’s patterns looks like this:

1. **Define Mock Class:** Use `MOCK_METHOD` macros in your mock class to mock interfaces.
2. **Create Mock Objects:** Instantiate your mocks, optionally wrapped in `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock`.
3. **Set Default Behavior:** Use `ON_CALL` to specify common default behaviors.
4. **Set Expectations:** Use `EXPECT_CALL` to express the calls your test expects, specifying argument constraints, cardinality, and actions.
5. **Execute Test Code:** Run the code under test that interacts with your mocks.
6. **Automatic Verification:** Upon mock destruction, GoogleMock verifies all expectations were met.

### Example: Using `NiceMock` and `EXPECT_CALL`

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Bar, (int), ());
};

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::NiceMock;

TEST(MockTest, NiceMockExample) {
  NiceMock<MockFoo> mock_foo;

  ON_CALL(mock_foo, Bar).WillByDefault([](int) { /* no-op */ });
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(42)).Times(AtLeast(1));

  mock_foo.Bar(42);  // Expected call.
  mock_foo.Bar(99);  // Uninteresting, no warning because of NiceMock.
}
```

### Handling Unexpected or Uninteresting Calls

- By default, uninteresting calls cause warnings.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress such warnings.
- Use `StrictMock` to fail tests if unexpected calls occur, enforcing tight contracts.

### Using Cardinalities and Actions

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Bar(_))
    .Times(3)
    .WillOnce(Return(1))
    .WillOnce(Return(2))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(3));
```

This expectation states:
- The method `Bar` will be called exactly 3 times.
- The first call returns 1.
- The second call returns 2.
- The third and subsequent (if any) calls return 3.

GoogleMock will fail the test if the call count diverges or arguments mismatch.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Set Expectations Before Use:** Always set `EXPECT_CALL`s before the mock method is invoked.
- **Use `ON_CALL` for Common Behavior:** Define shared default behaviors with `ON_CALL`, avoiding over-constraining tests.
- **Balance Strictness:** Use `NiceMock` for relaxed tests during development; switch to `StrictMock` to ensure correctness as tests mature.
- **Avoid Over-Specification:** Avoid specifying argument matchers and call orders unless necessary to keep tests maintainable.
- **Retire Expectations:** For expectations with upper bounds, use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to disable them once fulfilled.
- **Delegate to Fakes or Real Objects:** Use delegation patterns to combine mocks with real or fake implementations without duplicating logic.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Uninteresting Call Warnings:** Use `NiceMock` or specify `.Times(AnyNumber())` if you intend to ignore some method calls.
- **Unexpected Calls:** Review argument matchers and call order; unexpected calls mean your code is calling mocks in ways not described by your expectations.
- **Overlapping Expectations:** Remember GoogleMock selects the last matching expectation; order your `EXPECT_CALL`s with specificity in mind.
- **Mock Destructor Calls:** To test when a mock is destroyed, add a mock method like `Die()` and call it in the destructor.
- **Non-virtual Methods:** Only virtual methods can be mocked directly; for non-virtuals, consider interface extraction or template-based mocking.

---

## Summary

GoogleMock’s abstractions empower you to express your dependencies’ expected interactions concisely and powerfully. Through:

- **Controlled Mock Strictness** (`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, `StrictMock`),
- **Rich Call Expectations** (`EXPECT_CALL` with matchers, cardinalities, and order),
- **Flexible Mock Behaviors** (via `ON_CALL` and actions),

it gives you confidence that your tests capture interaction contracts clearly and precisely.
