# Assertions, Expectations, and Failure Handling in GoogleTest

Understanding assertions, expectations, and failure handling is crucial for writing expressive, maintainable tests using GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guide covers the foundational concepts behind these mechanisms, explains the difference between fatal and non-fatal failures, guides you through defining user assertions, introduces parameterized tests in this context, and clarifies error reporting. By harnessing GoogleTest's flexible and integrated assertion and expectation model, you'll write tests that clearly communicate intent and effectively detect defects.

## 1. Assertions and Their Role in Testing

Assertions are the core building blocks of any test: they express conditions you expect your code to satisfy at certain points in execution. When an assertion fails, it indicates a problem.

GoogleTest assertions come in two main flavors:

- **Fatal Failures:** These immediately abort the current test function. Use fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) when continuing execution would be meaningless or cause crashes.

- **Non-fatal Failures:** These record the failure but allow the test to continue. Use non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) to check multiple related conditions without aborting immediately.

### Practical Advice

Think of assertions as your test's checkpoints. For example, if verifying a critical return value, use a fatal assertion to stop early if it fails; if checking a series of related properties where you want to report all failures in one run, use non-fatal assertions.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MyFeatureTest, HandlesInvalidInput) {
  Foo foo;

  EXPECT_TRUE(foo.Initialize());  // Non-fatal: lets us see all init issues
  ASSERT_EQ(foo.GetState(), READY);  // Fatal if state not READY

  // Further test code assumes readiness
  EXPECT_EQ(foo.DoWork(), SUCCESS);
}
```

Always choose assertion types based on whether further test steps are meaningful on failure.

## 2. Expectations: Specifying Interactions with Mocks

When using GoogleMock, **expectations** describe how you expect your code to call mock methods. These verify interactions, such as method call count, argument values, and call order.

### Defining Expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`

Set expectations on mock objects by calling `EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(args))` before exercising the code.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;

MockTurtle turtle;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
    .WillOnce(Return(100))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(200));

Painter painter(&turtle);
EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
```

### Key Clauses for `EXPECT_CALL`

- `.Times(cardinality)`: Specifies expected number of calls. Supports `Exactly(n)`, `AtLeast(n)`, `AnyNumber()`, and more.

- `.WillOnce(action)` and `.WillRepeatedly(action)`: Define mock method’s behavior for calls.

- `.InSequence(sequences)`: Enforce call order across one or more sequences.

- `.After(expectations)`: Express that calls should happen after other expectations.

- `.RetiresOnSaturation()`: Marks expectation as inactive once call limit reached.

These clauses combine to define rich, precise behavior and ordering constraints.

---

## 3. Default Actions with `ON_CALL`

Unlike `EXPECT_CALL`, which asserts a call is expected, `ON_CALL` defines default behavior when the call occurs but is not explicitly expected.

Example usage:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, SomeMethod(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

This does not cause failures if the method is never called; it simply defines what happens when it is.

Use `ON_CALL` to specify typical mock behavior shared across tests, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for calls you want to verify.

---

## 4. Failure Handling and Reporting

GoogleMock distinguishes among the types of failures that can arise during mock invocation:

- **Uninteresting Calls:** Calls to mock methods for which no `EXPECT_CALL` has been set. By default, these trigger **warnings**, not failures, since the test did not explicitly restrict such calls.

- **Unexpected Calls:** Calls that match a method with set expectations, but don't satisfy any matching argument expectation. These are always **failures**.

- **Excessive Calls:** Calls made more times than expected by an `EXPECT_CALL` with bounded cardinality. These are also **failures**.

The failure messages include rich information to aid debugging:

- Function call signature and arguments
- The specific expectation that failed
- The file and line where the expectation was set
- Call counts and saturation status
- Matching attempts explanations

### Example Failure Output

```text
path/to/my_test.cc:45: Failure
Actual function call count doesn't match EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(3))...
     Expected: to be called twice
       Actual: called once - unsatisfied and active

Function call: Foo(3)
Call trace: ...
```

The verbosity of these messages can be controlled with the `--gmock_verbose` flag (`info`, `warning`, `error`). Use `info` for detailed diagnostic output.

---

## 5. Ordering Expectations: Sequences and Partial Orders

By default, expectations can match calls in any order. If your test requires calls in strict or partially ordered sequences, use:

- **`InSequence` Object:**

  Wrapping multiple `EXPECT_CALL`s within an `InSequence` scope requires calls to happen in the order defined.

  ```cpp
  {
    testing::InSequence seq;
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, Run());
  }
  ```

- **`Sequence` Objects with `.InSequence()`:**

  Build DAGs representing dependencies among expectations by assigning expectations to one or more `Sequence` objects.

- **`.After()` Clauses:**

  Specify that an expectation is only valid after one or more other expectations have been satisfied.

This powerful ordering control helps model complex interaction contracts precisely.

## 6. Parameterized Tests with Assertions and Expectations

While parameterized tests are not directly covered here, GoogleTest’s assertion and expectation model integrates seamlessly with parameterized test frameworks. Each parameterized test instance exercises assertions and expectations as normal.

Best practices include:

- Use non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) within parameterized tests to ensure all parameters are checked even upon failures.

- Define clear expectations per test instance when mocking.

Refer to the [Parameterized and Typed Tests guide](../core-testing-workflows/parameterized-and-typed-tests) for details.

---

## 7. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Set expectations before exercising mocks:** Always call `EXPECT_CALL` before code under test triggers mock calls. Changing expectations after calls start has undefined behavior.

- **Avoid overly strict expectations:** Specify only what is necessary to reduce brittleness.

- **Use catch-all expectations wisely:** Use `_` matcher with `.Times(AnyNumber())` to allow unspecified calls as needed.

- **Suppress uninteresting call warnings appropriately:** Use `NiceMock<T>` to silence uninteresting call warnings or explicitly specify `.Times(AnyNumber())`.

- **Retire expectations deliberately:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` when expectations should only apply a limited number of times.

- **Verify mock expectations before test ends:** Either rely on automatic verification on destruction or manually call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()` to catch unsatisfied expectations early.

- **Be cautious with side effects in actions:** Avoid easily misbehaving `WillOnce(Return(n++))` since the expression is evaluated once at expectation setup, not per invocation.

- **Use sequences and `.After()` to model call order carefully:** Over-constraining call order can yield fragile tests.

- **Handle leaks thoughtfully:** Leaking mocks causes expectations not to verify; use `Mock::AllowLeak()` if intentional.

## 8. Summary

GoogleTest’s assertions and GoogleMock’s expectations combine to form a comprehensive system that checks both outcomes and interactions. By strategically applying fatal and non-fatal assertions, setting clear expectations on mock objects with clauses for argument matching, call counts, and order, and understanding failure reporting, developers can craft robust tests that catch defects and clearly communicate behavior.
