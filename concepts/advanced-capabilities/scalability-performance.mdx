# Scalability and Performance

GoogleTest is engineered to deliver robust and efficient testing for C++ projects of all sizes. Understanding how it handles scalability and performance will empower you to design test suites that run swiftly and reliably, even as your codebase grows. This document breaks down key concepts like parallel test execution, memory management, and optimization strategies for both serial and parallel test runs.

---

## Why Scalability and Performance Matter

Imagine you're maintaining a large software project with hundreds or thousands of unit tests. Running tests sequentially can quickly become a bottleneck, delaying your development feedback cycle. Efficient scaling of tests accelerates development and maintains high code quality.

GoogleTest addresses these concerns by optimizing how tests are discovered, executed, and how resources are managed to keep runtimes low.

## Parallel Test Execution

### How It Works

GoogleTest supports parallel test execution, allowing multiple test binaries or test shards to run concurrently. This approach effectively utilizes multi-core processors to reduce total testing time.

- **Test Sharding:** You can divide your test suite into shards, each covering subsets of tests. Running shards in parallel across CPU cores or machines speeds up overall execution.
- **Concurrent Test Runs:** GoogleTest allows you to execute different test processes independently with filtering or sharding mechanisms.

### Typical User Workflow

1. **Divide your tests:** Use test sharding environment variables or command-line flags.
2. **Run shards concurrently:** Execute multiple test binaries or processes on isolated test shards.
3. **Aggregate results:** Collect output from all shards for a complete report.

### Optimization Tips

- Prefer **test sharding over thread-level parallelism**: GoogleTest inherently does not run tests in multiple threads within the same binary, but sharding enables parallelism across processes.
- Use filters smartly to isolate long-running or flaky tests.

<Tip>
Consider integrating GoogleTest's parallel execution capabilities with your CI system for automated, efficient test runs.

## Memory Management Strategies

### Minimal Runtime Footprint

GoogleTest is designed with a lightweight core to minimize the impact on your test execution environment.

- Test cases and fixtures are instantiated only as needed.
- Internal data structures optimize for low memory overhead across large test suites.

### Leak Detection

GoogleTest can detect leaks for mocks and other test objects to help maintain high-quality, memory-safe tests.

<Note>
Mock objects should have virtual destructors to avoid memory leaks during test teardown.
</Note>

### Practical Advice

- Avoid unnecessary global state or static objects that persist between tests.
- Use RAII patterns for test resource management.

---

## Runtime Optimization

### Serial Test Runs

While serial execution is straightforward, it can be slow for big codebases. However, GoogleTest is optimized to:

- Quickly find and run tests via command-line filters.
- Reduce startup time by efficiently initializing test environments.

### Parallel Test Runs

GoogleTest does not execute tests concurrently within a single binary by default. Instead:

- Run multiple test binaries in parallel to maximize CPU utilization.
- Use test sharding (`--gtest_shard_index` and `--gtest_total_shards`) to split execution.

### Tips for Faster Test Runs

- Run tests that are known to be slow or flaky separately to isolate their impact.
- Use `--gtest_filter` to run targeted subsets during development.
- Minimize test dependencies that can slow down startup or teardown.

<Warning>
Avoid running tests that depend on shared mutable global state in parallel without proper synchronization.
</Warning>

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Running in Parallel

> GoogleTest itself does not parallelize test execution inside a single process.
>
> **Solution:** Use test sharding or run multiple test binaries concurrently via your build or CI system.

### Memory Leak Warnings

> If you see warnings about leaked mock objects or test resources, ensure:
>
> - Destructors in mock base classes are `virtual`.
> - Objects are properly deleted or owned by RAII handlers.
>
> Use `Mock::AllowLeak(mock_object)` if intentional.

### Slow Test Execution

> Use filtering and sharding to isolate long-running tests and reduce overall runtime.
>
> Regularly review and refactor tests that perform heavy setup or teardown.

<Check>
Make sure your test binaries are compiled with optimizations and do not include unnecessary debug overhead for best performance.
</Check>

## Example: Running Tests in Parallel Using Sharding

```bash
# Assuming you have 4 shards, run these concurrently:
./my_test_binary --gtest_total_shards=4 --gtest_shard_index=0 &
./my_test_binary --gtest_total_shards=4 --gtest_shard_index=1 &
./my_test_binary --gtest_total_shards=4 --gtest_shard_index=2 &
./my_test_binary --gtest_total_shards=4 --gtest_shard_index=3 &
wait
```

This will divide your test suite into 4 roughly equal parts running in parallel.

## Troubleshooting Tip: Understanding Uninteresting Calls

When running large test suites, you may encounter warnings about uninteresting mock function calls. These indicate methods called on mocks without explicit expectations.

**How to Address:**

- Add appropriate `EXPECT_CALL` specifications for important interactions.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for calls you genuinely don't want to specify.
- Use `ON_CALL` to define default behaviors to avoid unexpected failures.

See [Mocking Reference - Nice, Strict, and Naggy](../../docs/reference/mocking#NiceStrictNaggy) for more.
