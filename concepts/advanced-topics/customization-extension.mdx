# Customization & Extension Points

Explore the conceptual model for extending GoogleTest through custom listeners, test environments, and user-defined predicates or matchers. Learn how the architecture supports community-driven features and integration with external systems.

## Introduction

GoogleTest offers a modular and extensible design, enabling users to tailor test behavior beyond standard assertions and test fixtures. This page focuses on the primary extension points that allow users to customize test behavior, monitoring, and verification to fit unique testing needs or integrate with external tools.

By understanding these extension mechanisms, users can achieve advanced verification scenarios, embed GoogleTest in complex test infrastructures, and enhance test diagnostics and reporting.


## Global and Per-Test Environments

### Purpose and Use Cases

Test environments represent setup and teardown logic that wraps around an entire test program or a subset of tests rather than an individual test case. Use them to:
- Initialize shared global state used by many tests.
- Allocate and release external resources (e.g., database connections).
- Configure logging or profiling around the full test suite.

### How to Define Test Environments

Users create environments by subclassing `::testing::Environment` and overriding:
- `SetUp()`: Code run once before any tests begin.
- `TearDown()`: Code run once after **all** tests have finished.

Example:

```cpp
class MyTestEnvironment : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize shared resources
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyTestEnvironment());
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Per-Test Setup and Teardown

Beyond global environments, GoogleTest supports defining setup/teardown at the test level using:
- **Test fixtures** (`TEST_F`) that provide test case-specific state.
- **Test event listeners** for hooking into the test lifecycle.


## Event Listeners: Monitoring Test Execution

### Concept

Event Listeners act as observers, receiving detailed notifications about the progress and results of test execution.

They enable applications to:
- Customize test output formatting (e.g., generate XML, JSON reports).
- Implement adaptive retries, resource monitoring, or selective test logging.
- Integrate with external CI/CD tools or dashboards.

### How Listeners Work

Listeners implement the `TestEventListener` interface, which receives callbacks corresponding to key events:
- Test program start and end
- Test iteration start and end
- Test case and individual test start and end
- Test assertion results

Listeners can be chained and registered with the GoogleTest framework.

### Usage Example

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting test: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished test: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::TestEventListeners& listeners =
      ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();
  listeners.Append(new MyListener);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Best Practices

- Base your listeners on `EmptyTestEventListener` to only override needed callbacks.
- Ensure thread-safety if your listener maintains shared state.
- Cleanly register and unregister listeners to avoid resource leaks.


## User-Defined Predicates and Matchers

GoogleTest supports extending test assertions by defining custom matchers and predicates.

### Why Define Custom Matchers?

- To express domain-specific conditions or constraints clearly.
- Improve failure messages with detailed and context-rich information.
- Reuse complex validation logic across tests.

### Defining Simple Matchers Using Macros

Use the `MATCHER` and `MATCHER_P(*)` macros for quick and concise matcher definitions.

Example:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "Checks if a number is even") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

// Usage in EXPECT_CALL or EXPECT_THAT
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsEven());
```

### Parameterized Matchers

Parameterized matchers accept arguments for added flexibility.

Example:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleBy, divisor, "Checks divisibility") {
  return (arg % divisor) == 0;
}

EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy(3));
```

### Implementing Advanced Matchers

For matchers that require complex logic or type behavior, implement the matcher interface classes.

Refer to the [Custom Assertions and Matchers](../api-reference/extending-configuration/custom-assertions-and-matchers.html) page for detailed examples.

### Using Predicates Directly

If you prefer, use the `Truly()` function to turn any unary predicate or functor into a matcher:

```cpp
bool IsPositive(int n) { return n > 0; }
EXPECT_THAT(value, Truly(IsPositive));
```


## Architecture Support for Extensions

The design of GoogleTest ensures that:
- Test environments, event listeners, and matchers coexist and can be layered.
- Extensions do not require modifying GoogleTest source code.
- Internal mechanisms provide hooks to allow user code to influence the test lifecycle and reporting.


## Integration with External Systems

These extension points empower users to:
- Connect test results to CI/CD pipelines.
- Produce custom test report formats for dashboards.
- Implement test filtering, telemetry, and dynamic test behavior.


## Troubleshooting and FAQs

- **Q:** How to ensure my custom listener does not interfere with others?

  **A:** Use the listener chaining APIs properly and avoid assumptions about listener order.

- **Q:** Can matchers have side effects?

  **A:** No. Matchers must be pure predicates without side effects because GoogleTest may invoke them multiple times or out-of-order.

- **Q:** How to debug complex matcher failures?

  **A:** Stream helpful diagnostics to the `MatchResultListener` inside `MatchAndExplain` or your `MATCHER` macros.
