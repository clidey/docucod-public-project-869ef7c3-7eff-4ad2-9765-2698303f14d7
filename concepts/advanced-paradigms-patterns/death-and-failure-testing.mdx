# Death Test and Failure Handling Paradigms

GoogleTest equips developers with powerful tools for verifying code robustness in failure scenarios, including tests that expect program termination—*death tests*—and nuanced handling of assertion outcomes. This guide reveals how GoogleTest manages fatal and non-fatal failures in test execution, the architecture behind death tests, and best practices for employing these techniques to assert your program behaves correctly even under error conditions.

---

## Understanding Failure Handling in GoogleTest

GoogleTest categorizes test assertions and failures based on their impact on control flow and test execution:

- **Fatal Failures:** Triggered by `ASSERT_*` macros and `FAIL()`. They abort the current function, preventing subsequent lines from executing. Fatal failures cause the immediate termination of the test function.
- **Non-Fatal Failures:** Triggered by `EXPECT_*` macros and `ADD_FAILURE()`. They report failures but allow the test to continue executing.

This distinction enables flexible test design where some conditions require immediate abort to prevent invalid state or crashes, and others allow continued checking for multiple issues within a single run.

### Propagation of Fatal Failures

A common pitfall is misunderstanding that fatal assertions abort *only* the current function, not the entire test. Consider:

```cpp
void Subroutine() {
  ASSERT_EQ(1, 2);  // Fatal failure aborts this function only
  // Code here won't execute
}

TEST(ExampleTest, FailurePropagation) {
  Subroutine();  // Control returns here despite failure
  int* ptr = nullptr;
  *ptr = 42;  // Unsafe: may cause crash after failure
}
```

GoogleTest provides tools to handle this situation:

- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement);` or `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement);` to verify that no fatal failures occur within `statement`.
- Use `HasFatalFailure()` to check if a fatal failure has occurred and return or abort as needed.
- Use exception-throwing event listeners to convert fatal failures into exceptions for easier propagation.


<Steps>
<Step title="Using ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE">
Wrap subroutine calls to ensure no fatal failures occur:

```cpp
ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(Subroutine());
```
</Step>
<Step title="Checking for Fatal Failures Explicitly">
Check with `HasFatalFailure()`:

```cpp
Subroutine();
if (HasFatalFailure()) return;  // Abort early if failed
```
</Step>
<Step title="Turning Fatal Failures into Exceptions">
Implement a test event listener to throw exceptions on fatal failures for better flow control.

## Death Tests: Validating Crash and Exit Conditions

Death tests in GoogleTest are the mechanism for verifying that specific pieces of code cause the process to terminate in a controlled, expected manner. This is critical for validating error handling paths, assertions, or deliberate fatal exits.

### What Are Death Tests?

- Death tests check that executing a statement causes the program to terminate (i.e., crash, exit, or signal).
- They run the tested code in a child process to isolate fatal outcomes without crashing the entire test runner.
- GoogleTest provides macros like `EXPECT_DEATH()`, `ASSERT_DEATH()`, `EXPECT_EXIT()`, and `ASSERT_EXIT()` for crafting such tests.

### Typical Use Cases

- Validating that assertion checks trigger process termination when preconditions fail.
- Testing code paths designed to abort or call fatal logging macros under error scenarios.
- Ensuring that signals or abnormal exits occur under specific conditions.

### Writing a Death Test

Example of checking that a function invokes a fatal exit with a specific error message:

```cpp
TEST(FooDeathTest, CrashOnBadInput) {
  ASSERT_DEATH({
    int* ptr = nullptr;
    *ptr = 42;
  }, "Segmentation fault");
}

TEST(FooDeathTest, ExitsWithCodeZero) {
  EXPECT_EXIT(std::exit(0), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "");
}
```

### Death Test Macros Overview

| Macro                 | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ASSERT_DEATH(stmt, regex)`      | Fails the test fatally if `stmt` does not cause termination with stderr matching `regex`.       |
| `EXPECT_DEATH(stmt, regex)`      | Continues execution on failure but reports non-fatal failure on unexpected behavior.           |
| `ASSERT_EXIT(stmt, pred, regex)` | Checks exit status via predicate (e.g., exit code or signal) and stderr output.                |
| `EXPECT_EXIT(stmt, pred, regex)` | Like `ASSERT_EXIT`, but non-fatal failure on discrepancy.                                     |

### Key Parameters

- **statement:** Arbitrary C++ statements to test for termination.
- **matcher/regex:** String or matcher applied to stderr output to verify expected error message.
- **predicate:** A callable or functor applied to exit code or signal (used in `_EXIT` macros).

### Handling Death Test Styles

GoogleTest supports two primary styles of death tests to accommodate threading and platform differences:

- **Fast Style:** Forks a child process and immediately runs the death test code. Faster but assumes a single-threaded environment.
- **Threadsafe Style:** Forks and *re-executes* the test binary in the child, running only the specific death test with flags set. Safer for multi-threaded environments but slower.

You can set the style programmatically or via the flag `--gtest_death_test_style`:

```cpp
GTEST_FLAG_SET(death_test_style, "threadsafe");
```

### Internal Mechanics

Under the hood, death tests:

1. Detect if multiple threads are active and warn because forking is unsafe with threads.
2. Fork or clone a child process to isolate the death test execution.
3. In threadsafe style, re-executes the binary with filters to run only the target death test.
4. Capture standard error output for regex matching.
5. Wait for the child process to terminate and verify exit codes/signals.
6. Report success only if all conditions match; otherwise, provide detailed failure messages.

## Assertion Outcomes in Depth

GoogleTest categorizes assertion failures for rich test output and behavior:

| Failure Type     | Generated By     | Effect on Execution                      |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Fatal Failure    | `ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`  | Aborts current function immediately     |
| Non-Fatal Failure | `EXPECT_*`, `ADD_FAILURE()` | Continue test execution but marks test as failed |

### Explicit Success and Failure

- `SUCCEED()` indicates an explicit success but does not affect overall pass/fail.
- `FAIL()` aborts current void function with a fatal failure.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` reports a non-fatal failure and continues.

### Customizing Failure Messages

All assertions support streaming custom messages:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition) << "Failed because of value: " << value;
```

This enriches diagnostics and debugging efficiency.

## Practical Tips & Common Pitfalls

- **Only use death tests to check for process termination.** Exceptions are better tested with exception assertions.
- **Avoid multiple death assertions on the same line;** this causes compilation errors.
- **Keep death test statements idempotent and do not leak resources;** child process side effects are isolated.
- When writing death tests involving mocks, **allow mock leaks** using `Mock::AllowLeak()` to avoid interference.
- Name your death test suites with the suffix `DeathTest` to ensure they run before other tests, mitigating threading issues.

---

## Example Death Test

```cpp
TEST(ExampleDeathTest, DiesOnNullPointer) {
  EXPECT_DEATH({
    int* p = nullptr;
    *p = 100;
  }, "null pointer");
}

TEST(ExampleDeathTest, ExitsWithZero) {
  EXPECT_EXIT(std::exit(0), testing::ExitedWithCode(0), "");
}
```

These tests verify the program reacts appropriately by crashing or exiting with expected codes and messages.

## Summary

In summary, the `Death Test and Failure Handling Paradigms` page equips you to rigorously test the stability of your code by verifying that error paths produce expected fatal conditions. Understanding the difference between fatal and non-fatal failures helps you control test flow precisely, while death tests provide a robust framework for testing process-level termination scenarios.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Death tests fail when multiple threads are active:** Use `threadsafe` style or refactor to single-thread context.
- **Death tests compile errors with multiple assertions on one line:** Split into separate statements.
- **Mismatch between expected and actual exit codes or messages:** Verify the predicate and regex correctly reflect your process behavior.
- **Tests silently pass despite expected failure:** Confirm assertions are fatal or use `ASSERT_*` for fatal failures.

<Callout>
Note: Always execute death test statements with minimal side-effects. They run in isolated child processes, so resource deallocation may not propagate to the parent, potentially causing false positives in resource leak detection.
