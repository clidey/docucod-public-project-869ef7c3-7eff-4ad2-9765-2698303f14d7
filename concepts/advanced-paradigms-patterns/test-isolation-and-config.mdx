# Test Isolation and Configuration

Efficient and reliable testing hinges on the ability to isolate tests from one another and maintain deterministic execution environments. This page guides you through strategies and mechanisms to isolate GoogleTest-based tests, control the test environment, and configure test execution parameters. By mastering these concepts, you ensure that your test runs remain consistent, reproducible, and easy to debug.

## Understanding Test Isolation

Test isolation means that the outcome of a test does not depend on the behavior, state, or side effects of other tests. GoogleTest achieves isolation primarily by running each test in a fresh test fixture instance and encouraging clean setup and teardown practices.

### How GoogleTest Enforces Isolation

- **Fresh Fixture Instances:** Each test is executed on its own instance of the test fixture class, ensuring separate member states.
- **Separate Setup and Teardown:** The `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods run before and after each test respectively, allowing precise control of per-test environment.
- **Test Suite Setup:** For expensive shared resources, `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` methods let you initialize and cleanup once per suite while still maintaining individual test isolation.

### Best Practices for Test Isolation

- Keep side effects localized and cleaned up within `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.
- Avoid sharing mutable global state unless it is carefully controlled and reset.
- Use mocks or fakes to replace dependencies that are slow, unreliable, or non-deterministic.

<Tip>
If you find tests failing intermittently or influencing each other, review your fixtures' setup/teardown and consider applying mocking strategies to isolate dependencies.
</Tip>

## Controlling the Test Environment

GoogleTest provides mechanisms to set up and tear down global environments that affect the entire test program, giving you control over shared resources or external dependencies.

### Global Test Environments

- Define a subclass of `testing::Environment` overriding `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for global setup/cleanup.
- Register it before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` using `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()`.
- Multiple environments can be registered; GoogleTest calls `SetUp()` in registration order, `TearDown()` in reverse.

Example:

```cpp
class MyGlobalEnv : public testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize database connection or similar
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup database
  }
};

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyGlobalEnv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This approach allows costly initializations once across many tests without sacrificing per-test isolation.

### Per-Test and Per-TestSuite Configuration

#### Per-Test Setup (`SetUp()`) and TearDown (`TearDown()`)
Called before and after *each* test method in a fixture, managing test-specific state.

#### Per-TestSuite Setup (`SetUpTestSuite()`) and TearDown (`TearDownTestSuite()`)
Called once before the first test and after the last test respectively for shared resource management.

<Note>
Be careful with static members used as shared resources to avoid state leaks between tests.
</Note>

## Configuring Test Execution

GoogleTest uses a set of flags and options to customize test execution, helping create deterministic and reliable runs.

### Key Flags and Options

| Flag Name                            | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_repeat`                   | Number of times to repeat all tests                       |
| `--gtest_shuffle`                  | Randomizes the order tests run                            |
| `--gtest_random_seed`              | Sets seed for test shuffling                              |
| `--gtest_filter`                   | Runs only tests matching the filter pattern               |
| `--gtest_fail_fast`                | Stops execution on first failure                          |
| `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` | Includes disabled tests in execution                      |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`         | Breaks into debugger upon failure                         |

You must call `testing::InitGoogleTest()` in `main()` to parse these flags.

<Info>
Flags from environment variables take precedence over command-line if not explicitly set.
</Info>

### Determinism and Reproducibility

- **Repetition and Shuffling:** You can repeat the full test suite multiple times with different randomized orders to uncover flaky tests or unexpected dependencies.
- **Random Seed Control:** Retrieving and fixing the random seed reported after a run lets you reproduce failures consistently.

### Environment Set-Up and Tear-Down When Repeating Tests

Flag `--gtest_recreate_environments_when_repeating` controls whether global environments are recreated for every iteration:

- `true` (default): Environments set up and torn down each iteration.
- `false`: Set up once before first iteration, tear down after last iteration.

This can improve performance but make global resources persist longer.

## Managing Test Properties and Metadata

You can annotate test runs with key-value pairs via `RecordProperty()`, enabling richer reports.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(FooTest, MyTest) {
  testing::Test::RecordProperty("Iteration", "42");
  ...
}
```

Properties set in tests will appear in XML or JSON reports, associated with the respective test case.

## Controlling Uninteresting Calls in Mocks

GoogleMock provides three strictness wrappers to control the handling of unexpected or uninteresting mock calls:

| Wrapper       | Behavior                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock<T>` | Suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls                      |
| `NaggyMock<T>`| Prints warnings on uninteresting calls (default mock behavior)  |
| `StrictMock<T>`| Treats uninteresting calls as failures (test fails)             |

Choose based on how strictly you want to verify interactions in your tests:

- Use `NiceMock` for relaxed, less noisy tests
- Use `NaggyMock` during development or debugging
- Use `StrictMock` for enforcing precise call validation

<Tip>
Be cautious with strict mocks: refactoring code without behavior changes may require changing tests.
</Tip>

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

- **Leaked Mocks:** If you dynamically allocate mocks and don't delete them, GoogleMock cannot verify expectations. Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to suppress leak warnings.
- **Sticky Expectations:** Expectations persist after being saturated unless `.RetiresOnSaturation()` is used or the expectation is placed in a sequence.
- **Uninitialized Test Environments:** Environments must be registered before test execution.
- **Flag Parsing:** Always call `InitGoogleTest()` early in your program to ensure flags are processed correctly.

## Example: Running Tests with Custom Configuration

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::FLAGS_gtest_repeat = 10;         // Run tests 10 times
  ::testing::FLAGS_gtest_shuffle = true;      // Shuffle test execution order
  ::testing::FLAGS_gtest_filter = "MySuite.*"; // Run tests matching pattern

  testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnv); // Add global environment

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This configuration facilitates repeated, randomized, and filtered test runs with global environment setup.
