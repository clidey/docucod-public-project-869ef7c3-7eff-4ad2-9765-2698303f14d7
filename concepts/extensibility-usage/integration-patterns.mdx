# Integration Patterns and Test Runner Options

Explore common integration patterns, including using GoogleTest with build systems and CI tools, and the available options for running or customizing test execution and reporting.

## Introduction

Successful integration of GoogleTest into your development workflow involves understanding how to incorporate it within your build systems, continuous integration (CI) pipelines, and how to control test execution and reporting. This page focuses specifically on common integration patterns and the options available when running your tests.

As you begin or extend your use of GoogleTest, mastering these concepts empowers you to automate testing effectively, generate useful reports, and tailor test execution to fit project needs.


## Common Integration Patterns

Integration patterns describe typical ways GoogleTest is embedded into projects and CI environments. These patterns emphasize seamless build and test cycles, clear feedback, and maintainable workflows.

### 1. Integration with Build Systems

GoogleTest can be integrated into various build systems such as CMake, Bazel, or Make. Typical workflows involve:

- Adding test sources and linking against GoogleTest libraries
- Defining test targets that build test executables
- Configuring build dependencies to ensure proper compilation and linking order

Integrating GoogleTest this way enables you to build test binaries alongside your application code, facilitating easy test execution.

### 2. Use within Continuous Integration Pipelines

Automating test runs within CI systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) involves:

- Building test binaries as part of the CI build step
- Running tests automatically and capturing their output
- Generating machine-readable reports for test successes or failures

GoogleTest supports common test report formats like XML, which most CI tools can parse to display test results and provide actionable feedback.

### 3. Test Execution in Isolation or Combined Runs

You can run tests individually, by test suite, or all together. Integration can include:

- Test filtering by name or category using GoogleTest flags
- Running tests with options to control output verbosity or colorization
- Integration with debuggers or IDEs to run or step through tests interactively

This flexibility aids in focused debugging and efficient test iteration.


## Options for Running Tests

GoogleTest provides rich options that influence how tests are executed and how results are presented. These options can be passed as command-line flags to your test binaries.

### Common Test Runner Flags

| Flag                               | Description                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `--gtest_filter`                  | Run only tests matching the filter pattern.   |
| `--gtest_repeat`                  | Run tests repeatedly for specified count.     |
| `--gtest_shuffle`                 | Randomize test execution order.                |
| `--gtest_output=xml[:path]`       | Produce XML report output, optionally to file. |
| `--gtest_color`                  | Control color output: `yes`, `no`, or `auto`. |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure`       | Break into debugger on test failures.         |
| `--gtest_throw_on_failure`       | Throw exceptions on failures instead of asserting. |

These flags help you design test sessions tailored to your goals, be it debugging, regression testing, or integration checks.

### Controlling Logging and Verbosity

GoogleTest and GoogleMock support varying levels of verbosity and can emit detailed logs:

- Use the `--gmock_verbose=[info|warning|error]` flag to control the amount of output from mocks, such as warnings on unexpected calls or informational traces.

- Stack trace depth and output format can be controlled to adjust the detail level of failure diagnostics.


## Customizing Test Execution

Advanced users may want to customize test execution further:

- Implement custom event listeners for test lifecycle hooks to integrate with dashboards or log sinks
- Use environment setup and teardown classes to manage global resources or configure global test state
- Combine `InSequence` and `Sequence` constructs to enforce call order expectations within mocks

These techniques enable fine control over the testing environment and outcome reporting.


## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

- **Test binaries not found or not running:** Ensure build system correctly compiles and links GoogleTest
- **Tests not discovered:** Check test naming conventions and use `--gtest_filter` properly
- **CI test reports not parsed:** Verify XML output path and format compatible with CI system
- **Verbose output too noisy:** Adjust verbosity flags like `--gmock_verbose` or `--gtest_filter` to focus on relevant data

Refer to the [Integration Troubleshooting FAQ](../../faq/troubleshooting-advanced/integration-issues.md) for detailed guidance.


## Sample User Flow: Integrating GoogleTest with Build and CI

1. Add GoogleTest and GoogleMock as dependencies in your build scripts (CMakeLists.txt or BUILD files).
2. Define test executables with source files and required linking.
3. Ensure tests build successfully and run locally.
4. Configure CI system to build these targets during pipeline execution.
5. Add command-line flags to tests in CI to enable XML reports and filtering to relevant tests.
6. Observe CI test results and iterate based on success/failure feedback.


## Best Practices for Integration

- Use `ON_CALL` to define default mock behaviors shared across tests, reserving `EXPECT_CALL` for actual assertions.
- Leverage sequences and partial order (`InSequence` and `After`) to define expected call orders clearly.
- Use `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` variants to control test behavior for uninteresting calls depending on test strictness needs.
- Run tests with `--gmock_verbose=info` to diagnose mismatched mocks or unexpected calls.
- Use test filters (`--gtest_filter`) to isolate problematic tests during development.
