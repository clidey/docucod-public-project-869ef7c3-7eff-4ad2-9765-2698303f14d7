# Performance and Scalability Considerations

GoogleTest is designed to handle large test suites efficiently, enabling developers to maintain fast feedback cycles even as projects grow. This page explores key strategies and features that ensure your tests run swiftly, reliably, and in a maintainable way.

## Parallel Test Execution

Running tests in parallel across multiple CPU cores or machines is the most effective way to reduce overall test runtime.

- **Built-in Parallel Support:** GoogleTest supports parallel test execution by running multiple test binaries concurrently. This can be orchestrated via your build system or CI pipeline.

- **Sharding:** You can divide tests into shard sets and run each shard in parallel, typically configured via environment variables like `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` and `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Ensure tests are independent and do not share state or global resources that lead to race conditions.
  - Avoid relying on fixed ordering of test execution, as parallelism may cause tests to run in any order.
  - Use proper synchronization or avoid shared mutable state in test fixtures.

## Test Filtering and Selection

With large test suites, running every test all the time is inefficient. GoogleTest’s filtering capabilities allow selective execution.

- **Test Filtering Syntax:** Use the flag `--gtest_filter=` to specify which tests or test suites to run.

- **Positive and Negative Filters:**
  - Include only specific tests: `--gtest_filter=FooTest.*` runs all tests in `FooTest`.
  - Exclude tests: `--gtest_filter=-*SlowTest*` excludes tests with "SlowTest" in their name.

- **Test Lists:** Use lists of test names or patterns to target tests related to recent changes or critical functionality.

- **Integrations:** Test selection can be automated in CI using code coverage or test impact analysis tools.

## Test Suite Organization

Well-structured test suites contribute greatly to performance and maintainability.

- Group related tests into test suites and fixtures to enable parallelization at suite granularity.
- Avoid overly large test fixtures that introduce unnecessary setup cost.
- Isolate slow or resource-intensive tests into separate suites so they can be run less frequently or in parallel slots specialized for them.

## Incremental and Cached Test Results

When supported by your build and test environment, incremental testing and test result caching help reduce unnecessary execution.

- **Incremental Testing:** Run only tests impacted by recent code changes.
- **Result Caching:** Skip tests with known stable results unless affected code or dependencies change.
- These strategies must be supported by your test orchestration and CI tooling and comply with GoogleTest’s conventions.

## Test Execution Environment

Optimizing the runtime environment improves consistency and speed.

- Run tests in clean, isolated environments to avoid interference.
- Use memory and resource monitoring to detect leaks or bottlenecks.
- Prefer local SSDs or fast storage for temporary test data.

## Memory and Resource Usage

Large test suites can stress system resources.

- Use GoogleTest’s heap checker and sanitizer integrations to catch leaks early.
- Monitor CPU and memory usage of tests to identify inefficient or runaway tests.
- Consider splitting resource-heavy tests or refactoring them.

## Build and Compilation Optimization

Optimizing how your tests are built influences testing speed aspects beyond execution.

- Keep mock classes and test sources modular to reduce compilation times.
- Move mock class constructors/destructors out of the header into `.cc` files when compilation times become excessive.
- Use precompiled headers and incremental build tools supported by your compiler.

## Best Practices for Scalability

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress unnecessary warnings on uninteresting calls, reducing clutter and improving test performance.
- Avoid overly strict mocks (`StrictMock`) unless necessary to prevent brittle tests.
- Write deterministic tests that avoid flaky or timing-dependent failures.
- Use test fixtures with minimal setup to speed up individual test execution.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

- Profile test runs using built-in tools or external profilers to identify slow tests.
- Use GoogleTest’s verbose flags (`--gtest_print_time`) to profile individual test durations.
- Disable or isolate flaky tests that introduce variability in test suite performance.

### Example: Running Tests in Parallel with Sharding

```bash
# Run the entire test suite sharded into 4 parts on separate machines or processes.
GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 \
GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0 \
./my_tests

GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4 \
GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1 \
./my_tests

# And so on for indices 2 and 3...
```

This setup reduces execution time approximately by the number of shards.
