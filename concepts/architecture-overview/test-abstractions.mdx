# Test Cases, Suites & Fixtures

Understanding how to organize and structure your tests is fundamental for maintaining clear, reliable, and scalable test code. GoogleTest provides several key abstractions to manage this: **test cases**, **test suites**, and **test fixtures**. These abstractions help you encapsulate behavior, group related tests, and manage shared setup and tear-down, making your tests easier to write and maintain.

---

## What Is a Test Case / Test Suite?

A **test case**—now more commonly called a **test suite**—is a collection of related tests that share a common goal, such as testing a particular class or module. Grouping tests this way helps you organize your code meaningfully, reflecting the structure of the software under test.

> _Note_: The terminology has evolved. Historically, GoogleTest called this grouping a "test case," but current usage favors "test suite." Both refer to the same concept. 

### Why Use Test Suites?

- **Organization**: Logically group related tests together.
- **Shared Setup**: Enable shared configuration and resources.
- **Easier Execution**: Run all tests in a suite or selectively focus on one.

---

## Understanding Test Fixtures

Test fixtures enable you to reuse the same configuration or setup among multiple tests to avoid repetition and ensure consistency.

### What Is a Test Fixture?

A test fixture is a C++ class derived from `testing::Test` that encapsulates data members and setup/tear-down operations shared among tests within a test suite.

They ensure that each test runs with a fresh instance of the fixture, isolated from side effects of other tests.

### Benefits of Using Test Fixtures

- **Reusability**: Avoid duplicating setup code across tests.
- **Isolation**: Each test gets a clean instance, preventing cross-test pollution.
- **Clarity**: Group related test data and helpers in one place.

---

## How Test Cases, Suites, and Fixtures Work Together

When you write tests, here’s how these concepts interplay:

1. **Define a Test Fixture Class**:
   - Derive a class from `testing::Test`.
   - Declare shared objects or data members.
   - Optionally implement `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for per-test setup and cleanup.

2. **Write Individual Tests Using the Fixture (`TEST_F`)**:
   - Use the `TEST_F` macro to define tests that use the fixture.
   - Each test will run on a fresh fixture instance.

3. **Run the Tests in the Suite/Test Case**:
   - GoogleTest automatically groups tests sharing the same fixture class into the same test suite.

This pattern enables clean, maintainable testing code where you can iterate quickly without rewriting boilerplate.

## Example: Testing a Queue Class

Suppose you want to test the behavior of a simple `Queue` class. Here’s how you can structure your tests with fixtures:

```cpp
// The class under test.
template <typename E>
class Queue {
 public:
  Queue() {}
  void Enqueue(const E& element) { ... }
  E* Dequeue() { ... }  // Returns nullptr if empty
  size_t size() const { ... }
  ...
};

// Define the test fixture.
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Setup common states for tests
    // q0_ is empty
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  // Queues used by multiple tests
  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

// Tests that q0_ is initially empty.
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

// Tests dequeue behavior
TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q0_.Dequeue();
  EXPECT_EQ(n, nullptr);

  n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  EXPECT_EQ(q1_.size(), 0);
  delete n;

  n = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 2);
  EXPECT_EQ(q2_.size(), 1);
  delete n;
}
```

In this example:

- The fixture `QueueTest` defines multiple queue instances for different scenarios.
- Each test defined with `TEST_F` runs independently with a fresh fixture instance.
- Setup logic is centralized, avoiding repetition.

---

## Best Practices When Using Test Fixtures

- **Use fixtures to reduce repeated code**: Extract common setup into fixtures rather than duplicating it in tests.
- **Each test gets a fresh fixture instance**: Avoid shared mutable state between tests to keep tests independent.
- **Declare shared resources as fixture members**: Use fixture member variables to hold objects needed across tests.
- **Implement `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` for complex initialization/cleanup**: Especially if setup is expensive or involves external resources.
- **Name your fixture class thoughtfully**: It usually corresponds to the class or component being tested.
- **Use `TEST_F` for fixture-based tests**: Different from simple `TEST` which does not use fixtures.

---

## Test Fixture Lifecycle

Each test invokation follows this sequence internally:

1. GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance.
2. Calls constructor of the fixture.
3. Calls `SetUp()` method.
4. Runs the test body.
5. Calls `TearDown()` method.
6. Destroys the fixture instance.

This cycle guarantees isolation between tests.

---

## Per-Test Suite Setup and Teardown

In case you need to share expensive resources across all tests in a suite, use:

- `static void SetUpTestSuite()`
- `static void TearDownTestSuite()`

These static methods are called once before the first test and once after the last test in the suite respectively.

Example:

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* FooTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

Use these cautiously, as tests should ideally be independent and not rely on shared state that may introduce subtle bugs.

## Summary

Test Cases (Test Suites), Fixtures, and Tests are core abstractions in GoogleTest to build organized, reusable, and isolated test structures:

| Concept     | Definition                                                                         | Usage                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Test Case / Test Suite | A collection of related tests, often corresponding to a class or module.           | Group tests logically in your test reports.|
| Test Fixture | A class inheriting from `testing::Test` encapsulating shared test data and setup.| Reuse setup/teardown code, keep tests DRY. |
| TEST macro  | Defines a simple test without a fixture.                                           | For standalone simple tests.                |
| TEST_F macro| Defines a test using a test fixture.                                              | For tests needing shared setup/teardown.   |

Leveraging these will empower you to write maintainable and scalable tests with clear structure that directly reflects your software design.

## Troubleshooting Common Test Fixture Issues

<Accordion title="Fixture Not Being Invoked or Used Correctly">
Make sure you use `TEST_F` instead of `TEST` when writing tests that use a fixture. `TEST` defines tests without binding to fixtures, so fixture setup/teardown will be skipped.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Shared Mutable State Leads to Test Failures or Flakiness">
Avoid sharing mutable objects across tests unless absolutely necessary. Use per-test fresh instances and restore shared resource state if modified.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Misnamed Setup Functions Leading to Setup Not Called">
`SetUp()` has a capital `U`. Using `Setup()` (lowercase `u`) will silently cause the method to not be called by GoogleTest.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Test Suites from One Fixture Class">
You can define multiple test suites using different fixture classes or parameterized tests. Avoid excessive coupling to one fixture for diverse test scenarios.
