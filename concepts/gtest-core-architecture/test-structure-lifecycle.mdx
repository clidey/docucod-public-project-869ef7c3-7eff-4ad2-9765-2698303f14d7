# Test Structure and Lifecycle

Understanding how GoogleTest discovers, registers, and executes tests is essential for designing reliable and maintainable test suites. This page lays out the core concepts behind test organization, the lifecycle of tests, and how different test types are managed, enabling you to leverage GoogleTest effectively in your C++ projects.

---

## 1. Overview of Test Components and Organization

GoogleTest structures your test program into hierarchical components with clear roles:

- **Test Program**: The executable that runs all tests.
- **Test Suites**: Groups of related tests that share a common fixture or purpose.
- **Tests**: Individual checks within test suites, each containing assertions.
- **Test Fixtures**: Classes derived from `testing::Test` that encapsulate shared setup and teardown logic for tests within a suite.

This organization reflects typical software structures, making your tests easier to understand, navigate, and maintain.

### 1.1 Tests and Test Suites
- A **test** is a single entity verifying a particular behavior or outcome.
- A **test suite** is a collection of tests that usually share the same test fixture class.

**Naming rules:**
- Both test suite and test names must be valid C++ identifiers and should avoid underscores (`_`), as they may interfere with GoogleTest’s internal naming and reporting.

### Example: Defining a Simple Test Suite and Test
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesPositiveInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(3), 6);
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(5), 120);
}
```

This defines two tests `HandlesZeroInput` and `HandlesPositiveInput` within the `FactorialTest` suite.

---

## 2. Test Fixtures and Reusable Setup

Test fixtures are classes that provide common context for all tests in a suite. They are derived from `testing::Test` and can include member variables and setup/teardown code.

### 2.1 Lifecycle of a Test Fixture
For each test:

1. A **fresh test fixture object** is created.
2. The **constructor** runs, initializing the fixture.
3. `SetUp()` is called to perform further initialization.
4. The test body (code in `TEST_F`) runs.
5. `TearDown()` is called to clean up.
6. The destructor runs and the fixture object is deleted.

Because a new fixture instance is created per test, tests remain isolated and independent.

### Example: Using a Test Fixture
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Setup initial queues
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

## 3. Types of Tests and Their Lifecycles

GoogleTest supports multiple test types, each with nuances in registration and execution.

### 3.1 Simple Tests (`TEST`)
- They do not use fixtures.
- Defined with `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro.
- Each test is an independent function.

### 3.2 Fixture-Based Tests (`TEST_F`)
- Use a test fixture for shared setup.
- Defined with `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`.
- Fixture lifecycle applies as described.

### 3.3 Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)
- Run the same test logic with different parameter values.
- Fixture class must derive from `testing::TestWithParam<T>`.
- Tests defined with `TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`.
- Requires instantiation via `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.

### 3.4 Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)
- Run the same tests across different types.
- Fixture is a template class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Define tests with `TYPED_TEST(TestFixtureName, TestName)`.
- Type list is registered using `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`.

### 3.5 Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_P`)
- Like typed tests but allow separate registration and instantiation.
- Useful for abstract test suites.

### Summary Table
| Test Type            | Macro           | Uses Fixture         | Parameter Type         | Instantiation Required |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Simple Test          | `TEST`          | No                  | N/A                   | No                     |
| Fixture-Based Test   | `TEST_F`        | Yes                 | N/A                   | No                     |
| Value-Parameterized  | `TEST_P`        | Yes                 | Value parameter `T`   | Yes                    |
| Typed Test           | `TYPED_TEST`    | Yes (templated)      | Type parameter `T`    | Yes                    |
| Type-Parameterized   | `TYPED_TEST_P`  | Yes (templated)      | Type parameter `T`    | Yes                    |

## 4. Test Discovery and Registration

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests defined with the `TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, and related macros at runtime by registering them upon program start. This eliminates the need for you to manually list or call tests.

- Each test registers a `TestInfo` object with the framework.
- The `UnitTest` singleton manages collections of registered tests.
- At runtime, `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` invokes all registered tests that match filters.

This automated approach provides:

- Seamless integration with build and CI systems.
- Ability to filter and select tests by suite or test name.
- Support for disabled tests (marked with the `DISABLED_` prefix).

---

## 5. Test Execution Lifecycle

Understanding the steps of test execution helps in designing tests that run efficiently and reliably.

### 5.1 High-Level Flow

When you call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`:

1. **Initialization**
   - Flags are processed (such as test filters).
   - Global test environments (`testing::Environment`) are set up.

2. **Test Suite Setup**
   - For each test suite that should run, `SetUpTestSuite()` is called once.

3. **Test Execution**
   - For each test in the suite:
     - A fresh fixture instance is created.
     - `SetUp()` is called.
     - The test body runs.
     - `TearDown()` is called.
     - The fixture is destroyed.
     - Failures are recorded but execution continues unless fatal failures occur.

4. **Test Suite Teardown**
   - After all tests in a suite run, `TearDownTestSuite()` is called.

5. **Global Environment Teardown**
   - Registered global environments are torn down in reverse order.

6. **Reporting**
   - Status and results are printed to console or exported as XML/JSON if requested.

### 5.2 Handling Fatal Failures

- Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) abort the current function.
- GoogleTest does not abort the entire test suite on a fatal failure in a single test.
- This behavior ensures that other tests are still executed.

### 5.3 Skipping Tests at Runtime

Using `GTEST_SKIP()`, tests can be skipped during execution based on runtime conditions, for example, if prerequisites aren’t met.

---

## 6. Sharing Resources Across Tests

Repeatedly creating expensive resources can slow down testing. GoogleTest provides mechanisms for sharing resources safely.

### 6.1 Per-Test Setup/Teardown
- Use constructor, `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, and destructor for per-test setup.
- Each test gets a fresh environment, ensuring independence.

### 6.2 Per-Test-Suite Setup/Teardown
- Define static member variables in your fixture class to hold shared resources.
- Override static methods `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to initialize and clean up shared resources once per suite.

Example:
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new ExpensiveResource();
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }

  static ExpensiveResource* shared_resource_;
};

ExpensiveResource* FooTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

### 6.3 Global Environment Setup/Teardown

- Subclass `testing::Environment` to define global contexts shared across multiple test suites.
- Register with `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` before tests run.

Useful for one-time initialization and cleanup that spans the entire test program, such as initializing logging or database connections.

## 7. Advanced Features Touchpoint

GoogleTest supports sophisticated scenarios handled by specific APIs:

- **Parameterized and Typed Tests:** Run tests systematically over a range of values or types.
- **Death Tests:** Verify behavior when code crashes or exits.
- **Custom Test Registration:** Dynamically register tests programmatically.
- **Event Listeners:** Extend test execution monitoring and reporting.

These are documented in dedicated guides referenced below.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Avoid ignoring `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return:** The return value indicates success or failure; your `main()` must return it.
- **Ensure test fixture constructors are default constructible:** `TEST_F` requires a default constructor.
- **Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for operations that may fail:** Fatal assertions are not allowed in constructors/destructors.
- **Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to improve failure diagnostics in complex flows.**
- **Keep tests independent:** Avoid shared mutable states without proper synchronization or reset.
- **Name test suites and tests carefully:** Avoid underscores and reserved prefixes like `DISABLED_` unless intentionally disabling.

# Practical Tips

- Use **`TEST`** for simple, stateless tests.
- Use **`TEST_F`** when tests need shared setup.
- Use **`TEST_P`** and **`INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`** to cover parameter variations systematically.
- Always implement **`SetUpTestSuite`** and **`TearDownTestSuite`** for costly shared resources.
- Avoid complex logic in constructors; prefer `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip tests based on runtime conditions safely.
- Always check that fixture classes provide a default constructor for `TEST_F`.

# Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to call base class `SetUp()` or `TearDown()` when overriding in subclass fixtures.
- Writing fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) in non-void-returning functions.
- Using underscores in test suite or test names.
- Ignoring `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return value.
- Mismanaging shared resources across tests leading to flaky behavior.
