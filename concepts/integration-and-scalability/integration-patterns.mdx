# Integration Patterns

Integrating GoogleTest and GoogleMock effectively into your development workflows is key to maximizing testing productivity and maintaining high code quality. This guide explores common integration patterns that fit naturally into modern developer practices, such as CI/CD pipelines, cross-platform builds, and compositional test architectures. It also details the entry points for test runners and how to hook into build automation tools.

---

## Why Integration Patterns Matter

Testing frameworks like GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide powerful primitives to write and verify unit tests and mocks. However, these capabilities deliver full value only when tightly embedded into the workflow developers use daily. Whether you want to automate tests to run on every push, build on different platforms, or compose test suites for modular validation, understanding integration patterns is essential.

This guide focuses on the practical "what" and "how" — helping you reason about test integration tactics that address real-world challenges.

## Entry Points for Test Execution

To automate and orchestrate tests, you need consistent, well-defined entry points:

### 1. Test Binaries

GoogleTest organizes tests into binaries (executable test suites). Each binary runs all tests it contains, handling setup, execution, and teardown. Key points:

- Each test binary should link against `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` to include the standard `main()` entry point.
- If you provide your own `main()`, initialize GoogleMock with `::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);` before running tests.

### 2. Initialization and Command-Line Arguments

- The `InitGoogleMock` function parses GoogleMock and GoogleTest-specific flags, removes them from the argument list, and prepares the framework for running tests.
- You can pass additional flags to control test running scope, such as filtering tests with `--gtest_filter` or controlling verbosity with `--gmock_verbose`.

### 3. Test Filters and Sharding

- Use `--gtest_filter` to select specific tests or test suites to run.
- For parallelizing tests, GoogleTest supports sharding with flags like `--gtest_shard_index` and `--gtest_total_shards`.

---

## Integration into Build Systems

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are build system agnostic but provide recipes to integrate seamlessly with popular build systems like **CMake** and **Bazel**.

### CMake Integration Patterns

- Add GoogleTest/GoogleMock as external projects or submodules.
- Use `add_subdirectory()` for source inclusion.
- Link test targets against `gtest`, `gtest_main`, `gmock`, and `gmock_main` libraries in your CMakeLists.txt.
- Group tests logically and use `enable_testing()` plus `add_test()` to register test executables.

### Bazel Integration Patterns

- Include GoogleTest/GoogleMock in your `WORKSPACE` via prebuilt packages or external repositories.
- Define `cc_test` targets for your tests, depending on `@com_google_googletest//:gmock` and similar targets.
- You can leverage Bazel’s native test caching and parallel execution.

### Build Tool Hooks and Automation

- Hook test execution into build pipelines (e.g., continuous integration servers) to run tests automatically on commits or merges.
- Use scripts or build tool features to invoke test binaries with appropriate flags.

---

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Workflows

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to integrate smoothly into CI/CD deployments — here are common patterns:

### Automated Test Runs

- Trigger test execution as part of your build job after every push or pull request.
- Capture test logs, timing, and failure reports for visibility.

### Cross-Platform Builds and Testing

- Maintain test definitions portable enough to build and run across different operating systems and architectures.
- Use build system abstractions and GoogleTest’s platform support to enable this.

### Test Result Reporting

- Leverage standard output results; GoogleTest can output XML reports using `--gtest_output=xml:<file>`.
- Feed reports into CI tools to get pass/fail signals and diagnostics.

---

## Compositional Test Architectures

For large projects, organizing tests in scalable, compositional structures improves maintainability.

- Define multiple test binaries grouping related tests by module or feature.
- Use dependent fixtures and inheritance to share setup.
- Mock dependencies precisely with GoogleMock.
- Employ sequences and ordered expectations selectively to verify call order.

---

## Best Practices for Integration

- **Initialize once**: Invoke `InitGoogleMock()` early in test runner `main()` to prepare the framework consistently.
- **Use default main()**: Prefer linking against `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` unless custom test running logic is required.
- **Leverage `EXPECT_CALL` carefully**: Place expectations before exercising mocks to enable early detection.
- **Suppress uninteresting call warnings when appropriate**: Use `NiceMock` or explicit catch-all expectations to reduce noise.
- **Use build system integration examples**: Refer to `guides/advanced-usage-and-integration/integrating-into-builds` for hands-on setups.
- **Automate across platforms**: Test on all supported platforms to catch environment-specific issues early.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Integration Issues

- *Initialization errors*: Forgetting to call `InitGoogleMock` causes flags to be ignored or tests not discovered.
- *Linker errors*: Missing `gmock_main` or `gtest_main` linkage results in unresolved symbols for `main`.
- *Test filtering not working*: Incorrect or missing `--gtest_filter` usage may cause unexpected test selections.
- *Uninteresting/mock warnings*: Use `NiceMock` or manage expectations to quiet warnings correctly.
- *Multi-threaded test flakiness*: Follow thread safety guidelines when using mocks concurrently.

## Summary

Integration patterns for GoogleTest and GoogleMock revolve around establishing robust entry points for test execution, embedding your tests into your build and CI/CD pipelines, and organizing your tests for scalable maintainability. Whether you are just automating a simple build or orchestrating complex cross-platform workflows, GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide the hooks and flexibility to make thorough testing practical and reliable.

## Quick Example: Simple CMake Integration

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

# Add GoogleTest/GoogleMock as subdirectory
add_subdirectory(/path/to/googletest EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# Define your test executable
add_executable(my_tests my_tests.cc)

# Link against gtest and gmock (including main)
target_link_libraries(my_tests PRIVATE gtest_main gmock_main)

# Register the test
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME MyTests COMMAND my_tests)
```

Running:

```bash
ctest
```

Executes all tests defined in `my_tests`.

---

## Quick Example: Initializing GoogleMock in Custom Main

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This ensures that GoogleMock and GoogleTest flags are parsed and tests run.
