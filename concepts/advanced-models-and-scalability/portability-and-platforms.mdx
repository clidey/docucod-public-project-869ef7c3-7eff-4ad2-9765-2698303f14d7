# Portability, Platform Support, and Integration Patterns

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to provide reliable and consistent automated testing capabilities across an extensive range of compilers, operating systems, and hardware platforms. This page explores the strategies and design patterns that ensure portability, platform compatibility, and seamless integration with build and continuous integration systems. Understanding these concepts empowers you to leverage GoogleTest’s full power regardless of your development environment.

## Ensuring Portability Across Compilers and Platforms

GoogleTest maintains portability through careful abstraction and comprehensive environment detection. The framework adapts to platform-specific capabilities while exposing consistent APIs to your tests.

### Platform Detection and Environment Macros

GoogleTest uses internal macros that detect the operating system and platform features at compile time. These macros are defined in `gtest-port-arch.h` and include flags such as `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`, and many more for diverse environments including embedded systems (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32).

This detection enables the framework to conditionally compile platform-specific code, providing necessary system calls, synchronization primitives, and file system utilities tailored to each platform.

### Portability Utilities

Low-level abstractions encapsulated in `gtest-port.h` provide consistent implementations for:

- **Filesystem operations:** File opening, reading, directory handling, and file attribute querying.
- **Threading and synchronization:** Use of native mutexes, locks, and thread-local storage according to platform capabilities.
- **Regular expressions:** Conditional use of RE2, POSIX, or built-in regex support depending on availability.
- **Exception and RTTI support:** Detection and adjustment based on compiler features.

### Compile-Time Control Macros

Users and integrators can define `GTEST_HAS_*` macros to explicitly enable or disable features such as pthreads (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`), exceptions (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`), or stream redirection. This flexibility is essential for cross-compiling or targeting environments with restrictive capabilities, such as embedded systems.

### Thread Safety and Multi-threaded Tests

GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms providing POSIX threads or Windows threading APIs. It uses thread-safe mechanisms for test registration and execution, ensuring stable behavior under parallel test execution. You can check the `GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE` macro in your environment to confirm thread support.

## Supported Platforms and Compilers

GoogleTest supports a broad set of platforms including but not limited to:

- Desktop OS: Windows (Desktop, MinGW, Mobile variants), Linux (including Android), Mac OS, FreeBSD, Solaris
- Embedded and Special platforms: ESP8266, ESP32, NRF52, QNX, Native Client, Haiku, Fuchsia, z/OS

Compiler support includes:

- Microsoft Visual C++
- GCC (various versions)
- Clang
- SunPro, IBM VisualAge, Intel LLVM

You must use a compiler supporting at least C++17 as a minimum standard to build GoogleTest.

### Practical Tips

- Use the provided `gtest-port.h` to confirm platform detection.
- When targeting embedded or unusual environments, explicitly set control macros if auto-detection fails.
- Make sure to install necessary pthread libraries if your platform supports multi-threading.

For a full compatibility matrix, consult the [Supported Platforms](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md) reference.

## Integration Patterns with Build Systems and CI

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with popular C++ build systems and continuous integration (CI) pipelines through patterns designed for flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.

### CMake Integration

GoogleTest includes ready-to-use CMake scripts allowing:

- **Standalone Build:** Build GoogleTest as an independent project using CMake, generating platform-native build files.
- **Embedded Build:** Incorporate GoogleTest source into your existing project via `add_subdirectory()`, ensuring compatible compiler and linker settings.
- **Find and Link:** Use `find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED)` to locate installed GoogleTest packages and link test binaries against `GTest::gtest` or `GTest::gtest_main`.

#### Example for Embedded Integration

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/5376968f6948923e2411081fd9372e71a59d8e77.zip
)
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_test test.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_test gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_test COMMAND my_test)
```

This pattern ensures the same compiler options, runtime linkage, and debug/release modes are shared between your tests and application.

### Bazel and Other Build Tools

GoogleTest supports Bazel with dedicated BUILD files enabling:

- Simple workspace definitions
- Easy inclusion in dependency graphs
- Controlled test execution and flag management

Most modern build systems also support GoogleTest via compatible rules or plugins, as GoogleTest offers conventional interfaces and integration points.

### Continuous Integration Systems

Test suites built with GoogleTest can be executed and reported automatically in CI environments:

- GoogleTest’s test runner returns meaningful exit codes indicating success or failure, critical for CI pass/fail detection.
- Supports XML/JUnit test result output format for CI servers like Jenkins, GitLab, or CircleCI.
- Provides extensive command-line flags for test filtering, sharding, retries, and parallel execution to optimize test runs in CI pipelines.

### Best Practices for Integration

- Link against `gtest_main` to avoid writing custom `main()` functions unless necessary.
- Use platform environment variables and CI flags for dynamic configuration.
- Enable parallel test execution and sharding on CI to reduce feedback cycles.
- Regularly synchronize GoogleTest versions via package management or submodules to avoid incompatibilities.

## Typical User Flow for Cross-Platform Testing

1. **Confirm Platform and Compiler Support:** Check that your target environment is listed among supported platforms.
2. **Select Integration Method:** Choose standalone or embedded build integration based on your project’s build system.
3. **Configure Compiler Flags and Macros:** Apply necessary environment-specific macros (e.g., `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`) and ensure C++17 compliance.
4. **Write Your Tests:** Use GoogleTest’s APIs with confidence the tests will be portable.
5. **Build and Run Tests Locally:** Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` or the test binary generated by your build system.
6. **Integrate into CI/CD Pipeline:** Add test execution steps, enabling test sharding and XML reporting.
7. **Troubleshoot Platform Issues:** Refer to the porting macros and platform-specific details if failures occur.

<Tip>
When building on Windows with Visual Studio, consider setting `gtest_force_shared_crt` to `ON` in your CMake configuration to align runtime library linkage and avoid linker errors.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Portability Challenges

- **Missing pthread on Unix-like systems:** Ensure pthread development headers and libraries are installed.
- **Linker errors on Windows with mixed CRT linkage:** Use GoogleTest CMake options to harmonize runtimes.
- **Incompatible compiler warnings:** Confirm that your compiler supports C++17 or higher.
- **Issue with special platforms:** Use custom configuration macros or consult platform-specific integration notes.
