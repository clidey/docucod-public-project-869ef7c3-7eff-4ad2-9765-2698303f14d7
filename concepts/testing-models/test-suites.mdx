# Test Suites and Test Case Organization

GoogleTest organizes individual tests into **test suites**, providing structure and maintainability by logically grouping related tests. Understanding and applying the concepts of test suite structure, naming conventions, and hierarchical relationships are crucial to creating scalable, maintainable, and progressive test coverage.

---

## Why Organize Tests into Suites?

Imagine you’re working on a large codebase with hundreds or thousands of tests. Without structure, finding related tests, maintaining consistency, and efficiently running specific tests would be like searching for a needle in a haystack. Test suites help you:

- Group logically related tests
- Share common setup/teardown through fixtures
- Facilitate targeted execution and filtering
- Improve readability and maintainability

Organizing tests into suites transforms scattered tests into well-structured collections that mirror your code architecture and testing strategy.

---

## Basic Terminology

- **Test Case/Test Suite:** The container for a collection of tests that share some logical context or fixture. GoogleTest prefers the term *test suite*.
- **Test:** An individual test that verifies a particular behavior or property.
- **Test Fixture:** A C++ class that encapsulates shared setup and teardown logic for tests in a suite.

> Note: GoogleTest historically used *test case*, but now prefers *test suite* for clarity and consistency with industry standards.

---

## Defining Test Suites

### Using `TEST`

- Creates a simple test suite with the name given by the first argument.
- Each test has a unique name within the suite.
- Test suites created with `TEST` do not share state or setup code.

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 3), 5);
}

TEST(MathTest, Subtraction) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Subtract(5, 3), 2);
}
```

*In this example, both tests belong to suite `MathTest`, logically grouping arithmetic tests.*

### Using Fixtures with `TEST_F`

- For suites where tests require shared setup/teardown and state, define a **fixture** class derived from `testing::Test`.
- Use `TEST_F` macro with the fixture name to define tests in the suite.

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertTest) {
  ASSERT_TRUE(db.Insert("record"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryTest) {
  ASSERT_TRUE(db.Query("record"));
}
```

*Here, `DatabaseTest` is the test suite with shared setup for all tests.*

---

## Naming Conventions and Best Practices

### Avoid Underscores `_` in Names

GoogleTest test suite and test names **must not contain underscores** (`_`). This stems from how GoogleTest generates internal test class names, where underscores can cause naming collisions or invalid identifiers.

**Best Practice:** Use camel case or Pascal case for test suite and test names.

### Use Clear, Descriptive Names

Choose names that clearly describe what is being tested and under what conditions, e.g., `FactorialHandlesZeroInput` rather than `Test1`.

### Prefix Disabled Tests with `DISABLED_`

To temporarily disable tests, prefix suite or test names with `DISABLED_`. GoogleTest will compile but skip these tests.

### Death Test Suites

Test suites containing **death tests** (tests expecting the process to die) should be named with the suffix `DeathTest` to ensure they run before other tests and avoid threading conflicts.

---

## Hierarchies and Relationships

GoogleTest organizes tests in a flat **suite → tests** hierarchy, but you can simulate deeper structure through naming and fixture inheritance.

### Fixture Inheritance

You can create base fixture classes to share common setup and extend them in derived fixtures for more specialized test suites.

```cpp
class BaseTest : public ::testing::Test { ... };
class DerivedTest : public BaseTest { ... };

TEST_F(DerivedTest, SpecializedTest) { ... }
```

### Sharing Fixtures Across Suites

If multiple suites require the same fixture, use `typedef` or `using` to alias a fixture class for each.

```cpp
typedef CommonFixture FooTest;
typedef CommonFixture BarTest;

TEST_F(FooTest, TestA) { ... }
TEST_F(BarTest, TestB) { ... }
```

*This eases maintenance by sharing setup logic while keeping suites distinct.*

---

## Parameterized Tests and Suites

GoogleTest supports various parameterized test types that extend suite organization:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**
- **Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)**
- **Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_P` + registration)**

You define test logic once and instantiate suites with multiple parameters or types, automatically expanding tests accordingly.

Practical organization of parameterized tests helps cover combinations efficiently in large projects.

For details, see [Value-Parameterized Tests](../advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) and [Typed Tests](../advanced.md#typed-tests).

---

## Practical Tips for Maintaining Test Suites

- Keep test suites focused and limited in scope—too broad suites become hard to maintain.
- Group tests with similar setup to leverage fixtures and reduce duplication.
- Use meaningful names that help identify failure contexts quickly.
- Avoid dependencies between tests; each test should be able to run independently.
- Use parameterized tests to cover multiple input scenarios efficiently.
- Regularly review and refactor suites to avoid suite bloat and test duplicity.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Fixture Compilation Errors

If you get errors like `no matching function for call to FooTest::FooTest()`, check that:

- Your fixture has a **default constructor**.
- You're **not accidentally declaring custom constructors without default ones**.

### Test Not Running

- Verify that your test suite and test names don’t include underscores.
- Confirm `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called and its result is used (e.g., `return RUN_ALL_TESTS();`).

### Disabled Tests Seem to Run

Tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` are skipped by default. To run disabled tests, use the command line flag `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

### Death Test Conflicts

Death tests run in a separate process; ensure suites with death tests have the suffix `DeathTest` for proper ordering.

---

## Summary

Test suite organization is fundamental to creating reliable, maintainable, and scalable GoogleTest-based test programs. Group related tests by shared purpose and setup using test suites and fixtures, employ consistent naming free of underscores, and leverage parameterized and typed tests for broad coverage with minimal code duplication.

By structuring your tests thoughtfully from the start, you ensure clarity, ease of debugging, and longevity for your test infrastructure.

## Example: From Test to Suite

```cpp
// Simple independent tests in one suite
TEST(StringTest, Empty) {
  EXPECT_TRUE("".empty());
}

TEST(StringTest, NotEmpty) {
  EXPECT_FALSE("abc".empty());
}

// Using fixture for sharing setup
class StringTestFixture : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  std::string str_ = "hello";
};

TEST_F(StringTestFixture, HasLengthFive) {
  EXPECT_EQ(str_.size(), 5);
}

TEST_F(StringTestFixture, StartsWithH) {
  EXPECT_EQ(str_[0], 'h');
}
```

*These suites help separate independent tests from those sharing setup, enabling efficient maintenance and clearer intent.*
