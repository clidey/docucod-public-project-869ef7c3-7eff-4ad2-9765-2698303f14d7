# Customization and Extension Points

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide powerful extension mechanisms that allow you to tailor the testing framework to your project's specific needs. This page guides you through the primary ways to extend and customize GoogleTest and GoogleMock, enabling you to define your own assertions, matchers, and test event listeners. Leveraging these customization points enhances test expressiveness and integration without compromising reliability or composability.

---

## Custom Assertions

Custom assertions let you encapsulate repeated validation logic and improve test readability by creating meaningful, domain-specific checks. GoogleTest supports writing new assertion macros and functions that integrate seamlessly with the test result reporting infrastructure.

### Writing Custom Assertion Macros

A custom assertion macro behaves like the built-in `EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*` macros and can report successes or failures with detailed messages. Use the helper macros like `GTEST_ASSERT_`, `GTEST_EXPECT_`, or define predicates returning `::testing::AssertionResult` to implement your custom logic.

#### Example: Custom IsEven Assertion

```cpp
::testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    return ::testing::AssertionSuccess();
  } else {
    return ::testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is not even.";
  }
}

#define EXPECT_IS_EVEN(val) EXPECT_PRED_FORMAT1(IsEven, val)
```

Usage:

```cpp
EXPECT_IS_EVEN(4);  // Passes
EXPECT_IS_EVEN(3);  // Fails with message "3 is not even."
```

**Tip:** For more complex assertions, return detailed messages to help diagnose failures.

### Writing Assertion Functions

Using `::testing::AssertionResult` is the recommended way for custom assertions. It supports both success and failure messages, and integrates well with existing googletest macros.

## Custom Matchers

GoogleMock provides a rich set of built-in argument matchers, but often your tests need domain-specific criteria. Custom matchers allow you to encapsulate argument validation logic cleanly and produce informative error messages.

### Approaches to Define Custom Matchers

1. **MATCHER and MATCHER_P macros:** Quick and straightforward to define parameterless or parameterized matchers.

    ```cpp
    MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "checks if a number is divisible by 7") {
      return (arg % 7) == 0;
    }

    MATCHER_P(HasAbsoluteValue, value, "checks absolute value equals specified") {
      return abs(arg) == value;
    }
    ```

2. **Custom Matcher Classes:** For advanced cases, create a class with `MatchAndExplain`, `DescribeTo`, and `DescribeNegationTo` methods for full control.

### Using Custom Matchers

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mockObj, Method(IsDivisibleBy7()));
EXPECT_CALL(mockObj, Method(HasAbsoluteValue(10)));
```

### Best Practices

- Ensure matchers are *pure*: no side effects and consistent results for the same input.
- Include detailed failure explanations inside `MatchAndExplain` to improve debugging.

## Custom Actions

Sometimes default mock behaviors are not enough — for example, when you need side effects, complex responses, or stateful logic. GoogleMock lets you define custom actions that can be invoked when a mock method is called.

### Defining Custom Actions

- Use lambdas or functors compatible with the mocked signature.
- Implement the `ActionInterface` or use `MakePolymorphicAction` for polymorphic actions.

#### Example: Custom Increment Action

```cpp
struct IncrementArg1 {
  template <typename Result, typename ArgTuple>
  Result Perform(const ArgTuple& args) const {
    ++(*std::get<0>(args));
    return Result();  // Use appropriate return value
  }
};

Action<ReturnType(Args...)> IncrementArgument() {
  return MakePolymorphicAction(IncrementArg1());
}
```

Then: 

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(_)).WillOnce(IncrementArgument());
```

### Composing Actions

- Use `DoAll()` to combine multiple actions.
- Use `Invoke()` to forward calls to existing functions or methods.

## Mock Strictness and Behavior Customization

GoogleMock provides wrappers to change how uninteresting calls (calls without expectations) are handled:

- `NiceMock<T>`: suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
- `NaggyMock<T>`: prints warnings for uninteresting calls (default behavior).
- `StrictMock<T>`: converts uninteresting calls into errors.

### When to Use Each Style

- Use **`NiceMock`** for tests that should ignore unexpected interactions softly.
- Use **`NaggyMock`** to be informed of unexpected calls but continue the test.
- Use **`StrictMock`** to enforce exact call expectations.

### Example

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;
```

> **Note:** `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` only affect mock methods defined *directly* in the mock class using `MOCK_METHOD`. Methods inherited from base classes may not be affected. The mock class’s destructor should be virtual for full correctness.

## Custom Test Event Listeners

GoogleTest’s Event Listener API empowers you to customize the test execution lifecycle, enabling integrations with custom reporting, logging, or other behaviors.

### How Event Listeners Work

- Event listeners receive callbacks during test program execution:
  - Test program start/end
  - Test suite (test case) start/end
  - Individual test start/end
  - Assertion results

- You can implement your own listener class inheriting from `::testing::EmptyTestEventListener` and override methods you need.

- Register your listener by adding it to the listeners list:

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    // Custom behavior
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    // Custom behavior
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);

  ::testing::TestEventListeners& listeners =
      ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners();

  // Remove default printer if desired
  delete listeners.Release(listeners.default_result_printer());

  listeners.Append(new MyListener);

  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Use Cases

- Custom test result output formats (e.g., integrating with proprietary CI systems)
- Collecting performance or coverage statistics
- Test diagnostics enriched with domain context

## When to Extend GoogleTest and GoogleMock

Customization is powerful but should be purposeful:

- Consider custom assertions and matchers when:
  - Your tests have frequent, complex conditions needing clarity
  - You want reusable validation logic encapsulated

- Use custom actions or mock behaviors when:
  - Tests require controlling side effects or state
  - Test doubles need sophisticated interaction patterns

- Implement custom event listeners when:
  - You must integrate with specific CI output systems
  - You want test lifecycle hooks for additional instrumentation

---

## Summary

Customizing GoogleTest and GoogleMock unlocks the full power of your testing framework, enabling precise, maintainable, and expressive tests tailored to your codebase. Use custom assertions, matchers, and actions to manage validation and mock behaviors with clarity. Employ strictness wrappers to control mock warning and error reporting, and extend test lifecycle interaction via event listeners for enhanced integration and diagnostics.
