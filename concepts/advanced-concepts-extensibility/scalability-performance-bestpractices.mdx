# Scalability, Performance, and Best Practices

As your C++ codebase grows, your test suites naturally expand in size and complexity. GoogleTest and GoogleMock have been designed to scale efficiently and maintain high performance even with large numbers of tests and intricate mock interactions. This guide explores the framework’s scalability considerations, performance characteristics, and recommended best practices to help you keep your test runs fast, reliable, and maintainable.

## Challenges of Scaling Test Suites

Large test suites can present common challenges:

- **Increased compilation times** due to heavy use of template metaprogramming and macros.
- **Longer test execution times** as the number of test cases and mocks grow.
- **Increased memory usage** in the test process, especially with complex mocks and interaction sequences.
- **Risk of brittle tests** that break with minor code or interface changes, increasing maintenance overhead.

GoogleTest and GoogleMock address these challenges with thoughtful design and by encouraging best practices that optimize both developer productivity and test reliability.

## Performance Characteristics

### Compilation Performance

GoogleMock relies on complex macro expansions and template metaprogramming, which can sometimes slow compilation, especially for large mock classes with many mocked methods.

**Best Practices to Improve Compilation Time:**

- **Define mock class constructors and destructors in `.cc` files:**
  Moving constructor and destructor definitions out of headers reduces template instantiation overhead across compilation units.

  ```cpp
  // In mock_foo.h
  class MockFoo : public Foo {
   public:
    MockFoo();
    virtual ~MockFoo();

    MOCK_METHOD(int, DoWork, (), (override));
    // ... more mocked methods
  };

  // In mock_foo.cc
  #include "mock_foo.h"

  MockFoo::MockFoo() {}
  MockFoo::~MockFoo() {}
  ```

- **Minimize number of mocked methods:** Only mock what is necessary for interaction verification.
- **Use typedefs or aliases for complex types with commas in mock declarations** to avoid macro parsing overhead.

### Test Execution Speed

The framework is optimized for fast test execution, but certain patterns may impact runtime:

- **Excessive expectations:** Setting many expectations per test can slow down matching logic.
- **Lengthy sequences or partial ordering:** Complex ordering requirements (`InSequence`, `After`) add overhead.
- **Heavy use of custom actions or matchers:** Complex code inside actions or matchers may impact the test speed.

### Memory Usage

Mocks maintain internal state about expectations, call counts, and sequences. This state grows with the number of mocks and expectations.

Proper test design and cleaning up mocks promptly help maintain low memory footprint.

## Best Practices for Scalability and Performance

### 1. Use Expectation Scoping and Retirement

Expectations are "sticky" by default — they remain active even after reaching their upper bound of calls. This can lead to unexpected errors if calls exceed limits.

To prevent this:

- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` on expectations you want to automatically retire after reaching their call count.
- When using sequences (`InSequence` or `Sequence`), expectations retire automatically as ordering progresses.

This makes tests less brittle and prevents upper-bound violations from cascading unexpectedly.

### 2. Organize Expectations Explicitly

Be deliberate when specifying ordering constraints:

- Use `InSequence` for strict linear ordering requirements.
- Use `After` to specify partial order constraints without linearizing all calls.

Avoid making all expectations strictly ordered unless necessary, as it can dramatically increase complexity and reduce test flexibility.

### 3. Design Focused Tests

- Write tests that verify one behavior/interaction at a time.
- Avoid setting too many expectations in a single test; split complex scenarios into smaller focused tests.

This reduces the overhead per test and makes debugging faster.

### 4. Use Default Actions Wisely

- Use `ON_CALL` in test fixtures or constructors for common default actions.
- Limit `EXPECT_CALL` to only those calls you want to explicitly verify.

Overuse of `EXPECT_CALL` can slow down mocking and increase fragility.

### 5. Prefer NiceMocks to Naggy or StrictMocks Initially

- `NiceMock` suppresses warnings on uninteresting calls, helping reduce noise in tests.
- Avoid overuse of `StrictMock` unless you specifically want to ban unexpected calls.

Picking the right mock strictness helps balance between test robustness and maintainability.

### 6. Leverage Parameterized and Typed Tests for Coverage

Use parameterized (`TEST_P`) and typed tests (`TYPED_TEST`) to increase test case coverage without duplicating mock definitions or test logic.

### 7. Avoid Mocking Large Interfaces When Possible

- Design interfaces focused on specific behavior subsets.
- Prefer fakes or stubs for costly or complex components.

Reducing mock complexity improves both compilation and runtime performance.

### 8. Move Heavy Mock Code to Separately Compiled Units

- Implement mock method definitions outside header files.
- Separate complex mock helpers into dedicated files.

### 9. Use Efficient Matchers and Actions

- Avoid overly complex matchers for frequently called mocks.
- Cache complex matchers if reused multiple times.
- Write simple, fast actions where possible.

### 10. Use Explicit `EXPECT_CALL` Ordering to Manage Side Effects

When mocking methods that cause state mutations or side effects, clearly define call order and behavior to prevent hard-to-debug sequencing bugs.

## Example: Retiring Expectations in a Sequence

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
using ::testing::Return;

{
  InSequence s;

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo())
      .WillOnce(Return(1))
      .RetiresOnSaturation();
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo())
      .WillOnce(Return(2))
      .RetiresOnSaturation();
}
```

This example ensures each expectation is retired after use, allowing repeated calls without violating limits.

---

## Concurrency and Thread Safety

GoogleMock is thread-safe:

- Mock object methods can be called safely from multiple threads.
- Expectation setup (`EXPECT_CALL`, `ON_CALL`) must be done from a single thread before concurrent usage.

For multi-threaded tests:

- Set expectations before spawning threads.
- Avoid changing expectations concurrently.
- Synchronize test code as needed.

The internal locking mechanism prevents data races and maintains correctness without imposing ordering on cross-thread actions.
