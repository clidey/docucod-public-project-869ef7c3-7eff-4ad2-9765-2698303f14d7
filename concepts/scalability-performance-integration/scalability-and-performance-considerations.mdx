# Scalability and Performance Considerations

As your codebase and test suite grow, keeping test execution efficient and manageable is essential. This guide explores core concepts and best practices for optimizing GoogleTest and GoogleMock tests to maintain fast feedback loops and test reliability.

---

## Why Performance Matters

Fast and stable tests empower developers to iterate quickly and maintain high code quality without being bottlenecked by slow or flaky tests. As test suites expand, naively run tests may:

- Consume excessive CPU, I/O, or memory resources
- Take longer to complete, slowing down development and continuous integration
- Cause instability due to flaky or order-dependent tests

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide features and design patterns to address these challenges.

---

## Test Execution Efficiency

### Isolate Tests to Facilitate Parallelism

- Each GoogleTest test is isolated, constructed fresh for each run, enabling tests to run concurrently safely.
- You can utilize test sharding and parallel test runners to spread tests across available CPUs or machines.

### Share Expensive Set-up and Tear-down

- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to prepare shared state once per test suite instead of per test.
- Be mindful to avoid shared mutable state that can introduce test flakiness.

### Selective Test Execution

- Filter tests with flag options such as `--gtest_filter` to run subsets relevant to current work.
- Use test sharding (`--gtest_shard_index` and `--gtest_total_shards`) to distribute test load.

### Employ Efficient Parameterized Testing

- Parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) reduce code duplication but can create large test spaces. Balance coverage against runtime costs.

- Apply selective instantiation or smart parameter sampling to limit test explosion.

---

## Minimizing Test Flakiness

### Avoid Inter-test Dependencies

- Design tests with independent fixtures (isolated environments).
- Do not rely on test execution order or shared global state without synchronization.

### Use `EXPECT_*` Assertions for Non-fatal Failures

- `EXPECT_*` macros allow tests to continue after failure, exposing multiple failures in one go and reducing rerun cycles.

### Robust Mock Setup

- Set clear and realistic expectations on mocks to prevent spurious test failures.
- Use sequences and ordering clauses (`InSequence`, `After`) judiciously to avoid brittle ordering assumptions.

### Control Mock Strictness Levels

- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock` to enforce strict call checking when needed.

### Diagnose Flakiness

- Run tests with `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` to catch order-dependent or flaky tests.

- Use verbose logging levels like `--gmock_verbose=info` to trace mock calls.

---

## Leveraging Parameterized and Type-Parameterized Tests

### Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)

- Write test logic once and supply different inputs.
- Provide broad coverage across input domains.

- **Best Practice:** Limit the number of input parameters to keep runtime manageable.

### Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_P`)

- Test templates over multiple types.
- Useful for generic algorithms or containers.

- Follow careful type coverage strategies to balance test suite size and comprehensiveness.

---

## Advanced Optimization Patterns

### Delegation for Complex Behavior

- Delegate mock calls to real or fake implementations within your mock to reduce duplicated behavior and improve maintainability (see the `DelegateToFake()` pattern in the gMock Cookbook).

### Custom Matchers and Actions

- Define efficient custom matchers to precisely validate arguments, avoiding costly deep comparisons where not necessary.

- Use tailored actions for side-effects and return values instead of expensive default constructions.

### Control Expectation Lifespan

- Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations once saturated, preventing unnecessary overhead on subsequent calls.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

| Pitfall                             | Impact                                 | Solution                                    |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Shared mutable state between tests| Introduces flakiness and data races   | Use fresh fixtures and avoid shared globals |
| Overly broad `EXPECT_CALL`s       | Excessive verification time            | Specify expectations narrowly               |
| Large parameter spaces            | Excessive runtime                      | Sample parameters, limit test cases          |
| Ignoring test failures from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` | False positives                        | Always use return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` |
| Excessive default actions on mocks| Wasted CPU and memory                   | Specify default `ON_CALL` behavior smartly   |

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Profiling and Measuring

- Use test framework flags such as `--gtest_break_on_failure` to investigate failures immediately.
- Measure test execution time; identify tests that consume disproportionate time.

### Improving Slow Tests

- Refactor expensive setup into `SetUpTestSuite()`.
- Replace integration or functional tests with unit tests using mocks where applicable.

- Cache reusable resources smartly.

### Handling Memory Leaks and Stress

- Use heap checkers alongside GoogleTest to detect leaking mocks or fixtures.
- Employ `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations` manually if suspecting test leak issues.

- Run stress tests to identify concurrency issues in mocks (e.g., parallel mock usage in `gmock_stress_test.cc`).

## Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide powerful tools and best practices to keep your test suite scalable, fast, and reliable. Employ isolated, well-designed tests, leverage parameterized tests carefully, and manage expectations and mock behaviors precisely to maintain high performance as your project evolves.
