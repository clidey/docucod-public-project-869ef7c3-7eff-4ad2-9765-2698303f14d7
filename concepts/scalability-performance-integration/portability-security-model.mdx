# Portability and Security Model

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed to operate reliably across a wide range of platforms and environments while ensuring secure and safe test execution. This page explains how portability is achieved in the frameworks through platform abstraction, synchronization primitives, and environment detection. It also highlights security considerations, particularly around sandboxing and safe execution of potentially failing test cases like death tests.

---

## Platform Portability and Abstraction

GoogleTest and GoogleMock aim for consistent behavior on diverse operating systems, compilers, and architectures by leveraging a comprehensive platform and feature abstraction layer. This abstraction ensures that users can write tests with confidence that they will behave uniformly across environments.

### Environment Detection

At the core is a system of preprocessor macros that GoogleTest automatically defines to detect the environment it runs in. These include macros indicating the OS type (e.g., `GTEST_OS_LINUX`, `GTEST_OS_WINDOWS`, `GTEST_OS_MAC`), feature availability (e.g., thread-safety, POSIX regex, exceptions support), and compiler capabilities. This detection allows the framework to conditionally compile platform-specific code while exposing a unified API to the user.

### Platform-Dependent Types and Utilities

GoogleTest provides wrappers and type abstractions for platform differences including:

- **Threading and Synchronization:** Single mutex and thread-local storage implementations adapt internally based on availability of pthreads, Windows native threads, or fallback dummy implementations on single-threaded or non-thread-safe platforms.
- **File and Environment Utilities:** Portable wrappers for filesystem operations, environment variables, and file descriptors handle platform eccentricities seamlessly.
- **Regular Expressions:** The framework switches between using RE2, POSIX regex, or a simple internal regex engine depending on platform capabilities and dependencies.

By isolating these differences, GoogleTest and GoogleMock enable users to write tests without worrying about the underlying platform.

## Security Considerations and Safe Test Execution

Testing frameworks, especially those running *death tests* or unsafe code paths, must protect the host process from crashes or side effects of the tests themselves.

### Death Tests and Sandboxing

Death tests are specialized tests that verify a program crashes or terminates as expected in certain error conditions, often by invoking unsafe code deliberately. To isolate these scenarios:

- GoogleTest uses *sandboxing* strategies to run death tests in subprocesses or alternate threads, depending on platform.
- This prevents the main test runner from crashing or exhibiting undefined behavior.
- The framework detects support for these sandboxing mechanisms automatically via platform macros like `GTEST_HAS_CLONE` on Linux or native process spawning on Windows.
- If the platform does not support death tests safely, the feature is disabled to avoid instability.

### Stream Capture and Redirection

To verify output during tests, GoogleTest includes support for capturing `stdout` and `stderr`. This is implemented with care to avoid interference with other I/O and to work around platform limitations.

### Exception and Signal Safety

GoogleTest detects whether exceptions are enabled (`GTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS`) and configures itself accordingly. Additionally, on platforms supporting structured exception handling (SEH) like Windows, GoogleTest adapts to interact safely with these mechanisms.

<Warning>
Running death tests or tests involving signals and exceptions can be inherently risky. Proper use of GoogleTest’s facilities to handle these cases ensures tests run safely without crashing the test harness.
</Warning>

## Thread Safety and Synchronization

Ensuring thread safety in a cross-platform manner is a pillar of GoogleTest’s portability strategy.

### Threading Detection

GoogleTest automatically detects support for threading primitives such as pthreads (`GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD`), Windows threads, or the lack thereof.

### Synchronization Primitives

- A `Mutex` abstraction wraps platform-specific mutex implementations.
- `MutexLock` facilitates RAII-style locking and unlocking.
- `ThreadLocal` allows per-thread storage of values with consistent API regardless of platform-specific TLS implementations.

On platforms without threading support, GoogleTest provides dummy implementations to maintain compatibility without actual threading.

## Platform-Specific Behavior

The portability model acknowledges platform-specific details that affect test execution:

- **Path Separators:** Defined constants normalize file system path separators (`GTEST_PATH_SEP_`).
- **File System Access:** Wrappers around `stat`, `isatty`, and directory removal (`rmdir`) abstract system calls with iteration on their respective platform-specific semantics.
- **Character Handling:** Utility functions for character classification (`IsAlpha`, `IsSpace`) ensure consistent behavior in test messages and parsing.

---

## Customization and Build Configuration

While GoogleTest auto-detects environments, users can influence the behavior and portability with predefined macros during build configuration:

- Defining macros like `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` can disable thread support explicitly.
- Shared versus static library builds can be controlled with macros such as `GTEST_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY`.
- Compiler and platform peculiarities are accounted for in the build system and can be tweaked to resolve compatibility or security issues.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Confirm Environment Macros:** Verify the detected environment macros if tests exhibit odd platform-specific issues.
- **Use Death Tests Responsibly:** Employ death tests only on supported platforms; use `#ifdef GTEST_HAS_DEATH_TEST` guards when in doubt.
- **Thread Safety:** Write tests assuming thread safety unless explicitly targeting single-threaded environments.
- **Capture Output Safely:** Use the provided stream capture APIs rather than custom redirections for reliable test output verification.

## Glossary

- **Sandboxing:** Running code in a controlled environment to limit its impact on the host process.
- **Death Test:** A test designed to verify code termination under specific failure conditions.
- **Mutex:** A synchronization primitive to protect shared data in multithreaded scenarios.
- **ThreadLocal:** Storage mechanism where each thread holds its own instance of a variable.
