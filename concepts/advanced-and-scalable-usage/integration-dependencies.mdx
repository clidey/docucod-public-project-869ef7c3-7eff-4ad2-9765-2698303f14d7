# Integration & External Dependencies

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are powerful C++ testing frameworks designed to integrate seamlessly into diverse project environments. This guide focuses specifically on common and advanced integration patterns, embedding into build systems, handling third-party dependencies, and configuring runtime behavior for an efficient test execution workflow.

---

## Embedding GoogleTest and GoogleMock in Build Systems

### Standalone Builds

You can build GoogleTest as a standalone project, which is useful for running tests independently or for isolating the test framework from your main codebase.

- **Using CMake:**
  - Clone the repository and create a separate build directory.
  - Run `cmake ..` to generate native build scripts.
  - Optionally disable GoogleMock by setting `-DBUILD_GMOCK=OFF` if you only need GoogleTest.
  - Use `make` (or your platform's equivalent) to build.
  - Install GoogleTest if required (default path `/usr/local/`).

This approach allows you to manage the testing framework independently and use the installed libraries in multiple projects.

### Embedding Into Existing Build Systems

For tighter integration and shared compiler/linker settings:

- **Direct incorporation in your CMake project:**
  - Add GoogleTest as a subdirectory using `add_subdirectory()`.
  - This ensures compiler flags, dependencies, and standard versions stay consistent.
  - Example:

  ```cmake
  include(FetchContent)
  FetchContent_Declare(
    googletest
    URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.16.0.zip
  )
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

  add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(my_tests PRIVATE gtest gtest_main)
  ```

- **Using `find_package` after installing GoogleTest:**
  - Use `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` to locate the library.
  - Link with `GTest::gtest` and `GTest::gtest_main` in your targets.

Both methods ensure your tests are linked and compiled correctly alongside your application.

## Relationship between GoogleTest and GoogleMock

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest by providing facilities to create mock objects and specify expectations on mock methods.

- GoogleMock depends on GoogleTest; it can be built with or without GoogleTest's main entry point.
- The libraries `gmock` and `gmock_main` provide the mock framework and a main function for test executables respectively.
- To use mocks in your tests:
  - Link against `gmock` and `gtest`.
  - If you want an automatic main function, link against `gmock_main`.

This modular design enables you to include only the components needed for your specific testing scenario.

---

## Handling Third-Party Dependencies

While GoogleTest aims to be lightweight and easy to integrate, certain environments may require third-party dependencies.

### Abseil and RE2

- When the `GTEST_HAS_ABSL` option is enabled during build, GoogleTest integrates with Abseil and RE2 libraries.
- Benefit from enhanced string utilities, regular expressions, and modern C++ features.
- To activate, ensure Abseil and RE2 are available on your system and linked properly.

### Threading Libraries

- GoogleTest uses pthreads on POSIX platforms to provide thread safety.
- If pthread detection fails, GoogleTest can be forced to enable pthread support via `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1`.

### Windows Runtime Libraries

- On Windows, special considerations handle dynamic vs static runtime linkage to avoid conflicts.
- Use the `gtest_force_shared_crt` CMake option to align GoogleTest's runtime linkage with your project.

---

## Integration Tips and Best Practices

### Consistent Compiler Settings

Ensure your test binaries share compiler flags and language standards with your main application, preventing subtle runtime errors and incompatibilities.

### Linking and Dependencies

- Link your test executable against GoogleTest and, if needed, GoogleMock.
- Adding `gtest_main` or `gmock_main` simplifies test program entry points.

### Managing Test Fixtures and Shared Resources

Use `SetUpTestSuite` and `TearDownTestSuite` (or similar mechanisms) to share expensive resources across multiple tests.

### Handling Multiple Test Executables

Separate test executables can be created for different components or layers of your application, facilitating focused and faster test runs.

### Environment Setup and Global Tear-Down

Use `testing::Environment` subclasses for global setup and teardown routines that affect all tests, such as establishing database connections or seeding random generators.

---

## Advanced Configuration and Runtime Controls

### Command-Line Flags and Environment Variables

GoogleTest supports rich command-line control over test execution.

- `--gtest_filter` to select which tests to run based on name patterns.
- `--gtest_repeat` to execute tests multiple times to detect flaky behavior.
- `--gtest_shuffle` and `--gtest_random_seed` to randomize test order, exposing inter-test dependencies.
- `--gtest_output` can generate detailed XML or JSON reports consumable by CI systems.

These options enable flexible, powerful test execution strategies.

### Programmatic Registration

For highly dynamic test scenarios, you can register tests at runtime using `testing::RegisterTest`. This allows conditional creation or parameterization of tests beyond what macros provide.

### Custom Event Listeners

GoogleTestâ€™s event listener API can be used to create custom logging, reporting, or integration hooks into your test lifecycle.

### Handling Test Skips

Use `GTEST_SKIP()` within tests or `SetUp()` methods to programmatically skip tests when certain conditions are not met, such as missing dependencies or unsupported platforms.

---

## Troubleshooting Integration

- Ensure test fixture classes have default constructors for the macros like `TEST_F()` to work.
- Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same test suite.
- On Windows, be aware of the runtime linkage configuration, especially with Visual Studio project defaults.
- If using death tests, make sure only one test fixture suite includes them or split tests into `*DeathTest` suites to maintain correct execution order.

## Practical Examples

### Using GoogleTest with CMake

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyProject LANGUAGES CXX)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  googletest
  URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.16.0.zip
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

add_executable(my_tests test_main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_tests PRIVATE gtest gtest_main)
add_test(NAME my_tests COMMAND my_tests)
```

Run with:

```shell
ctest -V
```

### Adding Global Test Environment

```cpp
class MyGlobalEnvironment : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // perform expensive setup
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // clean resources
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyGlobalEnvironment);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This setup ensures that environment setup runs once per test program execution.
