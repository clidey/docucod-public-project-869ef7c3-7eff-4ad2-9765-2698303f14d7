# Test Fixtures and Parameterized Tests

Discover how test fixtures facilitate structured, repeatable test contexts and how parameterized tests scale coverage with varied inputs and types. These mechanisms drive comprehensive and maintainable test suites.

---

## Introduction

In the pursuit of reliable and maintainable C++ tests, GoogleTest offers powerful abstractions—test fixtures and parameterized tests—that enable structured testing with reusable contexts and broad input coverage. This guide unfolds how these concepts work in practice, empowering you to write robust tests that are both expressive and scalable.

Whether you are organizing common object states shared by multiple tests or scaling tests to cover diverse inputs without code duplication, mastering these tools ensures your test suites remain thorough yet manageable.

## Understanding Test Fixtures: Reusing Test Context

Test fixtures are the cornerstone for grouping tests that share a common environment. They let you centralize setup and teardown logic, so each test runs in a fresh, controlled context.

### What Is a Test Fixture?

A test fixture is essentially a C++ class derived from `testing::Test` that encapsulates the shared objects, variables, and setup/cleanup logic needed for a set of tests.

### Why Use Test Fixtures?

- **Eliminates duplication**: You avoid repeating setup and teardown code in each test.
- **Ensures isolation**: Each test gets a pristine fixture instance, preventing side effects.
- **Improves readability**: Tests focus on behavior, not setup.

### Creating a Test Fixture

1. Define a class inheriting from `testing::Test`.
2. Place common data members and initialization in the constructor or the `SetUp()` method.
3. Place cleanup in the destructor or `TearDown()`.
4. Use `TEST_F` macro to write individual tests using the fixture.

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    db.Connect();
    db.Clear();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    db.Disconnect();
  }

  Database db;
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, InsertRecord) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Insert("record1"));
}

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, DeleteRecord) {
  db.Insert("record2");
  EXPECT_TRUE(db.Delete("record2"));
}
```

### Best Practices

- Prefer `SetUp()`/`TearDown()` over constructor/destructor for clarity and integration with GoogleTest lifecycle.
- Keep fixtures focused and lightweight—share only what’s needed.
- Avoid dependencies between tests; fixture’s fresh instance ensures tests don't affect each other.

## Parameterized Tests: Scaling Coverage with Varied Inputs

Parameterized tests expand test coverage by running the same logic against multiple input values or types, minimizing code repetition while maximizing thoroughness.

### Value-Parameterized Tests

Use when testing the same logic with multiple values.

### Defining a Value-Parameterized Test

1. Derive your test fixture from `testing::TestWithParam<Type>`, where `Type` is the parameter type.
2. Use `TEST_P` macro instead of `TEST_F` for test functions.
3. Access the parameter using `GetParam()` inside the test.
4. Instantiate test instances with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` and specify parameter generators.

```cpp
class FactorialTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesVariousInputs) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GE(Factorial(n), 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    PositiveNumbers,
    FactorialTest,
    testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 8));
```

### Parameter Generators

GoogleTest offers versatile parameter generators:

- `Values()`: Enumerate explicit values.
- `Range(begin, end, step)`: Generate a sequence.
- `Bool()`: Generates `false` and `true`.
- `ValuesIn(container)`: Generate from container or iterator range.
- `Combine(...)`: Cartesian product of multiple generators for multi-parameter tests.

### Typed Tests

When you want to run tests for multiple types sharing the same API:

1. Create a class template derived from `testing::Test`.
2. Define `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` with the list of types.
3. Write tests using the `TYPED_TEST` macro.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class StackTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  Stack<T> stack;
};

using MyTypes = testing::Types<int, float, double>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(StackTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(StackTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(this->stack.IsEmpty());
}
```

### Customizing Test Names

When instantiating parameterized tests, you can provide a custom name generator to produce readable test names:

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    MyInts, MyTest,
    testing::Values(1, 2, 3),
    [](const testing::TestParamInfo<int>& info) {
      return "Val" + std::to_string(info.param);
    });
```

### Advantages of Parameterized Tests

- **Compact**: Write the test logic once, test many cases.
- **Comprehensive**: Cover boundary and corner cases easily.
- **Maintainable**: Changes in test logic propagate to all cases.

### Common Pitfalls

- Ensure `GetParam()`’s type matches the instantiated parameter generator.
- Avoid complex setup in parameter constructors to keep tests clear.
- Use custom name generators for clarity in test reports.

## Workflow Example: Combining Fixtures and Parameterized Tests

Suppose you want to test a `Calculator` class that operates on different numeric types and performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

1. Use typed tests for coverage across types:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class CalculatorTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  Calculator<T> calc;
};

typedef testing::Types<int, float, double> NumericTypes;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(CalculatorTest, NumericTypes);

TYPED_TEST(CalculatorTest, AddsNumbers) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->calc.Add(1, 2), 3);
}
```

2. Use value-parameterized tests for inputs:

```cpp
class CalculatorAddTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<int, int, int>> {
 protected:
  Calculator<int> calc;
};

TEST_P(CalculatorAddTest, CorrectAdd) {
  int a, b, expected;
  std::tie(a, b, expected) = GetParam();
  EXPECT_EQ(calc.Add(a, b), expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    IntegerPairs,
    CalculatorAddTest,
    testing::Values(
      std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3),
      std::make_tuple(10, 20, 30),
      std::make_tuple(-1, -5, -6)
    ));
```

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) when tests share complex setup or objects.
- For simple reuse of data without special context, prefer plain `TEST` with helper functions.
- Prefer value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) over writing many similar test functions for different inputs.
- Combine `testing::Combine()` with `TEST_P` for multi-parameter inputs.
- When dealing with type variations, use typed tests (`TYPED_TEST`).
- Remember to always instantiate parameterized tests with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- Utilize custom name generators for parameterized tests to make test reports more readable.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests not running:** Ensure you called `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`. Without instantiation, parameterized tests won't run.
- **Mismatched parameter type:** Verify your test fixture inherits from `TestWithParam<Type>` matching your parameter generator.
- **Overloaded methods in mocks:** Employ explicit matchers or disambiguation techniques if tests fail unexpectedly in fixtures.
- **Test names too long or unclear:** Provide custom name generators to simplify the test output and improve diagnosability.
- **State leaking between tests:** Avoid static or shared mutable state in fixtures to keep tests isolated.
