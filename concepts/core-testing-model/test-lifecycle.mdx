# Test Lifecycle & Execution Flow

GoogleTest automates the entire workflow of discovering, registering, executing, and reporting tests, empowering you to focus on writing meaningful tests that raise confidence in your code. This page explains how GoogleTest orchestrates the lifecycle of tests—from the moment they are defined in your source code, through runtime execution, to the final result reporting.

---

## 1. Test Discovery and Registration

GoogleTest automatically discovers tests by intercepting `TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, `TYPED_TEST`, and related macros at compile time. This automatic registration eliminates the need for users to manually maintain a registry of their tests.

### How Registration Works

- Each `TEST()` or related macro expands into code that statically registers a test with GoogleTest’s internal framework.
- Registration associates test metadata such as suite (test suite or fixture), test name, source file, and line number with a factory that can create instances of test objects.
- Tests are grouped logically by their test suites, supporting both simple and fixture-based test organization.

#### Example
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```
This expands to define a test and register it automatically so that it runs when `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called.

<Check>
You do not need to list or register tests manually to run them. Defining a test macro is sufficient.
</Check>

---

## 2. Test Suite Initialization

Once tests are registered, GoogleTest manages test suites, which are collections of logically related tests. A test suite corresponds to a group of tests sharing a common fixture or purpose.

### Test Suite Setup and Teardown

- GoogleTest supports per-test-suite setup and teardown via static methods:
  - `SetUpTestSuite()` — called **once before** the first test in the suite runs.
  - `TearDownTestSuite()` — called **once after** the last test in the suite completes.

- These methods allow you to prepare expensive shared resources, such as database connections or global state, once per suite.

- Fixture initialization at this stage also ensures tests remain independent of one another while reusing setup when needed.

#### Example
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    shared_resource_ = new Resource();
  }
  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete shared_resource_;
    shared_resource_ = nullptr;
  }
  static Resource* shared_resource_;
};
Resource* QueueTest::shared_resource_ = nullptr;
```

## 3. Test Fixture Instantiation and Execution

GoogleTest creates a *fresh* test fixture instance for each test to ensure complete isolation.

### Test Execution Flow for Each Test

1. **Construction of the test fixture object:** The test fixture class's constructor is invoked.
2. **`SetUp()` method call:** Called immediately after the constructor to prepare test-specific state.
3. **Execution of the test body:** The code inside your `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` runs.
4. **`TearDown()` method call:** Cleans up the test fixture and releases resources.
5. **Destruction of the test fixture object:** The test fixture is destroyed, ensuring no lingering state.

Each test runs independently; no shared state leaks across tests.

<Info>
GoogleTest does **not** reuse test fixture objects across tests—even within the same suite.
</Info>

### Handling Failures

- `ASSERT_*` macros generate **fatal failures** and **abort the current test function** immediately, skipping subsequent statements.
- `EXPECT_*` macros generate **non-fatal failures** and allow the test to continue executing for further checks.

<Warning>
Fatal assertion macros must only be used inside void-returning functions (like test bodies or `SetUp()`/`TearDown()`). Otherwise, compilation errors occur.
</Warning>

---

## 4. Parameterized and Typed Tests Lifecycle

GoogleTest supports advanced test parametrization mechanisms:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`, `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`):** Run the same test logic over multiple values.
- **Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE`, `TYPED_TEST`):** Run the same test logic over multiple types.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`, `TYPED_TEST_P`, etc.):** Like typed tests but allow later instantiation with types.

For these tests:

- Test suite and test instances are generated dynamically during GoogleTest initialization.
- Test names include parameter values or type names to uniquely identify each instance.
- All lifecycle phases (setup, test body, teardown) are applied per instantiated test.

<Note>
If you define `SetUpTestSuite()` or `TearDownTestSuite()` for parameterized tests, these must be declared **public**.
</Note>

## 5. Test Runner Execution Flow

When your test program calls `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest undertakes the following:

1. It iterates through all registered test suites.
2. For each test suite, it calls `SetUpTestSuite()` once, if defined.
3. Runs **all tests** in the suite, each with its full lifecycle (construction, setup, test body, teardown, destruction).
4. Calls `TearDownTestSuite()` after all tests in the suite have completed.
5. Collects and tracks the results of each test.
6. Optionally shuffles tests if `--gtest_shuffle` is enabled, supports test filtering, repeat execution, and test sharding.
7. Reports summarized test results to the console, XML or JSON files, or other configured listeners.

---

## 6. Event Listeners and Test Result Reporting

GoogleTest features a flexible event listener mechanism to track and customize test execution reporting:

- The default listeners provide output to the console and write XML/JSON reports.
- Event listeners can be appended or replaced to customize output, integrate with IDEs, or external test runners.
- Events include start/end of tests, suites, test programs and individual assertion results.
- Failures include file, line number, expected/actual values, and detailed messages to aid debugging.

---

## 7. Skipping and Disabling Tests

- Use the `DISABLED_` prefix on test or suite names to temporarily disable tests without removing or commenting out code.
- Disabled tests are compiled but not run by default.
- You can run disabled tests by passing `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.
- Tests can skip execution at runtime using `GTEST_SKIP()` in `SetUp()`, test body, or global environment setup.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

### Naming Restrictions

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent internal name clashes (e.g., `TEST(MySuite, MyTest)`, not `TEST(My_Suite, My_Test)`).

### Assertion Placement

- Do not use fatal assertions (`ASSERT_*`) inside constructors or destructors. Instead, put setup logic in `SetUp()` and teardown logic in `TearDown()`.

### Test Independence

- Each test operates on a new instance of the test fixture.
- Tests should not rely on side effects from other tests.

### Handling Failures in Helper Functions

- Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or check `HasFatalFailure()` after helper calls to propagate fatal failures correctly.

## 9. Practical Tips for Test Lifecycle Success

- **Always call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`** to ensure proper initialization.
- **Use `TEST_F` for tests that require a fixture**, allowing setup and teardown.
- **Keep test fixtures lightweight for fast execution**, but use `SetUpTestSuite()` for costly shared state.
- **Avoid sharing state between tests that can cause flaky or interdependent errors.**
- **Consider using parameterized and typed tests to reduce test duplication.**
- **Use event listeners to extend or customize test reporting according to your needs.**

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Symptom                                      | Possible Cause                             | Solution                                         |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------| 
| Tests not running                            | `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` not called or flags incorrect | Ensure `InitGoogleTest()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` are called, verify filters |
| Tests reporting no failures despite failures | Return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` ignored | Use `return RUN_ALL_TESTS();` in `main()`        |
| Intermittent test failures                   | Shared state improper or test dependencies | Ensure test independence, use per-test fixtures  |
| Fatal assertion in constructor causes crashes | Fatal assertions used in constructors    | Move setup to `SetUp()`, avoid fatal macros in constructors |
