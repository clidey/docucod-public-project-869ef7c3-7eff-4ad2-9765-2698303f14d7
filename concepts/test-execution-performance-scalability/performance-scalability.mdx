# Performance and Scalability

GoogleTest is designed to remain performant and scalable as your test suites grow in size and complexity. This page provides you with a clear understanding of the strategies GoogleTest employs to help you run tests efficiently, including test filtering, sharding for parallel execution, and awareness of the performance implications of parameterized and typed tests.

## Understanding Test Filtering

### What is Test Filtering?

Test filtering allows you to run a subset of tests from a large suite, so you can focus on specific functionality or debug a particular issue quickly.

### How It Works

By specifying the `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable, you tell GoogleTest to run only tests whose full names match the filter pattern. The filter supports simple wildcards (`*` and `?`) and exclusion patterns to narrow down the tests run:

- `--gtest_filter=FooTest.*` runs all tests in `FooTest` suite.
- `--gtest_filter=*Null*` runs tests whose names contain 'Null'.
- `--gtest_filter=FooTest.*-FooTest.Bar` runs all tests in `FooTest` except `Bar`.

This selective execution reduces test run time by avoiding irrelevant tests.

### Practical Tips

- Use test filtering during development to speed up feedback cycles.
- Combine filtering with `--gtest_repeat` to repeatedly run selected tests until a flaky issue appears.

## Harnessing Test Sharding

### What is Sharding?

Sharding divides your test suite into multiple partitions (shards), each running on a separate machine or process, enabling parallel execution to reduce overall test completion time.

### How GoogleTest Supports Sharding

GoogleTest recognizes sharding parameters through two environment variables:

- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: Total number of shards.
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: Zero-based index of the current shard.

When these are set, GoogleTest automatically distributes the individual test functions evenly across shards, ensuring that across all shards each test runs exactly once.

### Typical Workflow

1. Allocate multiple machines or processes.
2. Set `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` to the total number.
3. Set `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` differently on each.
4. Run the same test binary on all machines/processes.
5. Aggregate results after all shards complete.

### Benefits and Pitfalls

Sharding can dramatically speed up large test programs but requires your test environment to support parallel execution. Also, shared resources should be shard-aware to avoid conflicts.

---

## Parallel Execution and Test Runners

### Beyond Sharding

Besides external sharding, some test runners and CI platforms can execute tests in parallel within a single machine, leveraging multiple cores.

GoogleTest outputs test names in a manner compatible with many parallel runners and supports XML output for integration with CI dashboards.

### Minimizing Overhead in Large Test Suites

GoogleTest creates a fresh test fixture for every test invocation to guarantee isolation. When you have very large test suites or heavily parameterized tests, this might introduce noticeable overhead.

### Strategies to Improve Performance

- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` static methods within test fixtures to share expensive resources across tests in the suite.
- Prefer using `ON_CALL` over many `EXPECT_CALL`s for mock behaviors if calls aren’t strictly verified, reducing internal bookkeeping.
- Avoid overusing `EXPECT_CALL` for calls that are not critical to the test’s correctness.

---

## Impact of Parameterized and Typed Tests on Performance

### Parameterized Tests

Value-parameterized (`TEST_P`) and type-parameterized (`TYPED_TEST`) tests enable exercising test logic over many inputs or types efficiently:

- They generate multiple instances of tests at runtime.
- While this adds flexibility and code reuse, it also increases the number of actual test runs.

### Performance Considerations

- Large parameter sets may lead to combinatorial explosion in test counts, significantly increasing execution time.
- The test runner scales with the total number of test instances.
- Using selective filtering or sharding helps manage this scale.

### Best Practices

- Limit the number of parameters to essential representatives.
- Use parameter generators thoughtfully.
- Customize test names for clarity to aid filtering.

## Measuring and Monitoring Test Suite Performance

GoogleTest provides built-in timing information:

- Test durations are reported individually.
- XML and JSON reports include timing data usable in CI to identify slow tests.

Use these insights to identify bottlenecks and refactor or shard accordingly.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

<Tip>
- If your test suite runs too long, first isolate slow tests using `--gtest_print_time` flag.
- Use filtering and repeated runs to find flaky or slow-running test cases.
- Consider splitting large test binaries into smaller ones to exploit parallelism.
- Leverage sharding environment variables to distribute load.
- Cache or share expensive resources via test-suite fixtures.
</Tip>

---

## Summary

Performance and scalability in GoogleTest hinge on:

- Efficient use of test filtering to run subsets.
- Running tests in parallel shards on multiple hosts.
- Proper use of parameterized and typed tests without overloading the runner.
- Sharing expensive resources across tests within suites.
- Monitoring and measuring test run times to detect bottlenecks early.

Integrating these practices ensures a fast, reliable, and maintainable C++ test framework as your project scales.

### Example: Running Tests in Parallel with Sharding

To run tests split across 4 shards (machines or processes), set environment variables:

```bash
export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=0  # for shard 0
./my_tests_binary

export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=1  # for shard 1
./my_tests_binary

export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=2  # for shard 2
./my_tests_binary

export GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS=4
export GTEST_SHARD_INDEX=3  # for shard 3
./my_tests_binary
```

Each shard executes a distinct subset of tests, optimizing resource utilization and total runtime.

### Command-Line Example: Filtering Tests

To run only tests that contain `Math` in the suite or test name:

```bash
./my_tests_binary --gtest_filter=*Math*
```

To exclude flaky tests:

```bash
./my_tests_binary --gtest_filter=-*FlakyTest*
```
