# Scalability and Performance

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are designed not only to help you write high-quality tests but also to scale seamlessly to large codebases with thousands of tests. This guide explains how these frameworks support scalability and performance, ensuring your testing process remains efficient, fast, and reliable as your project grows.

---

## Overview

As your codebase expands, so does your test suite. Running a vast number of tests sequentially can become a bottleneck, delaying feedback cycles and impacting developer productivity. GoogleTest and GoogleMock offer several built-in capabilities and recommended best practices to manage this scale effectively.

You will learn:
- How to organize and run thousands of tests efficiently.
- Strategies for parallel execution.
- Approaches to tune tests for speed and reliability.


## Organizing Large Test Suites

Proper structure is key for managing large numbers of tests. GoogleTest encourages grouping logically related tests into **test suites** (formerly called test cases). This organizational method allows:

- Isolation of related tests to share fixtures and resources.
- Easier filtering and selective execution.
- Simplified maintenance and readability.

### Best Practices for Large Suites

- Avoid overly large test fixtures to prevent complex setup/teardown slowing tests.
- Use **TEST_F** and parameterized tests (**TEST_P**) to reduce redundant code when testing multiple scenarios.
- Implement **value-parameterized** and **typed tests** to cover input ranges or type variants in a scalable way.


## Parallel and Distributed Test Execution

When your test suite grows into thousands of tests, running them sequentially becomes impractical. GoogleTest supports various methods to accelerate test runs through parallelism and distribution.

### Sharding Tests

GoogleTest supports *test sharding*, where the test workload is divided across multiple machines or processes (shards). Each shard runs a distinct subset of tests, enabling parallel execution and faster aggregate results.

**How to use sharding:**

1. Set environment variables on each shard
   - `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` to the total number of shards
   - `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` to the shard’s zero-based index (from 0 to one less than total shards)
2. Run the same test binary on each shard

GoogleTest automatically selects which tests to run on each shard, ensuring tests are split evenly and without overlap.

### Concurrent Test Threads

On platforms where GoogleTest is thread-safe (Linux, macOS, Windows with pthreads support), tests can be executed concurrently within the same process. Though GoogleTest itself does not automatically parallelize test execution, many build and test runners integrate thread-level parallelism.

**Note:** Developers must ensure fixtures and mocks are thread-safe when sharing across concurrent tests.

### Considerations and Tips

- Use the `--gtest_repeat` flag to run tests multiple times, for stress testing or catching flaky tests.
- Combine sharding with repeat and shuffle (`--gtest_shuffle` flag) to expose test order dependencies and intermittent failures.
- Avoid shared mutable state where possible to prevent race conditions during parallel runs.


## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Reusing Shared Resources

GoogleTest allows you to share expensive-to-create test resources and data across tests using **per-test-suite setUp/tearDown** (`SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`). This approach:

- Avoids repeated initialization costs.
- Reduces overall test execution time.

Ensure:
- Shared resources are immutable or properly reset between tests.
- Test order independence is maintained to avoid flaky results.

### Skipping Tests Intelligently

Use `GTEST_SKIP()` within tests or fixtures to bypass tests that are not relevant in certain configurations or environments. This can drastically reduce runtime, especially in large test matrices.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(FailingTest, Skippable) {
  if (!IsFeatureSupported()) {
    GTEST_SKIP() << "Skipping because feature not supported";
  }
  ... // test logic
}
```

### Avoiding Fatal Failures in Constructors

Because fatal assertions abort only the current function, placing fatal assertions in test fixture constructors can leave tests in inconsistent states, which hurts reliability and debugging.

**Recommendation:** Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` overrides instead of constructors/destructors for test initialization and cleanup.


## Reliability Under Load

Extensive testing must remain reliable under high test volumes and concurrency.

### Traces and Debugging Support

GoogleTest’s **SCOPED_TRACE** macro adds scoped contextual messages to failure reports, which is invaluable for understanding failures in complex or repeat-heavy tests.

### Assertion Placement and Propagation

Understanding how assertions propagate is important when tests and helpers interact. Use `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE()` or check `HasFatalFailure()` to guard continuation based on prior failures.

### Handling Flaky Tests

To identify and debug flaky tests that fail intermittently:

- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to rerun tests multiple times.
- Combine with sharding and random seed settings to test under varying conditions.


## Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock empower developers at scale to:

- Organize and manage large, complex test suites.
- Run tests efficiently using sharding and concurrency.
- Tune test performance through shared resource management and skipping.
- Maintain reliable and insightful test results, even under heavy loads.

By adopting these practices, your team will sustain rapid feedback loops and high confidence in code quality as your project grows.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common performance and scalability pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Tests running slower than expected in parallel">
Often caused by shared resources without proper synchronization. Ensure your shared fixtures or mocks are thread-safe, and avoid global mutable state.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Flaky tests only observed with sharding or repeats">
Check for hidden test dependencies on order or side effects. Use `--gtest_shuffle` and `--gtest_repeat` to isolate flaky tests, and leverage `SCOPED_TRACE` for better failure context.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Too much resource consumption due to large test suites">
Consider using `GTEST_SKIP()` to disable irrelevant tests in certain scenarios, and share setup costs via `SetUpTestSuite()` / `TearDownTestSuite()` to reduce overhead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests failing due to assertion placement in constructors">
Do not place fatal assertions inside test fixture constructors as they don't abort the entire test. Use `SetUp` methods instead.
