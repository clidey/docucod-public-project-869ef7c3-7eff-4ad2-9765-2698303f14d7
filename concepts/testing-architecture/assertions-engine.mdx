# Assertion Framework and Failure Handling

GoogleTest equips you with a rich and robust assertion framework designed to validate test conditions effectively while providing precise control over test flow and failure management. This guide introduces you to the wide variety of built-in and user-defined assertions, clarifies the distinction between fatal and non-fatal failures, and explains how GoogleTest internally reports, aggregates, and acts on these test results.

## Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

Assertions are the pillars of verification in your tests. An assertion checks whether a condition holds true during test execution. Each assertion outcome shapes the test flow and overall test verdict.

### Fatal vs. Non-Fatal Assertions

GoogleTest provides two flavors of assertions, distinguished by the severity of their failures:

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`)**:
  - Cause immediate termination of the current test function upon failure.
  - Best used when further execution of the test makes no sense or may cause undefined behavior.
  - Examples: `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)`, `ASSERT_EQ(val1, val2)`.

- **Non-Fatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`)**:
  - Report failures but allow the current test function to continue running.
  - Ideal when you want to check multiple conditions in a single test and gather all failures.
  - Examples: `EXPECT_TRUE(condition)`, `EXPECT_EQ(val1, val2)`.

**Choosing between `ASSERT_` and `EXPECT_`:** If failure of a check invalidates subsequent checks or the setup, use `ASSERT_`. If your test remains meaningful despite some failures, prefer `EXPECT_` for richer feedback.

### Assertion Macros Overview

GoogleTest offers a broad suite of assertion macros for diverse verification needs:

- **Boolean Conditions:** `EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_FALSE`, `ASSERT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`
- **Equality and Inequality:** `EXPECT_EQ`, `EXPECT_NE`, `ASSERT_EQ`, `ASSERT_NE`
- **Relational Operators:** `EXPECT_LT`, `EXPECT_LE`, `EXPECT_GT`, `EXPECT_GE` and corresponding `ASSERT_*`
- **String Comparisons:** `EXPECT_STREQ`, `EXPECT_STRNE`, `EXPECT_STRCASEEQ`, and `EXPECT_STRCASENE`
- **Floating-Point Comparisons:** `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, and `EXPECT_NEAR` allow approximate matching for floats and doubles, considering rounding errors
- **Exception Assertions:** `EXPECT_THROW`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW`, `EXPECT_NO_THROW`, and their `ASSERT_` counterparts for exception handling verification
- **Predicate Assertions:** Advanced checking via predicates such as `EXPECT_PRED1`...`EXPECT_PRED5` for custom validation
- **Death Assertions:** Including `EXPECT_DEATH`, `EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH`, for verifying that certain code triggers program termination

### Custom Failure Messages

All assertion macros support streaming a custom failure message to augment the default diagnostics, enhancing test clarity. For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Expected condition to be valid but found false";
```

Use this feature liberally to provide context that will help you quickly understand test failures.

## Reporting, Aggregating, and Acting on Test Results

Behind the scenes, GoogleTest collects assertion outcomes and orchestrates their impact on test execution.

### Result Aggregation

- Each assertion records a test-part result which can be success or failure, fatal or non-fatal.
- For non-fatal failures, the test continues, but failures accumulate and are reported after test execution.
- Fatal failures immediately abort the current test function but preserve overall test execution for other tests.

### Test and Suite Status

- A test case is considered failed if any assertion (fatal or non-fatal) fails within it.
- GoogleTest aggregates results at the test suite and entire program level,
  providing concise summaries of success, failure counts, and failure details.

### Internal Mechanisms for Assertions

GoogleTest's assertion macros:

- Evaluate the condition or expression.
- On failure, assemble detailed diagnostic messages indicating:
  - The expected and actual values
  - File and line number information
  - Optional custom message
- Differentiate reporting between fatal and non-fatal failures affecting control flow

---

## Writing Effective Assertions

To harness the full power of GoogleTest's assertion framework:

- Start simple with common assertions like `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE`.
- Use floating-point assertions (`EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, etc.) for numerical computations that require tolerance.
- Employ string-specific assertions for C strings.
- For complex conditions, leverage predicate assertions or `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers.
- Add custom failure messages for context.
- Prefer `EXPECT_` assertions when possible to gather all failures, resorting to `ASSERT_` when test continuation is unsafe.

### Example: Using Assertions in Practice

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, SquareRoot) {
  double x = sqrt(16.0);

  // Check approximate equality due to floating-point arithmetic
  EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(x, 4.0) << "Square root of 16 should be 4";

  // Intentionally failing assertion with custom message
  ASSERT_NE(x, 5.0) << "Square root of 16 should NOT be 5";

  // This line will be skipped if the above ASSERT_NE fails
  EXPECT_TRUE(x > 3.0);
}
```

## Explicit Success and Failure Assertions

Sometimes your test logic requires asserting success or failure explicitly:

- `SUCCEED()` generates a success event; useful as documentation or control flow assertion.
- `FAIL()` generates a fatal failure and aborts the current function immediately.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` generates a non-fatal failure but lets the test continue.

### Example: Using `FAIL()` for Unexpected Code Paths

```cpp
switch(state) {
  case State::Ready:
    // test code
    break;
  case State::Error:
    FAIL() << "Unexpected error state encountered.";
}
```

## Using Matchers with Assertions

The `EXPECT_THAT` and `ASSERT_THAT` macros enable expressive and flexible condition verification by combining values with matchers:

- Example: `EXPECT_THAT(value, Ge(10));`
- Powerful for complex types, containers, and custom predicates

This improves the readability and diagnostic quality over plain boolean expressions.

---

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Set expectations clearly:** Distinguish when to use fatal vs. non-fatal for your test's logic.
- **Avoid over-specification:** Don't assert all internal behaviors unless needed.
- **Custom messages:** Always provide enough context to make failing tests easier to debug.
- **Floating-point comparisons:** Never use `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_EQ` for floats or doubles without tolerance.
- **Death tests:** Use carefully, as they spawn processes and can introduce test fragility.
- **Test isolation:** Each test should be self-contained; clean up or reset states to avoid cross-test interference.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Assertion Issues

### Problem: Tests unexpectedly abort early

- **Cause:** Fatal assertion failure (`ASSERT_*`) triggered.
- **Resolution:** Confirm if critical test steps require immediate abort; otherwise, switch to non-fatal assertions.

### Problem: Unexpected assertion failures on floating-point values

- **Cause:** Using plain equality for floats/doubles.
- **Resolution:** Use `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`, or `EXPECT_NEAR` with appropriate tolerances.

### Problem: Test produces many assertion failures yet only first is relevant

- **Cause:** Overuse of `EXPECT_` where `ASSERT_` is more appropriate.
- **Resolution:** Use `ASSERT_` to protect critical code paths.

### Problem: Assertion outputs lack context

- **Cause:** Missing custom failure messages.
- **Resolution:** Add descriptive messages using `<<` operator for assertions.
