# Integration Patterns & Extensibility

GoogleTest shines not only as a powerful unit testing and mocking framework but also as a highly adaptable tool that fits seamlessly into your existing C++ development workflows. This page focuses on how you can integrate GoogleTest into diverse build environments and continuous integration (CI) systems, extend its capabilities through event listeners and custom runners, and embed it effectively within various C++ application contexts — from desktop to embedded platforms.

---

## 1. Integrating GoogleTest with Build and CI Systems

### Why Integrate?
Including GoogleTest in your build and CI pipelines ensures your tests are run automatically and reliably as part of your development lifecycle, accelerating feedback and improving code quality.

### Common Build Systems
- **CMake Integration**
  - Add GoogleTest and GoogleMock as dependencies to your CMake project.
  - Link your test executables against these libraries.
  - Enable GoogleTest test discovery by including `gtest_discover_tests()`.

- **Bazel Integration**
  - Use Bazel rules to incorporate GoogleTest binaries.
  - Declare `cc_test` targets pointing to your test sources.
  - Manage dependencies cleanly within Bazel’s WORKSPACE and BUILD files.

### CI Pipeline Examples
- Configure your CI (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to:
  - Build with GoogleTest enabled.
  - Run the test binaries, capturing XML or JSON output.
  - Process test results to provide detailed reports and failure alerts.

### Practical Example: CMake Setup
```cmake
add_subdirectory(googletest)
add_executable(my_tests test_main.cc test_foo.cc)
target_link_libraries(my_tests gtest gmock pthread)
gtest_discover_tests(my_tests)
```

### Tips
- Keep GoogleTest sources and binaries consistent with your project’s C++ standard and compiler.
- Use test sharding and parallel execution features to speed up large test suites.

## 2. Extending GoogleTest via Event Listeners and Custom Runners

### Event Listeners
GoogleTest supports event listeners that respond to key test lifecycle events, such as test start, success, failure, and end:

- **Use Cases:** Logging custom information, integrating with external test reporting tools, adjusting test behaviors dynamically.

- **How to Implement:**
  - Derive from `::testing::TestEventListener`.
  - Override event methods like `OnTestStart()`, `OnTestEnd()`, `OnTestPartResult()`.
  - Register your listener using `::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners()->Append()`.

### Custom Test Runners
- While GoogleTest’s default runner fulfills most needs, you can implement custom test runners if you want to:
  - Change test filtering or execution order beyond what flags allow.
  - Integrate test runs deeply into specialized environments.

- Most users will find event listeners and the existing filtering sufficient.

### Example: Basic Event Listener
```cpp
class MyLogger : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting test: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished test: " << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};

// In main or setup:
::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners()->Append(new MyLogger);
```

## 3. Embedding GoogleTest in Diverse C++ Environments

### Desktop Applications
- GoogleTest works naturally with desktop platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Integrate seamlessly with your IDE and debugger to get rich feedback.
- Use `gtest_main` or custom main functions to integrate tests.

### Embedded Systems
- GoogleTest supports embedded platforms, assuming the compiler and runtime supports C++17.
- For resource-constrained environments:
  - Use subset compilations to include only necessary parts.
  - Redirect test outputs to serial ports, logs, or debugging consoles.
  - Integrate GoogleTest builds with specialized embedded toolchains.

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- GoogleTest abstracts platform differences where possible.
- Use portability configuration macros documented in [Portability & Configuration](https://google.github.io/googletest/api/advanced_extensions/portability_configuration.html).

### Best Practices for Embedding
- Isolate tests from production code dependencies.
- Use mock objects extensively to simulate hardware dependencies.
- Consider integration with embedded emulators during testing.

---

## 4. Best Practices

- **Set Clear Integration Goals:** Decide early how tests fit into your build and deployment pipeline.
- **Use ON_CALL and EXPECT_CALL Judiciously:** See the [gMock for Dummies](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html) guide for mocking best practices.
- **Keep Extensions Simple:** Custom listeners should avoid complex logic that can slow down test runs.
- **Monitor Test Performance:** Integrate with your build system to detect regressions in test execution time.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- Integration problems often arise from build misconfiguration; ensure libraries and include paths are correctly set.
- On embedded platforms, watch for missing runtime features required by GoogleTest.
- Unclear error messages during mock setup often relate to method virtualness or signature mismatches.
- Use verbose logging flags (`--gmock_verbose=info`) to diagnose unexpected test behaviors.
