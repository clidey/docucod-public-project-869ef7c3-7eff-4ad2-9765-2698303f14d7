# Test Discovery and Execution Lifecycle

GoogleTest automates the entire lifecycle of testing, from discovering tests in your codebase to running them efficiently and reporting detailed results. This guide unpacks the key concepts behind this lifecycle and helps you understand how GoogleTest manages your tests under the hood while focusing exclusively on meeting your testing goals.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery

When you write tests with GoogleTest, you don’t have to manually register or invoke them. GoogleTest discovers all tests automatically during program initialization. This powerful feature means you simply define your tests using macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, and GoogleTest gathers them all for execution.

### How Test Registration Works

- Each `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macro invocation creates a unique test identity composed of a test suite name and test name. 
- Behind the scenes, each test registers itself with GoogleTest’s central registry — a singleton called `UnitTest`. 
- Test registration occurs *before* `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called, allowing GoogleTest to know all tests available in the binary.

### Flexible Test Filters

GoogleTest supports powerful test selection filters, letting you run exactly the tests you want.

- Filters match tests by full name: `TestSuiteName.TestName`.
- You can specify positive and negative filters:
  - Example: `--gtest_filter=MySuite.*:-MySuite.FlakyTest` runs all tests in `MySuite` except `FlakyTest`.
- Disabled tests are excluded unless you enable them explicitly with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

This means you can target tests interactively or automate selective test runs in CI pipelines.

## Test Setup, Execution, and Teardown

GoogleTest orchestrates setup and teardown at **three levels** to give you full control over resource management.

### 1. Global Environments

- Subclass `::testing::Environment` to define global setup/teardown logic.
- Register environments via `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()`.
- `Environment::SetUp()` runs once before **all tests/iterations**.
- `Environment::TearDown()` runs once after **all tests/iterations**.
- When tests are repeated (via `--gtest_repeat`), environments can be recreated per iteration if `--gtest_recreate_environments_when_repeating` is true.

### 2. Test Suite Setup and Teardown

- Each test suite (group of related tests) can share expensive resources.
- Define static methods `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` in your test fixture class.
- Called **once before the first test** and **after the last test** in the suite, respectively.

### 3. Individual Test Setup and Teardown

- Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` instance methods in your test fixture.
- Runs freshly for each test.
- GoogleTest creates a *dedicated* fixture object for every test to ensure isolation.

### User Flow for Running a Test

For each test to run, GoogleTest performs these steps:

1. Create test fixture instance.
2. Call `SetUp()`.
3. Invoke the test method body (`TestBody()`).
4. Call `TearDown()`.
5. Destroy the fixture instance.

If a fatal failure occurs at any stage, GoogleTest skips remaining steps for that test.

---

## Test Execution Lifecycle

The entire lifecycle of executing tests, including repetitions and event notification, happens in a well-defined order.

### Iterations and Repetition

- Tests can be run repeatedly using the `--gtest_repeat` flag (default is 1).
- For each iteration:
  - Global environments are set up.
  - Test suites and tests are run.
  - Global environments are torn down.
- This allows stress testing or uncovering flaky tests by executing them multiple times.

### Event Listeners Notify Every Phase

GoogleTest provides an event hook system so you can track testing progress precisely using listeners. They receive callbacks at the following stages:

- Program start and end.
- Each test iteration start and end.
- Environment setup and teardown start and end.
- Test suite (and legacy test case) start and end.
- Individual test start and end.
- Test assertion results (successes, failures).

Use this API to customize reporting or implement diagnostics.

---

## Reporting Results

After a test runs, GoogleTest collects detailed results for reporting:

- **TestPartResults** correspond to individual assertions or explicit success/fail calls within tests.
- **TestResult** summarizes all parts and aggregates failures, skips, and execution times.
- Tests are marked as passed, failed, skipped, or disabled based on outcomes.
- Test suite and overall program status are computed accordingly.

### Accessing Results Programmatically

You can use reflection APIs during or after test runs to query:

- Names and statuses of tests/suites.
- Execution times and failures.
- User-recorded properties.

This enables post-processing or integration with CI dashboards.

### XML and JSON Reports

GoogleTest can emit rich XML or JSON test reports for machine consumption via the `--gtest_output` flag.

## Practical Example: Understanding Lifecycle Events

Invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` triggers these high-level activities in sequence:

```none
1. OnTestProgramStart
2. For each iteration (e.g., 2 iterations):
    a. OnTestIterationStart
    b. OnEnvironmentsSetUpStart
    c. Environment SetUp
    d. OnEnvironmentsSetUpEnd
    e. For each test suite:
        i. OnTestSuiteStart
       ii. SetUpTestSuite
      iii. For each test:
            - OnTestStart
            - SetUp
            - TestBody
            - TearDown
            - OnTestEnd
       iv. TearDownTestSuite
        v. OnTestSuiteEnd
    f. OnEnvironmentsTearDownStart
    g. Environment TearDown
    h. OnEnvironmentsTearDownEnd
    i. OnTestIterationEnd
3. OnTestProgramEnd
```

This ordering ensures setup and teardown happen in the correct order, and that your event listeners receive consistent notifications.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Leverage test fixtures** to share resources and keep tests clean and isolated.
- Use **value- or type-parameterized tests** to multiply your coverage with less code duplication.
- Apply **filters** to focus runs on relevant tests, especially in large codebases.
- Use **event listeners** to customize output or gather runtime metrics.
- Enable **repeat** and **shuffle** modes to catch flakiness and hidden dependencies.
- Avoid brittle dependencies between tests by not relying on test order.
- When implementing environments, remember that `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` run at test program level.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Lifecycle Issues

- If no tests run, verify that tests are properly defined with `TEST`, `TEST_F`, or registered dynamically.
- Confirm filters are not excluding all tests.
- Make sure to call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- Disabled tests (names starting with `DISABLED_`) are skipped unless enabled.
- For flaky tests, use `--gtest_repeat` and `--gtest_shuffle` to identify timing/order dependencies.
