# Mocking Fundamentals

Mocking is a cornerstone technique in modern C++ unit testing, enabling you to isolate code under test by simulating its dependencies. This page delves into the fundamental concepts of mocking using GoogleMock: how test doubles are created, how you declare mock classes, monitor calls, and verify expectations. It also explains the lifecycle of mocks and why mocking is essential in crafting effective unit tests.

## Understanding Mocking in C++

Imagine you are developing a complex system where components interact with external services or modules. Directly using these dependencies in tests can make your tests slow, unreliable, or hard to set up. Mocking helps here by creating *test doubles* — objects that imitate the interfaces of real dependencies but allow you to control and observe their behavior.

GoogleMock streamlines this process by automatically generating mock classes from your interfaces and providing a fluent syntax to specify their behavior and call expectations.

---

## Why Use GoogleMock?

GoogleMock is designed specifically to alleviate the challenges of manual mocking in C++. It brings several compelling advantages:

- **Automatic Mock Class Generation:** No more tedious hand-coding of mock implementations.
- **Rich, Readable Syntax:** Easy to declare expectations, specify behaviors, and verify call sequences.
- **Precise Interaction Testing:** Verify that your code interacts with its dependencies exactly as expected.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Catch incorrect usage of dependencies the moment it occurs during test execution.
- **Supports Complex C++ Features:** Handles overloads, const methods, noexcept, and calling conventions.

## Declaring Mock Classes

The first step is to define mock classes from your abstract interfaces. Suppose you have a graphics drawing API defined by an interface `Turtle`:

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void Turn(int degrees) = 0;
  virtual void GoTo(int x, int y) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
  virtual int GetY() const = 0;
};
```

To create a mock, follow these steps:

1. Derive a mock class from this interface.
2. Use the `MOCK_METHOD` macro inside the public section of your mock class to declare each virtual method you want to mock.
3. Add qualifiers such as `(const, override)` as needed.

Example:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Turn, (int degrees), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, GoTo, (int x, int y), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetY, (), (const, override));
};
```

Notice:

- All mock methods must be placed in `public:` — this ensures you can set expectations and default behaviors externally.
- If your methods have commas in their argument types (e.g., templates with multiple parameters), wrap those argument types in additional parentheses or use type aliases.

---

## Using Mock Objects in Tests

With your mock class ready, you can write tests that:

1. Create mock objects.
2. Define expectations on method calls, including arguments, call counts, and return behaviors.
3. Exercise the system under test.
4. Automatically verify that your expectations have been met.

Example usage:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Return;

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsShapeCorrectly) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  // Expect PenDown() to be called at least once.
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown())
      .Times(AtLeast(1));

  Painter painter(&turtle);  // Your production code uses the turtle.

  bool success = painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10);
  EXPECT_TRUE(success);
}
```

Key insights:

- `EXPECT_CALL` declares an expectation that a mock method will be called.
- You specify *how many times* the call is expected (e.g., `Times(AtLeast(1))`).
- You can specify *what* arguments are expected using [matchers](../reference/matchers.md).
- GoogleMock verifies all expectations during mock destruction; if any expectation isn't met, the test fails, providing detailed error messages.

---

## Monitoring and Verifying Function Calls

GoogleMock lets you observe and control the details of method calls through a powerful and expressive syntax.

### Matchers

Matchers specify which arguments your mock methods are expected to be called with. Use:

- Exact values, e.g., `Forward(100)` expects the function to be called with 100.
- Wildcards `_` to ignore arguments.
- Complex predicates such as `Ge(5)` to expect arguments greater or equal to 5.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GoTo(50, _));  // First argument must be 50; second can be anything
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(Ge(100)));  // Forward called with at least 100
```

### Cardinalities

You can specify how many times a method is expected to be called:

- `Times(n)` - exact `n` times.
- `AtLeast(n)` - at least `n` times.
- `AtMost(n)` - at most `n` times.
- `Between(m, n)` - between `m` and `n` times.
- `AnyNumber()` - any number of times.

You can disallow calls using `Times(0)`.

### Actions

Actions define what your mock method should do when called. By default, mock methods return default values suitable for their return types.

You can override this behavior using:

- `WillOnce()` to specify behavior for specific calls.
- `WillRepeatedly()` for the repeated calls after `WillOnce()` actions are exhausted.

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
    .WillOnce(Return(100))
    .WillOnce(Return(150))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(200));
```

This says:
- The first call to `GetX()` returns 100.
- The second call returns 150.
- Subsequent calls return 200.

## Conceptual Lifecycle of a Mock

A GoogleMock mock goes through the following stages:

1. **Creation:** You instantiate a mock object from your mock class.
2. **Expectation Setup:** You define `EXPECT_CALL` statements describing which methods are expected to be called, with what parameters, how often, and what should happen when called.
3. **Exercise Code:** You run your production code that uses the mock as a dependency.
4. **Verification:** GoogleMock monitors the calls in real-time and at the end of the test verifies that all expectations were met.
5. **Destruction:** The mock object is destroyed; if expectations were unmet, a test failure is reported here.

**Important:** Expectations must be set *before* the mock methods are called. Setting expectations after usage leads to undefined behavior.

---

## Strictness and Uninteresting Calls

By default, if a mock method is called without a matching `EXPECT_CALL`, GoogleMock considers it an *uninteresting call* and will issue a warning but not fail the test. 

You can adjust this behavior using `NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, or `StrictMock` wrappers:

- **NiceMock**: suppress warnings on uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock**: (default) warns on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

Example:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockTurtle> nice_turtle;
StrictMock<MockTurtle> strict_turtle;
```

Use these strictness levels wisely:

- Use `NiceMock` when you want less noisy tests and are not interested in every call.
- Use `StrictMock` when you want to strictly enforce all interactions.

---

## Best Practices and Pitfalls

- **Mock only interfaces you own.** If you must mock a third-party interface, consider creating an adaptor.
- **Set expectations carefully:** Strict or overly-specific expectations can cause brittle tests.
- **Use `ON_CALL` for defaults, `EXPECT_CALL` for verification:** `ON_CALL` sets default behaviors for calls you don’t care to verify.
- **Avoid expectations after usage:** Always declare expectations before exercising the mock.
- **Use sequences (`InSequence`) to enforce call order when necessary.**
- **Retire expectations when saturated** using `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to prevent upper-bound violations.

---

## Example: Putting it All Together

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::InSequence;

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

TEST(DrawingTest, DrawsStraightLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  {
    InSequence s;  // Enforce the order
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
    EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
  }

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
      .WillRepeatedly(Return(0));

  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawLine(0, 0, 100, 0));
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Make sure virtual destructors exist in interfaces you mock.
- Use `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed call traces helpful for diagnosing unmet expectations.
- Remember expectations must be set before mock methods are called.
- Beware of sticky expectations: use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to retire expectations after their cardinality is met.
- If mock methods with no expectations cause warnings you don’t want, consider wrapping your mock in a `NiceMock`.

---

## Summary

Mocking in GoogleMock is a declarative, expressive mechanism enabling precise verification and control of mocked interfaces’ behavior. By defining mock classes with `MOCK_METHOD`, setting expectations via `EXPECT_CALL`, and optionally customizing call behavior with actions, you craft robust, maintainable unit tests isolating your code from external dependencies.
