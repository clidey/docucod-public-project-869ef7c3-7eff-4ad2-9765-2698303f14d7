# Matchers and Flexible Assertions

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide a deep and expressive system of **matchers** that let you specify expectations about function call arguments, return values, and general assertions with unprecedented readability and flexibility. Matchers transform hard-to-read equality tests and argument checks into clear, maintainable, and domain-specific language constructs.

## Understanding Matchers

### What is a Matcher?

A matcher is a predicate-like object that expresses the conditions expected of a value. Think of it as a question you ask about an argument: “Does this argument satisfy this condition?” Matchers are more powerful than simple equality: they can match ranges, patterns, properties, and complex compositions.

You can use matchers wherever you need to express expected argument values in mock expectations or write assertions with `EXPECT_THAT`.

### Matcher Examples

- The simple matcher `_` matches **anything** — a wildcard.
- A matcher like `Eq(5)` matches exactly 5.
- Range matchers like `Ge(3)` match any value greater than or equal to 3.
- Compound matchers like `AllOf(Gt(5), Lt(10))` match values greater than 5 **and** less than 10.

### Why Use Matchers?

Matchers offer benefits far beyond `EXPECT_EQ` or `ASSERT_TRUE`:

- **Expressivity:** Read like English, conveying intent clearly.
- **Flexibility:** Compose intricate constraints seamlessly.
- **Maintainability:** Avoid brittle tests tied too tightly to exact values.
- **Reusability:** Define custom matchers for domain-specific validations.

## Core Matcher Categories

### Value Matchers

Matchers that test a single value:

- `Eq(value)`: equals
- `Ne(value)`: not equals
- `Lt(value)`, `Le(value)`, `Gt(value)`, `Ge(value)`: relational comparisons
- `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`: pointer nullity
- `That(predicate)`: custom unary predicate

### String Matchers

Helpful for matching strings in a flexible manner:

- `StrEq(str)`: exact string equality
- `StrCaseEq(str)`: equality ignoring case
- `HasSubstr(substring)`: contains substring
- `StartsWith(prefix)`, `EndsWith(suffix)`: prefix or suffix matching

### Container Matchers

Designed for STL containers or arrays, with ability to match sequence contents:

- `ElementsAre(...)`: container elements match in order
- `UnorderedElementsAre(...)`: elements match in any order
- `Each(matcher)`: all elements match the matcher
- `Contains(matcher)`: at least one element matches
- `Pointwise(pair_matcher, container)`: element-wise correspondence

### Object Member Matchers

Allow matching properties or fields within objects:

- `Field(&Class::member, matcher)`: member variable matches
- `Property(&Class::getter, matcher)`: result of getter method matches

### Composite Matchers

Combine other matchers logically:

- `AllOf(m1, m2, ...)`: all matchers must match
- `AnyOf(m1, m2, ...)`: at least one matches
- `Not(m)`: negates matcher

---

## Using Matchers in GoogleMock

Matchers are essential when setting up `EXPECT_CALL` or `ON_CALL` for mock methods. They let you specify precisely what argument values you expect.

```cpp
using ::testing::_;  // matches anything
using ::testing::Ge;
using ::testing::HasSubstr;
using ::testing::Return;
...
EXPECT_CALL(mockObject, SomeMethod(Ge(5), HasSubstr("needle")))
    .WillOnce(Return(true));
```

If you omit specifying matchers, the special matcher `_` is implied for all arguments of non-overloaded methods.

### Combining and Customizing Matchers

You can combine matchers logically to create sophisticated conditions:

```cpp
using ::testing::AllOf;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Ne;
using ::testing::Not;

EXPECT_CALL(obj, Func(AllOf(Gt(10), Not(Ne(15)))));
```

This expects the argument to be greater than 10 and equal to 15.

### Matching Complex Argument Structures

Matchers also can target nested structures:

- `Field(&MyClass::member, matcher)` allows verifying a member variable within an object.
- `Property(&MyClass::GetterFunc, matcher)` matches based on return value of a getter.

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoSomething(Field(&MyClass::age, Ge(18))));
```

This expects a `MyClass` argument with `age >= 18`.

### Matching Pointer Arguments with `Pointee`

When you want to match the value pointed to by a pointer argument, use `Pointee`:

```cpp
using ::testing::Pointee;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(Pointee(Ge(3))));  // pointer points to value >= 3
```

`Pointee` transparently works with raw pointers and smart pointers such as `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`.

### Matching Multiple Arguments Together

Sometimes you want to express relationships between multiple arguments. Use `.With()` clause in `EXPECT_CALL`:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(Ne(0), _))
    .With(Lt());  // The first argument must be less than second
```

Or use `Args<>` to select specific arguments:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(_, _, _))
    .With(Args<0,2>(Gt()));  // Arg0 > Arg2
```

---

## Writing Custom Matchers

### Quick and Easy: `MATCHER` Macros

GoogleMock supplies `MATCHER` macros to define quick custom matchers:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsEven, "is an even number") {
  return (arg % 2) == 0;
}

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Func(IsEven()));
```

For parameterized matchers:

```cpp
MATCHER_P(IsDivisibleBy, divisor, "is divisible by") {
  return (arg % divisor) == 0;
}

EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy(3));
```

### Advanced Matcher Classes

For richer control and better error messages, implement matcher classes with:

- `MatchAndExplain()` method: returns bool, explains failure
- `DescribeTo()` and `DescribeNegationTo()` to describe expected condition

Then provide a factory function returning `testing::Matcher<T>`.

### Best Practice for Custom Matchers

- Keep matchers **pure**; they cannot cause side effects.
- Provide detailed failure explanations for improved debugging.
- Use the `result_listener` to stream diagnostic messages.

---

## Using Matchers in Assertions

Matchers power the `EXPECT_THAT` and `ASSERT_THAT` macros.

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
using ::testing::StartsWith;
...
EXPECT_THAT(name, StartsWith("John"));
EXPECT_THAT(values, ElementsAre(1, 2, 3));
```

They allow expressive, readable conditions with rich error messages when failures occur.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Use `_` wildcard matcher selectively to avoid over-constraining tests.
- Favor `ON_CALL` for default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` only when verifying call counts or orders.
- Use `NiceMock` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls where behavior is not under test.
- Avoid mixing multiple detailed expectations on the same method without clear intent to reduce brittleness.
- Leverage sequences (`InSequence`) for ordered call expectations.
- If matching complex objects, consider `Field` and `Property` matchers instead of matching entire objects.
- Use matchers in combination with GoogleTest assertions (`EXPECT_THAT`) for consistent expressive test code.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Matcher Issues

- **Type mismatches:** Use `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)` to resolve type conversion issues between matchers and argument types.
- **Overloaded functions:** Disambiguate overloads using wrappers like `Const()` or typed matchers (`TypedEq<T>()`).
- **Too strict expectations:** Inappropriate use of detailed matchers can make tests break unnecessarily during refactoring.
- **Matcher side-effects:** Always ensure custom matchers do not cause side effects or depend on external state.

---

## Summary

Matchers in GoogleTest and GoogleMock create a powerful domain-specific language for specifying test expectations. They bridge the gap between raw values and rich expressive test constraints, enabling clear, maintainable, and robust tests. The system supports built-in matchers, composition, custom definitions, and seamless integration into assertions and mocks.
