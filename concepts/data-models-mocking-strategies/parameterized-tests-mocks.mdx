# Parameterized Testing and Mock Strategies

Explore core strategies for value-parameterized and type-parameterized tests, and recommended practices for organizing parameterized mocks to maximize coverage and reusability.

## Introduction to Parameterized Testing in GoogleTest

Parameterized tests are a powerful feature in GoogleTest that allow you to write a **single test logic** that runs multiple times with different input values or types. This approach helps you avoid repetitive code, improve coverage, and express test intent more clearly.

GoogleTest supports two major approaches to parameterization:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests:** Run the same test body with a range of different values.
- **Type-Parameterized Tests:** Run tests generically for multiple types.

Alongside these, GoogleMock offers strategies to effectively mock objects in parameterized contexts, ensuring your mocks remain maintainable and correctly instrumented.

## Value-Parameterized Tests

### Concept

Value-parameterized tests let you define a test suite once, and provide a **set of values** that the test will run against independently. This is ideal when you want to verify behavior over a variety of input values.

### Creating Value-Parameterized Tests

To write a value-parameterized test:

1. Derive your test fixture from `::testing::TestWithParam<T>`, where `T` is the type of your test parameter.
2. Define your tests with `TEST_P`, accessing the parameter with `GetParam()`.
3. Generate test instances with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`, using parameter generators like `Values()`, `Range()`, or `Combine()`.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class FactorialTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<int> {
};

TEST_P(FactorialTest, HandlesVariousInputs) {
  int n = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GE(Factorial(n), 1);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    PositiveNumbers, FactorialTest, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 8));
```

### Parameter Generators

GoogleTest provides various ways to generate test parameters:

- `Values(v1, v2, ...)` yields listed values.
- `Range(begin, end [, step])` yields values from `begin` up to but not including `end`, stepping by `step`.
- `Bool()` yields `{false, true}`.
- `Combine(g1, g2, ..., gN)` yields a Cartesian product of multiple generators, producing tuples.
- `ValuesIn(container_or_range)` yields values from iterable containers or iterator ranges.

### Naming Instantiations

You can specify custom names for individual test cases within an instantiation by providing a name generator. This improves test output readability:

```cpp
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    MyInst, MyTestSuite, ::testing::Values(1, 2, 3),
    [](const ::testing::TestParamInfo<int>& info) {
      return "Param_" + std::to_string(info.param);
    });
```

### Best Practices

- Avoid over-parameterization; keep each test focused on verifying a single concept.
- Use `Combine()` to test combinations while keeping parameter sets manageable.
- Choose parameter types that make test intent clear.

## Type-Parameterized Tests

### Concept

Type-parameterized tests allow you to run the same tests for different **types**. This is ideal when you want to validate the behavior of a class or function template over many types without duplicating code.

### Defining Type-Parameterized Tests

Steps to create type-parameterized tests:

1. Write a class template test fixture inheriting from `::testing::Test`.
2. Use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()` to associate the fixture with a type list.
3. Write tests using `TYPED_TEST()` accessing the type via the `TypeParam` typedef.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyContainerTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  T container;
};

typedef ::testing::Types<std::vector<int>, std::list<int>> Implementations;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyContainerTest, Implementations);

TYPED_TEST(MyContainerTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(this->container.size(), 0);
}
```

### Type-Parameterized Test Regimens

- `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` defines the types at once.
- `TYPED_TEST` defines individual tests.
- `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` and `INSTANTIATE_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` allow for advanced usage where types and tests are registered separately.

### Recommendations

- Use clear type lists reflecting the most relevant types.
- Utilize type traits inside tests if necessary for conditional logic.
- Prefer type-parameterized tests when varying input *types*, and value-parameterized tests when varying input *values*.

## Organizing Parameterized Mocks

### Importance of Reusable Mocks

When testing parameterized scenarios, managing mocks carefully is essential to avoid duplication and to maximize clarity and correctness.

### Creating Parameterized Mock Classes

- **Avoid replicating mock classes for every parameter type or value.** Instead, use template mock classes where possible.

Example:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MockStack : public StackInterface<T> {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Push, (const T& x), (override));
};
```

- For value parameters that affect mock behavior, use parameterized test fixtures that initialize mocks accordingly.

### Delegating Mock Behavior Based on Parameters

To maximize reusability:

- Use `ON_CALL()` to set up default mock behaviors dynamically based on the current parameter.
- Use `EXPECT_CALL()` within individual tests to specify expected calls for each parameter case.

### Practical Tips

- Define mock classes in a common header shared by all test variations.
- Use helper functions in fixtures to configure mocks as per parameters.
- Avoid hardcoding expectations inside mock classes; instead, drive expectations from the test logic.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overly Strict Expectations:** Setting too strict expectations for all parameter variations can cause brittle tests.
- **Overlapping Expectations:** Be aware that later `EXPECT_CALL`s override earlier ones on the same mock method; ordering matters.
- **Destruction and Verification:** Ensure mocks are destroyed properly in fixtures to trigger expectation verification.

## Example: Combining Value-Parameterized Tests with Mocks

```cpp
class MockCalculator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), (const));
};

class CalculatorTest : public ::testing::TestWithParam<std::tuple<int, int, int>> {
 protected:
  MockCalculator mock_calc;
};

TEST_P(CalculatorTest, AddsCorrectly) {
  int a = std::get<0>(GetParam());
  int b = std::get<1>(GetParam());
  int expected = std::get<2>(GetParam());

  EXPECT_CALL(mock_calc, Add(a, b)).WillOnce(::testing::Return(expected));

  int result = mock_calc.Add(a, b);
  EXPECT_EQ(result, expected);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    AddTests, CalculatorTest,
    ::testing::Values(
        std::make_tuple(1, 2, 3),
        std::make_tuple(-1, 1, 0),
        std::make_tuple(5, 7, 12)));
```

This example shows how to parameterize tests with values to verify expected mock behavior across multiple scenarios.

## Troubleshooting Parameterized Tests with Mocks

| Issue                                      | Cause                                                     | Solution                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Tests fail unexpectedly for some parameters | Expectations not correctly reset between parameters         | Ensure mocks are properly wiped/recreated between tests or use fresh fixtures for each test invocation |
| Mock method ambiguity with overloaded methods| Overloaded method resolution is unclear with parameterized tests| Use `testing::An<Type>()` or `testing::Matcher<Type>()` to disambiguate matchers |
| Test names are difficult to read or collide | Default parameter names are cryptic or duplicated           | Provide explicit test name generators in `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` |

## Summary

Parameterized tests unlock expressive, concise test cases with broad coverage. When combined with carefully designed mock classes that support templating and dynamic behavior configuration, your testing becomes more robust, maintainable, and efficient.

Consider your needs - value variations or type variations - and apply the appropriate parameterization supported by GoogleTest. Use techniques such as delegated mock default actions (`ON_CALL`) to keep your mocks flexible and your tests readable.
