# Scalability & Performance Considerations

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are powerful frameworks for testing C++ code, and while they are designed to handle tests at different scales efficiently, large projects introduce unique challenges around performance and scalability. This guide focuses specifically on helping you understand and optimize key factors that affect your test suite's responsiveness and maintainability in bigger codebases that utilize GoogleTest and GoogleMock.

## Test Discovery and Execution Strategies

In large projects, discovering and running tests efficiently becomes critical. GoogleTest employs a runtime test registration mechanism that automatically discovers tests defined via macros like `TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, and `TYPED_TEST`. This mechanism ensures that:

- Test registration is lightweight and occurs before test execution, minimizing startup overhead.
- Execution order is flexible and can be filtered or shuffled.

However, as the number of tests grows, naive execution may cause unacceptable delay during test runs.

### Best Practices for Managing Test Discovery and Execution

- **Selective Test Running:** Use GoogleTest's powerful filtering flags such as `--gtest_filter` to run only relevant subsets of tests during iterative development or CI cycles.
- **Parallelism:** Leverage parallel test execution strategies either via GoogleTest's shard support (`GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`) or external test runners to run tests concurrently.
- **Test Suite Setup/TearDown Reuse:** Reduce redundant setup costs by utilizing `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to share expensive resources across tests.

### Parameterized Tests at Scale

Parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) allow you to run the same test logic across numerous data points. While immensely valuable, scaling parameterized tests introduces potential performance pitfalls:

- **Explosion of Test Cases:** Each parameter generates a distinct test case, so a large parameter list rapidly multiplies the number of tests.
- **Test Naming and Reporting Overhead:** More test instances increase the metadata GoogleTest maintains, impacting startup and reporting time.

### Tips for Parameterized Tests

- **Use concise yet distinctive parameter names:** This reduces overhead in logs and reports while keeping traceability.
- **Prefer combining parameters only as required:** Overusing `Combine()` or `ValuesIn()` can cause combinatorial explosion.
- **Prune Parameter Sets:** Limit parameters to meaningful subsets for faster, focused test cycles.

## Efficient Mock Design to Maintain Performance

Mocks are central to interaction-based testing but can negatively impact test performance if not designed carefully. GoogleMock's internal call dispatch and expectation matching are optimized but can degrade with excessive complexity.

### Mock Design Patterns for Scalability

1. **Minimize Mock Interface Surface:** Mock only what you need to verify. Reducing mock methods lessens overhead in expectation tracking.

2. **Default Behaviors via `ON_CALL`:** Setting default actions via `ON_CALL` reduces the need for many `EXPECT_CALL` statements, thereby reducing match overhead.

3. **Use Nice and Strict Modes Judiciously:** The strictness mode affects how uninteresting calls are reported; managing this setting properly helps avoid overwhelming warnings or missed errors that could slow debugging.

4. **Leverage Sequences and Partial Orderings:** Use `InSequence` and `.After()` clauses to explicitly specify call order only when needed, avoiding overly complex tracking logic.

5. **Optimize Expectations:** Avoid creating many fine-grained expectations without necessity, as each adds to match complexity.

6. **Avoid Excessive WillOnce Chains:** While `WillOnce` action chains are powerful, too many chained actions increase state complexity and can slow expectation resolution.

7. **Reuse Mocks When Appropriate:** Creating mocks in test fixtures to share across multiple tests reduces instantiation overhead.

### Performance Tips for Mock-Heavy Tests

- **Prefer `WillRepeatedly` for Repetitive Behavior:** Avoid using multiple `WillOnce` actions when a repeated action suffices.

- **Retire Expectations on Saturation:** Use `.RetiresOnSaturation()` to free expectations once fully satisfied, limiting match attempts.

- **Use Custom Matchers Wisely:** Complex matchers can slow down matching; prefer simple matchers or implement fast custom matchers.

- **Reduce Verbosity During Tests:** Set `--gmock_verbose=error` in CI and performance-sensitive environments to reduce logging overhead.

## Understanding the Cost of Expectation Matching

GoogleMock matches mock function calls against expectations from the newest to oldest, stopping on the first match. While efficient in normal cases, cumulative or overlapping expectations can cause:

- Increased matching time due to many layers of expectations.
- Higher memory usage to manage expectations.

### Recommendations

- Order your expectations placing the most common or specific matches last to optimize early matching.
- Combine related expectations where possible.
- Avoid expectations that apply to broad argument matchers with narrow expectations that shadow them frequently.

## Managing Test Suite Size and Runtime

Large test suites can impact developer productivity and CI pipeline throughput. Consider:

- **Sharding:** Split your tests into shards using GoogleTest's environment variables to parallelize across machines or CI agents.
- **Test Timeout and Stability:** Avoid flaky tests and long-running tests that block pipelines.
- **Skimming Over Uninteresting Calls:** Use `NiceMock` to reduce unnecessary warnings and speed up test output parsing.

## Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Performance and Scalability Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Overly Strict Expectations Leading to Fragile Tests">
Setting exact call counts without `.RetiresOnSaturation()`, or overly rigid sequences, can yield brittle tests that fail with simple refactors and incur extra overhead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Excessive or Unnecessary `EXPECT_CALL` Statements">
Having a large number of expectations on one mock or across tests causes matching overhead and slows down test execution.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Overuse of Parameterized Tests Leading to Combinatorial Explosion">
Uncontrolled combinatorial parameter sets can cause large numbers of tests and slow startup/test times.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Verbose Mock Logging Impacting Performance">
High verbosity levels (`--gmock_verbose=info`) can slow test runs; use warning or error levels in CI.
</Accordion>

## Summary

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide comprehensive capabilities for large-scale test suites, but achieving high performance and scalability requires understanding and applying best practices in test discovery, parameterized test usage, mock design, and expectation management. By judicious use of filtering, parallelism, mock configuration, and avoidance of overly complex expectations, you can keep your test suite efficient and maintainable.

#set of key takeaways

- Use `ON_CALL` for default behavior and `EXPECT_CALL` only when you want to verify calls.
- Control test scope and execution via filters and sharding to manage large test suites.
- Sequence your expectations carefully and retire them when saturated to minimize matching overhead.
- Parameterize tests with an eye toward test count explosion and naming overhead.
- Choose mock strictness mode (`NiceMock`, `StrictMock`, `NaggyMock`) to balance usability and feedback noise.

## Example: Using Sequences and Expectation Retirement to Optimize Mock Calls

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
using ::testing::Return;
using ::testing::RetiresOnSaturation;

class MockService {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(int, Calculate, (int a, int b), ());
};

TEST(ServiceTest, OrderedCallsWithRetirement) {
  MockService mock;
  {
    InSequence seq;

    EXPECT_CALL(mock, Calculate(1, 2))
        .WillOnce(Return(3))
        .RetiresOnSaturation();
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, Calculate(3, 4))
        .WillOnce(Return(7))
        .RetiresOnSaturation();
  }

  EXPECT_EQ(3, mock.Calculate(1, 2));
  EXPECT_EQ(7, mock.Calculate(3, 4));
}
```

This test sets two ordered expectations and ensures they are retired after use, reducing unnecessary matches and improving performance.

## Control Verbosity for Performance

For large tests, suppress verbose mock call info using:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=warning
```

or for least verbosity:

```bash
--gmock_verbose=error
```

Adjust verbosity dynamically to balance debug information and test runtime.
