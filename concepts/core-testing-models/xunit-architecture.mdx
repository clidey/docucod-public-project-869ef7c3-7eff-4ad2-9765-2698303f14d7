# xUnit Architecture & Test Structure

GoogleTest is built upon the popular xUnit testing architecture, designed to drive clear, maintainable, and reliable C++ tests. This page unpacks how GoogleTest implements core xUnit concepts — separating individual tests, test suites, and test fixtures — enabling modular test design and code reuse.

## Understanding the Core Components

### Test

A *test* in GoogleTest corresponds to a single executable unit verifying one particular behavior or case of your code. It contains assertions you write to check expected outcomes.

- **Definition:** Individual tests are defined using macros such as `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, which automate registration and execution.
- **Characteristics:** Each test is isolated with its own fresh fixture instance, ensuring independence and repeatability.
- **Naming:** Tests are uniquely identified within their *test suite* by name.

Example of a simple test:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

### Test Suite

A *test suite* groups logically related tests under one umbrella, typically corresponding to the class, component, or module under test. This grouping improves organization, reporting clarity, and resource sharing.

- **Composition:** Each test suite contains multiple tests.
- **Naming:** Test suites are named explicitly, commonly suffixed with `Test` (e.g., `MathTest`).
- **Scope:** Enables shared setup and teardown at the suite level.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) { ... }
TEST(MathTest, Subtraction) { ... }
```

Both tests belong to the `MathTest` suite.

### Test Fixture

A *test fixture* provides a reusable environment for tests within a test suite by grouping common setup and teardown code, and shared data.

- **Implementation:** Defined by inheriting from `testing::Test`. 
- **Lifecycle:** GoogleTest creates a new fixture object for each test, calls `SetUp()`, runs the test, then calls `TearDown()`.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Eliminates duplicate setup code.
  - Ensures tests are independent despite shared resources.
  - Supports expensive resource management via static methods for suite-level setup and teardown.

Example fixture:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    q_.Enqueue(1);
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup if necessary
  }

  Queue<int> q_;  // Shared resource
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q_.size(), 1);
}
```

## From Test Definition to Execution Flow

GoogleTest manages registration and execution of tests seamlessly:

1. **Definition:** Using the `TEST` or `TEST_F` macros, tests and fixtures are declared.
2. **Registration:** Each macro registers the test with internal GoogleTest structures before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
3. **Execution:** When `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called (typically in `main()`), GoogleTest iterates over all test suites and runs each test sequentially.
4. **Test Isolation:** For each test, a new test fixture instance is created and initialized via `SetUp()`. The test body runs next, followed by `TearDown()`. The fixture is then destroyed.
5. **Reporting:** Results are aggregated per test and test suite, accessible to listeners and reporters.

The fresh fixture instance per test maximizes isolation and avoids unintended test interactions.

## Advanced Test Suite Setup: Shared Resources

Expensive resources used across multiple tests should be set up once per suite, rather than per test, for efficiency.

- Define `static` members in your fixture for shared resources.
- Implement `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()` to setup/cleanup those static members.

Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    db_connection_ = new DBConnection("test-db");
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    delete db_connection_;
    db_connection_ = nullptr;
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Setup for each test
  }

  static DBConnection* db_connection_;
};

DBConnection* DatabaseTest::db_connection_ = nullptr;

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, QueryWorks) {
  auto result = db_connection_->Query("SELECT * FROM users");
  EXPECT_TRUE(result.IsValid());
}
```

Important considerations:

- The test order is undefined; tests cannot rely on sequence.
- Shared state must be constant or restored between tests to maintain isolation.

## Relationship Diagram

This diagram visualizes the relationships among the core xUnit components in GoogleTest:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class UnitTest {
        +GetInstance()
        +RunAllTests()
    }
    class TestSuite {
        +name()
        +GetTestInfo(index)
    }
    class TestInfo {
        +test_suite_name()
        +name()
        +result()
    }
    class TestResult {
        +Passed()
        +Failed()
    }
    class TestFixture {
        +SetUp()
        +TearDown()
    }
    UnitTest --> "*" TestSuite : contains
    TestSuite --> "*" TestInfo : contains
    TestInfo o-- TestResult : has
    TestInfo --> TestFixture : runs with
```

- The `UnitTest` singleton contains multiple `TestSuite` instances.
- Each `TestSuite` manages multiple `TestInfo` objects, representing individual tests.
- Each test is executed with its associated `TestFixture` class.
- Test results (`TestResult`) hold the outcome for each test.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Name test suites and tests clearly:** Use meaningful, consistent naming reflecting your code structure. Avoid underscores for better integration.
- **Use test fixtures wisely:** Encapsulate common setup/teardown in fixtures to avoid duplicated setup code.
- **Use static suite-level setup for expensive resources:** Implement `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to improve performance.
- **Keep tests isolated:** Avoid sharing mutable state; reset any changed state to prevent flaky tests.
- **Leverage inheritance:** Fixtures and tests can inherit to share or extend behavior.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting xUnit Test Structure Issues">
<Accordion title="Test Compilation Errors: 'virtual outside class declaration'">
This error typically occurs when `TEST_F` is used without first defining the corresponding test fixture class. Define the fixture by inheriting from `testing::Test` before using `TEST_F`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Discovered">
Ensure tests are registered before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and are not disabled (do not prefix test names or test suite names with `DISABLED_`). Check filter flags like `--gtest_filter` which may limit tests run.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Shared Resource Leaks in Tests">
If you use static resources in fixtures with `SetUpTestSuite()`, ensure they are freed in `TearDownTestSuite()`. Otherwise, resources may leak between test runs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Affecting Each Other">
Ensure that test fixtures do not share mutable state across tests, or reset state as needed. Each test runs in a fresh fixture instance; avoid static mutable data unless carefully managed.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
