# xUnit Principles and Test Fixtures

GoogleTest is built on the foundational xUnit architecture, embracing test cases, fixtures, assertions, and automatic test discovery to streamline robust C++ testing. This guide explains how GoogleTest extends xUnit principles to empower you to write clear, organized, and maintainable tests.

---

## Understanding Test Cases and Tests

At the core of xUnit is the concept of a **test case** (or *test suite*), a container that groups related tests. Each **test** within a test case is a standalone function that verifies a particular aspect of your code.

In GoogleTest terminology:

- A *test suite* groups related test functions.
- Each *test* checks a specific behavior or property.

This structure helps you organize your tests logically, reflecting the design and structure of the code under test.

### Defining Tests

Use the `TEST` macro to create an individual test:

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  // Your test assertions here
  EXPECT_EQ(ComputeValue(), expected_value);
}
```

- The first argument names the test suite.
- The second argument names the test.

Tests in the same suite share that suite’s name but are distinct tests.

**Important:** Both names must be valid C++ identifiers and should not contain underscores (`_`). This prevents naming conflicts and ensures consistent test behavior (see [Why test names should not contain underscores](../faq.md#why-should-test-suite-names-and-test-names-not-contain-underscore)).

---

## Test Fixtures: Reusing Setup and Teardown Code

Often, multiple tests need to work with similar data or objects. xUnit addresses this with **test fixtures**, which let tests share common setup and cleanup logic.

### What Is a Test Fixture?

A test fixture is a class that:

- Encapsulates the objects and resources that multiple tests operate on.
- Provides methods to set up (prepare) and tear down (clean up) the environment before and after each test.

### Writing and Using Fixtures

Define a fixture by subclassing `testing::Test` and placing shared data and setup/teardown logic inside:

```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Optional constructor setup
    q1_.Enqueue(1);
    q2_.Enqueue(2);
    q2_.Enqueue(3);
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Called immediately before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Called immediately after each test
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};
```

Use `TEST_F` to write tests using the fixture:

```cpp
TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueWorks) {
  int* n = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(n, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*n, 1);
  delete n;
}
```

Each test gets a new instance of the fixture class, ensuring test isolation.

### When to Use Constructor vs `SetUp()`

- Prefer using the fixture constructor to initialize constant or immutable members.
- Override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` for dynamic setup and cleanup that might fail or be more complex.

**Note:** Virtual functions don’t dispatch correctly within constructors or destructors, so initialization that relies on runtime polymorphism should go in `SetUp()`.

---

## Per-Test-Suite Setup and Teardown

GoogleTest supports setup and teardown **shared across all tests in a suite** via static methods:

- `SetUpTestSuite()` — called before the first test in the suite.
- `TearDownTestSuite()` — called after the last test in the suite.

Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Initialize DB connection shared by all tests
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Cleanup DB connection
  }

  void SetUp() override {
    // Prepare per-test data
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Per-test cleanup
  }
};
```

This allows expensive resources to be initialized once and shared, improving test performance.

**Important:** Because the order of test execution is undefined, tests must not depend on any order or side effects that affect others.

---

## Assertions: Verifying Expected Behavior

Tests verify expected behavior using **assertions**. GoogleTest provides a rich set of assertion macros that report failures when expectations are violated.

Examples:

- `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)` — checks for equality but continues after failure.
- `ASSERT_NE(ptr, nullptr)` — checks condition and aborts the current test on failure.

When possible, prefer non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) to allow detection of multiple errors per test.

### Custom Failure Messages

You can append custom messages:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(x, y) << "x and y should be equal";
```

### Using Assertions in Fixtures

Assertions live inside your tests or fixture methods, but cannot be used in constructors or destructors (see [GoogleTest FAQ](../faq.md#my-constructor-doesnt-call-setuptestreable)).

---

## Automatic Test Registration and Discovery

GoogleTest automatically discovers and registers tests defined with the macros `TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, and others.

This means:

- You do **not** need to manually register tests.
- Running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` executes all registered tests.
- Tests are isolated and independent.

This automation simplifies maintaining large test suites and running targeted tests.

---

## Summary of Test Execution Flow

1. Define tests using `TEST` or fixtures using `TEST_F`.
2. Write test logic, using assertions to verify correctness.
3. Optionally, implement fixture setup (`SetUp()`) and teardown (`TearDown()`) for reused preparation/cleanup.
4. Call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` in `main()` to initialize the framework.
5. Invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to execute all tests.
6. GoogleTest reports test results, including failures with file/line information.

---

## Best Practices

- Name your test suites and tests clearly, avoiding underscores.
- Use fixtures to eliminate duplication and centralize test setup.
- Keep tests independent to avoid side effects between runs.
- Prefer non-fatal assertions unless failure makes continuing meaningless.
- Structure tests to verify a single behavior for clear diagnostics.

## Example: Fixture and Tests in Action

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple Queue class for demo
template <typename T>
class Queue {
 public:
  void Enqueue(const T& elem) { data_.push_back(elem); }
  T* Dequeue() {
    if (data_.empty()) return nullptr;
    T* result = new T(data_.front());
    data_.pop_front();
    return result;
  }
  size_t size() const { return data_.size(); }

 private:
  std::deque<T> data_;
};

class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() {
    // Initial setup for queues
    q1_.Enqueue(100);
    q2_.Enqueue(10);
    q2_.Enqueue(20);
  }

  Queue<int> q0_;
  Queue<int> q1_;
  Queue<int> q2_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_EQ(q0_.size(), 0);
}

TEST_F(QueueTest, DequeueReturnsCorrectElements) {
  int* val = q1_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 100);
  delete val;

  val = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 10);
  delete val;

  val = q2_.Dequeue();
  ASSERT_NE(val, nullptr);
  EXPECT_EQ(*val, 20);
  delete val;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This example demonstrates an isolated, reusable setup via a fixture and multiple explicit tests verifying behavior.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Test fixture missing default constructor**: Ensure your fixture class can be default constructed unless you provide factory methods.
- **Assertions in constructors/destructors**: Do setup/teardown work in `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`, not constructors.
- **Test names with underscores causing failures**: Follow naming rules to avoid ambiguous generated names.
- **Shared resource state leaks between tests**: Use per-test setup and teardown or per-suite setup carefully.

---

## Further Learning

GoogleTest offers powerful extensions:

- **Value-Parameterized and Typed Tests**: Run the same test logic over multiple input values or types.
- **Death Tests**: Verify your code crashes correctly in error conditions.
- **Mocking Integration**: Use GoogleMock to define and verify mocks with expectation setting.

Explore these topics to raise your test suite quality and coverage.
