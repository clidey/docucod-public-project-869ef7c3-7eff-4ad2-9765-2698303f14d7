# Test Structure & Discovery

GoogleTest leverages a well-defined xUnit architecture to organize and discover tests seamlessly, enabling automated discovery and execution flows in your C++ test programs. This page explains the core concepts behind how GoogleTest structures tests using test suites, fixtures, and its macro system, and outlines how these elements collaborate to register and initialize tests efficiently.

## Understanding Test Organization in GoogleTest

At its core, GoogleTest organizes tests into hierarchical collections that simplify managing and running tests, making it straightforward to write scalable, maintainable test programs.

### Key Terminology

- **Test Suite**: A logical grouping of related tests. Each test suite corresponds typically to the test fixture class used or a grouping via explicit macros.
- **Test Fixture**: A C++ class derived from `testing::Test` that provides shared setup and teardown for multiple related tests within a suite.
- **Test**: An individual test case (method) that runs a specific validation scenario.

### Tests are Registered Using Specialized Macros

GoogleTest provides a set of macros to declare and organize tests:

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`: Declares a simple test without shared fixture data.
- `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`: Declares a test using a fixture class, enabling reuse of setup and data.
- `TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`: Declares a value-parameterized test that runs multiple times with different input parameters.
- `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` and `TYPED_TEST`: Allow defining typed tests that run the same test logic across a list of types.

Each of these macros leads GoogleTest to register the test internally, associating it with metadata such as location, parameters, and fixture classes.

### How Tests Are Discovered

When your test binary is launched, GoogleTest automatically discovers all registered tests prior to execution. This process includes:

1. **Registration**: The macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()` invoke internal code that registers tests with GoogleTest’s test registry before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is invoked.

2. **Grouping**: Tests registered with the same first argument (e.g., `TestSuiteName`) are grouped into a common test suite.

3. **Initialization**: Before any individual test runs, GoogleTest runs suite-level setup via `SetUpTestSuite()` (if provided in the fixture), and then for each test, performs test-instance setup with `SetUp()`.

4. **Test Execution and Teardown**: Each test executes its body, followed by `TearDown()`. After all tests in a suite run, `TearDownTestSuite()` is called.

## Organizing Tests Using Suites and Fixtures

### Test Suites

Test suites provide a container for logically related tests and often correspond to a particular class or module under test. They enable running sets of tests together and reporting results aggregated by suite.

### Test Fixtures

Fixtures are classes derived from `testing::Test` that:
- Define shared member variables or resources for tests.
- Provide `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` hooks that run before and after every individual test in the suite, ensuring each test starts from a clean state.
- May optionally implement `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` static methods to allocate shared resources once per suite rather than per test.

For example:

```cpp
class MyFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Code here runs before each test
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Code here runs after each test
  }

  static void SetUpTestSuite() {
    // Code here runs once before the first test in this suite
  }

  static void TearDownTestSuite() {
    // Code here runs once after the last test in this suite
  }

  // Shared test objects go here
  MyClass shared_resource_;
};

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestCase1) {
  // Test code that can use shared_resource_
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, TestCase2) {
  // Another test using the same fixture
}
```

### Value-Parameterized Tests

These allow running a single test template many times with different input values. Use `TEST_P()` to declare parameterized tests and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` to supply test parameters.

Example:

```cpp
class MyParamTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyParamTest, CheckParam) {
  int param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_GT(param, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(PositiveParams, MyParamTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

This instantiates tests with parameters `1`, `2`, and `3`, creating separate test instances for each.

---

## Test Registration and Macros

GoogleTest’s macros hide the complexities of constructing and registering tests.

### How `TEST()` Works

The macro expands into code that:
- Defines a test fixture class (usually a subclass of `testing::Test`)
- Implements the `TestBody()` method containing your test statements
- Registers the test to the testing framework so that it is discoverable

Tests in different suites with identical test names are allowed; their fully qualified names include the suite name.

### `TEST_F()`

This macro uses a user-defined fixture class for shared setup.

### `TEST_P()` and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()`

These macros define and instantiate parameterized tests. `TEST_P()` defines the test template, and `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` binds parameter sets to this template, generating concrete test cases.

### Typed Tests

Typed tests extend the concept to run the same test logic across many types. They use `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()`, `TYPED_TEST()`, and related macros.

## Lifecycle and Initialization of Test Suites

GoogleTest runs tests in the following order for each suite:

1. `SetUpTestSuite()` static method — Executed once before any tests in the suite run.
2. For each test:
   - Construct a fresh test fixture object.
   - Call `SetUp()` on the fixture.
   - Run the `TestBody()` for the test.
   - Call `TearDown()` on the fixture.
   - Destroy the fixture object.
3. `TearDownTestSuite()` static method — Executed once after all tests in the suite have executed.

This workflow ensures isolation between tests and maximizes reliability and repeatability.

## Test Discovery Friendly Features

GoogleTest’s structure supports advanced test discovery with tools and IDEs:

- **Automatic test enumeration**: Test macros register tests automatically, so users don’t maintain test lists manually.
- **Support for filtering**: Users can filter tests by suite and name at run-time using `--gtest_filter` flag.
- **Unique Naming**: Tests have unique fully qualified names based on suite and test names.
- **Parameterized test discovery**: Parameterized test instances are listed separately with generated names indicating the parameter values.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Avoid underscores (`_`) in test suite and test names to prevent naming conflicts and ensure stable compilation and registration behavior.
- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) when multiple tests share common data or setup to reduce code duplication.
- Leverage parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) to efficiently test multiple inputs with the same logic.
- Initialize expensive shared resources in `SetUpTestSuite()` rather than `SetUp()` to improve test performance.
- Always remember GoogleTest creates a new fixture instance per test — don’t rely on state retention across tests.

---

## Troubleshooting Test Registration

- If you receive errors about missing default constructors in fixture classes, provide a public default constructor.
- Mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` within the same suite causes runtime errors; use `TEST_F()` consistently in such cases.
- Parameterized tests defined via `TEST_P()` without matching instantiations via `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P()` cause verification failures; suppress with `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` if intentional.
