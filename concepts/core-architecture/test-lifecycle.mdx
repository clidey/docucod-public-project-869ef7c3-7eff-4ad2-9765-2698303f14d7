# Test Discovery and Execution Lifecycle

Understanding how GoogleTest manages the journey from writing a test to executing it and reporting the results is fundamental to mastering the framework. This lifecycle encompasses test registration macros, automated test discovery, the ordering and execution of tests, and the hooks for setup and teardown at various stages. Furthermore, it places this process in the context of both unit testing and broader integration scenarios.

---

## 1. Writing Tests and Test Registration

The GoogleTest framework offers versatile macros to define your tests, automatically registering them for discovery, execution, and reporting without requiring manual enumeration.

### 1.1 Basic Test Macros

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`: Defines a simple test.
- `TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`: Defines a test using a test fixture for shared setup/teardown.
- `TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`: Defines a value-parameterized test.

Once declared, these macros automatically register the tests with GoogleTest, associating the test code with metadata such as suite name, test name, source file, and line number.

### 1.2 How Registration Works

When a test macro is used, it creates a `TestInfo` object that encapsulates:

- The test suite and test names
- Fixture class information
- Source file location
- Factory method for creating test instances

This `TestInfo` is added to the global registry managed by a singleton `UnitTest` instance, enabling automatic discovery during test runs.

### 1.3 RegisterTest API

For dynamic or advanced use cases where tests need to be registered at runtime, GoogleTest provides:

```cpp
template <typename Factory>
TestInfo* RegisterTest(const char* test_suite_name, const char* test_name,
                      const char* type_param, const char* value_param,
                      const char* file, int line, Factory factory);
```

The factory creates instances of test classes and ensures consistent fixture use. This function must be called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

---

## 2. Test Discovery and Filtering

GoogleTest automatically discovers all registered tests before running. Importantly, it offers powerful filtering and ordering options to select which tests to execute.

### 2.1 Filtering Tests

- Tests are identified by the combination of test suite and test name, joined as `TestSuiteName.TestName`.
- The `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable lets you specify positive and negative glob patterns to include or exclude tests.

Example filters:

- `FooTest.*` runs all tests in `FooTest` suite.
- `*Null*:*Constructor*` runs tests containing either “Null” or “Constructor”.
- `FooTest.*-FooTest.Bar` runs all tests in `FooTest` except `Bar`.

### 2.2 Disabled Tests

Prefixing test suite or test names with `DISABLED_` excludes them from runs by default.
Running disabled tests is possible via the `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag.

### 2.3 Test Sharding

GoogleTest supports test sharding to distribute tests across multiple machines or processes using environment variables:

- `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`: Total number of shards.
- `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`: The index of the current shard.

Tests are partitioned deterministically to ensure each shard runs a unique subset.

---

## 3. Test Ordering and Execution

GoogleTest guarantees that tests are ordered and executed consistently, with configuration to shuffle test order and stop on first failure.

### 3.1 Deterministic Ordering

By default, tests are ordered lexicographically by source file and line number to correspond with the order of definitions in your source code. This predictability aids debugging and reproducibility.

### 3.2 Shuffling Tests

To detect inter-test dependencies, use the `--gtest_shuffle` flag which randomizes the test execution order each iteration, employing a seed reported on the console to reproduce failures.

### 3.3 Fail Fast

Enabled by `--gtest_fail_fast`, this option immediately stops test execution upon the first failure, facilitating quicker debugging cycles.

### 3.4 Test Lifecycle

For each test selected to run:

1. A new fixture object is instantiated.
2. `SetUpTestSuite()` is called once before the first test in a test suite (if defined).
3. `SetUp()` runs before each test.
4. The test body executes.
5. `TearDown()` runs after each test.
6. `TearDownTestSuite()` is called once after the last test in the test suite (if defined).
7. The fixture object is destroyed.

Tests are isolated: modifications in one test do not impact others.

## 4. Lifecycle Hooks: Setup and Teardown

GoogleTest provides multiple hooks to prepare and clean test state efficiently.

### 4.1 Per-Test Setup and Teardown

- Override `void SetUp()` and `void TearDown()` in your fixture class.
- These run before and after every individual test.

### 4.2 Per-Test-Suite Setup and Teardown

- Define static methods `static void SetUpTestSuite()` and `static void TearDownTestSuite()`.
- Called once before and after the entire test suite's tests run.
- Ideal for managing shared resources to avoid expensive setup/teardown per test.

### 4.3 Global Environment Setup and Teardown

- Implement subclasses of `::testing::Environment` and override `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`.
- Register with `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` before tests run.
- These hooks run once for the whole test program.

### 4.4 Skipping Tests

Use `GTEST_SKIP()` in any setup or test phase to skip execution and record the skip status.

---

## 5. Test Reporting and Results

GoogleTest tracks detailed result information for each test and test suite.

### 5.1 Test and Suite Results

- Each `TestInfo` stores a `TestResult`:
  - List of assertion results (`TestPartResult`)
  - Test properties for additional user data
  - Timing
- The `TestSuite` has an ad hoc `TestResult` for failures in suite-level setup/teardown.

### 5.2 Outcome States

Tests can pass, fail (fatal and nonfatal failures), or be skipped.

### 5.3 Result Reporting

- `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` returns `0` if all tests pass.
- Detailed console output includes test start/end, pass/fail statuses, and timing.
- Optionally, XML or JSON reports can be generated with the `--gtest_output` flag.

### 5.4 Event Listeners

GoogleTest fires events throughout the lifecycle:

- Program start/end
- Test iteration start/end
- Environment setup/teardown
- Test suite start/end
- Test start/end
- Part result (assertions)

Users can implement `TestEventListener` to hook into these and create custom logging, reporting, or integrations.

## 6. Context in Unit and Integration Testing

While GoogleTest is most known as a unit testing framework, its lifecycle and management infrastructure equally supports larger scale integration testing.

- Tests can be organized from granular unit tests up to complex integration suites.
- Use fixtures and global environments to manage resource lifetimes appropriately across scales.
- Test sharding and repeat options help scale test execution in CI environments.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use `TEST_F` when shared setup/teardown is needed; otherwise, use `TEST`.
- Prefer `EXPECT_*` to allow tests to continue collecting errors.
- Use per-test-suite `SetUpTestSuite`/`TearDownTestSuite` for expensive resources.
- Avoid dependencies on test execution order; use shuffling to detect them.
- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to gracefully skip in setup or tests.
- Take advantage of filtering to run focused subsets during development.
- Register global environments sparingly and carefully to manage program-wide setup.
- Leverage event listeners for custom logging, integration with CI, or test metrics.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Tests not running:
  - Check filtering patterns.
  - Verify test names and test suites.
  - Disabled tests won't run unless opted in.
- Setup/teardown not behaving as expected:
  - Ensure `SetUp` / `TearDown` spelled correctly.
  - Confirm `SetUpTestSuite` / `TearDownTestSuite` are `static`.
- Premature test exits:
  - Use the premature exit file feature to diagnose unexpected termination.
- Sharding issues:
  - Verify shard index and total shards environment variables.
