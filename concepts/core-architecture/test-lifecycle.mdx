# Test Lifecycle and Execution Model

Discover the end-to-end lifecycle of a test in GoogleTest, from discovery and initialization, through execution and assertion, to reporting results. Explore how main entry points, fixtures, and setups work together, and how GoogleMock integrates into the lifecycle to enable controlled behavior.

---

## Introduction

Understanding how GoogleTest processes tests internally is essential for writing effective, maintainable, and debuggable test suites. GoogleTest follows a structured test lifecycle that ensures tests are isolated, repeatable, and provide detailed failure diagnostics.

This page walks you through the full lifecycle of a test run, including discovery, setup, execution, failure handling, and teardown. You'll also see how GoogleMock integrates to control mock object behavior within this lifecycle.

---

## 1. Test Discovery and Registration

### Defining Tests

- **Macro-Based Registration:** Tests are typically declared using macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()`. Each macro expands into a class and registers the test with GoogleTest's internal registry.This registration associates the test's *fixture class* (if any), name, source code location, and factory function to create test instances.

- **Dynamic Registration:** For more complex scenarios, `RegisterTest()` allows programmatic registration of tests at runtime, facilitating dynamic test generation.

### Types of Tests

- **Simple Tests (`TEST`)**: Standalone tests without fixtures.
- **Fixture Tests (`TEST_F`)**: Tests that share a common test fixture class instance.
- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`) and Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)**: Tests instantiated multiple times with various parameters or types.

### Test Suites

- Tests are grouped into *test suites* (formerly called *test cases*), which are collections of logically related tests sharing names and fixtures.

---

## 2. Test Initialization

### GoogleTest Initialization

- The entry point for test programs is typically `main()`, calling `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` to parse command-line flags and initialize internal data structures.

- Flags control behaviors like test filtering, running disabled tests, output formats, repeat counts, sharding, and more.

### Global Test Environments

- Users can define global environments by subclassing `testing::Environment` with `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods for global setup and teardown.

- Environments are registered with `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` and are invoked in the order they are registered before tests run, and torn down in reverse order after tests finish.

- Global environments run only if at least one test will be executed. They can report failures, and their teardown runs even if tests fail.

---

## 3. Test Suite Setup and Teardown

### Test Suite Lifecycle

- Before any test in a test suite runs, GoogleTest calls the suite-level setup method `SetUpTestSuite()` if defined.
- After the last test in the suite finishes, GoogleTest calls `TearDownTestSuite()`.

### Shared Resources

- The test suite lifecycle allows expensive resources to be set up once and shared across all tests within that suite, improving test performance.

- Because tests are run on fresh fixture instances, the shared resources need to be static members of the fixture class.

---

## 4. Test Execution Flow

### Per-Test Lifecycle

Each individual test follows this precise flow:

1. **Test Fixture Construction:** An instance of the test fixture class is created (if using a fixture).
2. **`SetUp()` Method Execution:** Initializes test-specific state before running the test body.
3. **Test Body (`TestBody()`) Execution:** The core test code, where assertions (`EXPECT_*` or `ASSERT_*`) are made.
4. **`TearDown()` Method Execution:** Cleans up any test-specific resources.
5. **Fixture Destruction:** The test fixture instance is destroyed to prepare for the next test.


### Assertion Behavior

- **Fatal Assertions (`ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`)** abort the current function immediately but do not abort the whole test program, allowing GoogleTest to continue running other tests.

- **Nonfatal Assertions (`EXPECT_*`, `ADD_FAILURE()`)** record the failure but allow the current function and test to continue.

- Users can check for failures in the current test via `HasFatalFailure()`, `HasNonfatalFailure()`, or `HasFailure()`.

### Skipping Tests

- Calling `GTEST_SKIP()` in tests or fixtures stops test execution and marks the test or test suite as skipped.

### Using `SCOPED_TRACE`

- `SCOPED_TRACE` adds contextual trace messages to failure outputs, helping identify from which scope or iteration failures arise, especially useful in helper functions or loops.

---

## 5. Handling Test Failures

### Failure Types

- **Fatal Failure:** Stops the current function; indicated by `ASSERT_*` macros or `FAIL()`.
- **Nonfatal Failure:** Marks failure but continues execution; produced by `EXPECT_*` macros or `ADD_FAILURE()`.

### Failure Reporting

- Failures cause GoogleTest to record source location, failure messages, and stack traces.

- Multiple failures within the same test are all reported, offering comprehensive diagnostic information.

- Failures in helper functions or nested calls propagate only if checked explicitly (e.g., with `HasFatalFailure()`).

---

## 6. Test Reporting and Result Aggregation

### Test Info and Results

- GoogleTest maintains `TestInfo` and `TestResult` objects that store metadata and results for individual tests.

- `TestSuite` aggregates test results and durations.

- `UnitTest` singleton provides overall program-level aggregates and statistics.

### Output and Event Listeners

- GoogleTest provides default output listeners for console and XML/JSON outputs.

- Users can add custom event listeners by subclassing `TestEventListener` or `EmptyTestEventListener` to hook into the test lifecycle events such as `OnTestStart()`, `OnTestEnd()`, `OnTestPartResult()`, etc.

- Event listeners receive notifications of test program start/end, iteration start/end, environment setup/teardown, test suite start/end, and individual test start/end.

### Repeat and Shuffle

- The framework supports repeating tests multiple times (`--gtest_repeat`) and shuffling test order (`--gtest_shuffle`) to detect flaky tests and order dependencies.

### Test Filtering and Sharding

- Users can run subsets of tests using filters (`--gtest_filter`) and distribute tests across machines using sharding environment variables.

---

## 7. Special Test Types and Integration

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

- Parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) run the same test body with different parameter values.

- Typed tests (`TYPED_TEST`) run the same code over a list of types.

- Both types leverage the cycle of registration, instantiation, and execution outlined earlier.

### Death Tests

- Death tests verify that code under test appropriately terminates or crashes when expected.

- These tests run in separate processes and observe the termination status and output.

- They may require special care in multithreaded environments.

### Mocking with GoogleMock

- GoogleMock integrates with GoogleTest's lifecycle by creating mock objects during test setup and allowing users to set expectations and behaviors that influence test assertions.

- Mock expectations are verified at the end of each test.

- The interaction with the test lifecycle ensures mocks are isolated per test and any unexpected calls or violations cause test failures.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Fatal failures in helper functions:** Remember that `ASSERT_*` aborts only the current function. Use `HasFatalFailure()` or exception based mechanisms to propagate fatal conditions properly.

- **Interleaved logging and assertion output:** Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add context when failures happen in deeply nested or repetitive code.

- **Global environment failure:** Fatal failures in global environment setup prevent any tests from running. Use careful setup and error handling in your environments.

- **Uninstantiated parameterized tests:** GoogleTest will report an error if you define parameterized tests without corresponding instantiations. Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` if this is intentional.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Structure tests with fixtures (`TEST_F`) to share setup/teardown code.
- Use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive global test suite state.
- Keep tests independent by resetting state between tests.
- Use nonfatal assertions (`EXPECT_*`) when multiple failures per test are helpful.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` liberally in complex scenarios to improve failure messages.
- Utilize event listeners to customize reporting, logging, or integrate with other tools.
- For mocks, define expectations explicitly and verify behaviors at test end.
- Use repeat and shuffle flags during CI runs to detect flaky tests.
