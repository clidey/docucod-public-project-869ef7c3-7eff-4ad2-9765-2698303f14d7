# Test Lifecycle & Execution Model

GoogleTest guides your tests along a clearly defined lifecycle, starting from their definition in code, moving through their discovery and registration, running the tests in a controlled order, and finally aggregating and reporting their results. This model ensures your tests run independently, reliably, and with rich feedback.

---

## 1. Defining Tests and Test Suites

The journey begins when you write your tests using the `TEST`, `TEST_F`, or `TEST_P` macros:

- **`TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`**: Defines an individual test named `TestName` under a test suite `TestSuiteName`. The suite groups logically related tests.

- **`TEST_F(TestFixtureName, TestName)`**: Defines an individual test that uses a test fixture `TestFixtureName`. The test fixture sets up a shared context for tests in a suite.

- **`TEST_P(TestFixtureName, TestName)`**: Defines a value-parameterized test using the test fixture `TestFixtureName`. This enables running the same test logic with various input parameters.

All these macros register your tests automatically with GoogleTest upon program startup, eliminating any need to enumerate them manually.

### Important Naming Rules

- Test suite and test names must be valid C++ identifiers and **cannot contain underscores (`_`)** due to name mangling rules in GoogleTest.
- Parameterized tests require separate instantiation via `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to generate runnable tests.

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}

// Using test fixtures:
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Setup common resources
  }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, EnqueueWorks) {
  ...
}

// Parameterized test definition:
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, WorksForVariousInputs) {
  int param = GetParam();
  ...
}

// Parameterized test instantiation:
INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(MyParams, FooTest, testing::Values(1, 2, 3));
```

---

## 2. Test Registration and Discovery

Tests you define are registered with GoogleTest during static initialization, involving the following:

- Each test corresponds to a `TestInfo` object holding metadata (name, source file, parameters).
- Tests are grouped into `TestSuite` objects representing collections of related tests.
- Parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) require an explicit instantiation step (`INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) which produces concrete test cases based on parameters.

GoogleTest maintains a global registry of all `TestSuite`s and their `TestInfo`s inside the singleton `UnitTest` instance.

This registry enables GoogleTest to:

- Perform automatic discovery of all tests linked into your binary.
- Apply user-specified filters to select tests to run.
- Manage test sharding by grouping tests appropriately.

---

## 3. Execution Order and Lifecycle

Once you call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest orchestrates the test execution through several phases:

### Initialization

1. **Setup Global Test Environments:** Registered global environments (`testing::Environment` subclasses) each have their `SetUp()` called once before any test runs.
2. **Test Suite Setup:** Before running tests in a suite, GoogleTest calls the static `SetUpTestSuite()` for the suite’s fixture.

### Running Tests

3. For each test in a suite, GoogleTest runs the following sequence with a fresh fixture object:
   - Construct test fixture (calls constructor).
   - Calls test fixture's `SetUp()`.
   - Calls the test body.
   - Calls test fixture's `TearDown()`.
   - Destructs the test fixture.

4. If a test causes a fatal failure in `SetUp()` or the test body, the remainder of the fixture lifecycle or test set is skipped as appropriate.

5. Upon completion of all tests in a suite, GoogleTest calls `TearDownTestSuite()` static method for fixture cleanup.

6. After all tests across suites run, it calls `TearDown()` for global test environments.

### Execution Ordering Guarantees

- Test suites are run in the order of registration but death-test suites (names ending with "DeathTest") always run first.
- Tests within suites run in source code order determined by file and line number, stabilized by sorting. User can override order via `--gtest_shuffle` flag.
- If `--gtest_fail_fast` is enabled, execution stops immediately on the first test failure.

---

## 4. Filtering and Sharding of Tests

### Filtering Tests

GoogleTest supports a powerful filtering mechanism via the `--gtest_filter` flag:

- Filters are `:`-separated lists of positive patterns optionally followed by `-` and negative patterns.
- Patterns support wildcards `*` and `?`, matching full test names "TestSuite.TestName".

Example:

```bash
./my_test --gtest_filter=FooTest.*-FooTest.FlakyTest
```

Will run all tests in `FooTest` except the `FlakyTest`.

### Test Sharding

For large test suites, tests can be distributed across multiple shards (machines or processes) using:

- Environment variables: `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`.
- Each shard runs a subset of tests determined by modulo of a test’s unique id.

GoogleTest guarantees each test runs exactly once across all shards. Sharding is transparent to the user.

---

## 5. Result Aggregation and Reporting

After test execution, GoogleTest collects and aggregates results:

- Each `TestInfo` object stores results for an individual test.
- Each `TestSuite` aggregates results across its tests and records its own status.
- The `UnitTest` singleton aggregates results across all suites.

Key statistics and outcomes you can query:

- Count of passed, failed, skipped, disabled, and total tests and suites.
- Elapsed time for tests, suites, and the entire testing session.
- Detailed failure messages and stack traces.

### Recording Additional Test Properties

You can record additional key/value properties during tests or fixtures using:

```cpp
RecordProperty("PropertyName", "value");
```

These are included in XML or JSON reports, useful for custom metadata or diagnostics.

### Output Formats

GoogleTest can generate:

- Human-readable colored text reports on console.
- Detailed XML reports compliant with JUnit format via `--gtest_output=xml`.
- JSON reports via `--gtest_output=json`.

These reports capture hierarchical test information, failure details, timings, and allow integration with CI systems.

## 6. Test Events and Listeners

The entire test lifecycle emits events that you can listen to by implementing
`TestEventListener`. You get notifications on:

- Test program start/end
- Test iteration start/end (for repeated runs)
- Global environment setup/teardown
- Test suite start/end
- Test start/end
- Individual test assertion results (`OnTestPartResult`)

GoogleTest supplies default listeners for console printing and XML generation, but you can customize or augment these by adding your own listeners.

---

## Key Tips & Best Practices

- **Always name test suites and tests with alphanumeric characters, avoiding underscores**.
- Use **fresh test fixtures for each test** to ensure isolation.
- Define and use **`SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for expensive shared resources**.
- Leverage **parameterization (`TEST_P`)** for scalable, data-driven testing.
- Use **`RecordProperty()` to add extra context to your test reports**.
- **Call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`** for proper initialization.
- Use **`SCOPED_TRACE()` to improve failure diagnosis in nested function calls**.
- On test failure, verify the test runner respects the exit code from `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

<Check>
Remember: Always call `InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv)` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to initialize and configure your test executable.
</Check>

<Warning>
Mixing different test fixtures within the same test suite is illegal — all tests in a suite must use the same fixture type.
</Warning>

<Info>
Parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) must be paired with instantiations (`INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`) or will generate failing tests alerting you to the omission.
</Info>

<Note>
When your tests include death tests, name your suites with a `DeathTest` suffix to ensure correct execution order.
</Note>
