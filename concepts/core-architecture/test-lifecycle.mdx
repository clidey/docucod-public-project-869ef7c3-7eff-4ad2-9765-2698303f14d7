# Test Registration and Execution Lifecycle

Explore the journey of a test within GoogleTest—from the moment it's defined in code to its execution and reporting. This guide illuminates how tests are registered, discovered, scheduled, executed, and how results and events flow through the framework. It also covers lifecycle hooks and the handling of test data, offering practical insight into the inner workings from a user-centric perspective.

## 1. Test Registration: From Code to Framework Catalog

When you write a test using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, or programmatic registration APIs, GoogleTest automatically registers your test. Here's what happens:

- **Macro Expansion**: Each test macro expands into code that creates a `TestInfo` object.
- **TestInfo Construction**: On construction, `TestInfo` holds metadata such as test suite name, test name, source location, and a factory for creating the test instance.
- **Registration with UnitTest**: The `TestInfo` instance registers itself with the global singleton `UnitTest`, which maintains a comprehensive catalog of all registered tests.

This seamless registration means you don’t have to maintain any manual listing or registry of your tests—the framework handles it for you behind the scenes.

## 2. Test Discovery and Filtering

Before execution, GoogleTest applies your filtering rules to determine which tests to run:

- **Filtering by Name**: Using the `--gtest_filter` flag or `GTEST_FILTER` environment variable, you can include or exclude tests based on glob patterns matching the full test name (`TestSuite.TestName`).
- **Disabled Tests Management**: Tests prefixed with `DISABLED_` are ignored by default but can be included with the `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag.
- **Sharding Support**: With environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`, tests can be divided across machines or processes, each running only their assigned shard subset.

Filtering is performed in a thread-safe manner, and GoogleTest records which tests should execute accordingly.

## 3. Test Execution Scheduling

GoogleTest schedules tests primarily by their containing test suites:

- **Order of Execution**: Test suites are run in a deterministic, lexicographical order by default, or randomly if shuffling is enabled.
- **Death Test Suites First**: Suites whose names end with `DeathTest` are run before other tests to handle subprocess death testing requirements safely.
- **Test-Level Shuffle**: Individual tests within suites can be shuffled independently to detect inter-test dependencies.

If the `--gtest_fail_fast` flag is set, GoogleTest will halt further test runs upon the first failure encountered.

## 4. Test Lifecycle Hooks

GoogleTest provides hooks at several layers for you to prepare and clean up resources:

- **Global Environment Setup/TearDown**: Implemented by subclassing `testing::Environment`; setup runs before any tests, teardown runs after all tests.

- **Test Suite Setup/TearDown**: Use static methods `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` in your fixture class for expensive shared per-suite resource management.

- **Per-Test Setup/TearDown**: Override instance methods `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` in your test fixture to initialize and clean up for each individual test run.

- **Test Body Execution**: The `TestBody()` method in your fixture contains the actual test code invoked during test runs.

## 5. Execution Flow of a Single Test

The execution flow of a single test follows these steps:

1. **Test Object Creation**: Created via the factory provided by `TestInfo`.
2. **SetUp() Call**: Initializes the test fixture object.
3. **TestBody() Call**: Runs the actual test logic.
4. **TearDown() Call**: Cleans up after test logic.
5. **Destruction**: The test fixture object is deleted.

If a fatal failure (`ASSERT_*` macros or `FAIL()`) occurs in `SetUp()`, `TestBody()`, or `TearDown()`, execution aborts immediately at that step for the current test.

## 6. Collecting and Reporting Test Results

- **TestResult Object**: Each test has a `TestResult` that captures outcomes of all its assertions and steps, their statuses (passed, failed, skipped), test properties, death test counts, and elapsed time.

- **TestPartResults**: Each assertion emits a `TestPartResult` capturing the success or failure along with file location, error messages, and stack traces.

- **Event Notification**: GoogleTest notifies all registered event listeners about test progress, failures, and completions. You can plug in custom listeners to modify reporting or integrate with other tools.

- **Output Formats**: Results can be output in human-readable console text, as well as XML or JSON reports suited for CI pipelines and test result consumption.

## 7. Event Listener Notifications

GoogleTest's event-driven design emits notifications during these key points:

- **Test Program Start/End**
- **Test Iteration Start/End (when tests are repeated)**
- **Environment Setup/TearDown Start/End**
- **Test Suite Start/End**
- **Test Start/End**
- **Test Part Result (after each assertion or success/failure)**

These hooks enable integration, reporting customization, and resource monitoring.

## 8. Skipping Tests at Runtime

You can skip tests dynamically during execution using the `GTEST_SKIP()` macro. Common use cases include:

- Skipping tests that cannot run due to unmet runtime preconditions.
- Conditionally disabling tests at setup or within tests.

Skipped tests do not count as passed or failed.

## 9. Programmatic Test Registration

For advanced scenarios where tests must be registered dynamically (e.g., parameterized tests driven by runtime data), the API `testing::RegisterTest()` is provided. It accepts:

- Test suite and test names
- Source file and line for location reporting
- A factory callable to create test instances

Programmatic registration occurs before tests are run and is subject to the same filtering and execution rules.

## 10. Support for Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest expands parameterized test macros (`TEST_P`, `TYPED_TEST`, etc.) into individual test instances during initialization, including linking them with their parameter values.

- **Value-Parameterzed Tests**: Allow multiple instances with different data parameters.
- **Typed and Type-Parameterized Tests**: Allow running the same test logic against multiple types.

Each instantiated test appears as a separate `TestInfo` with its own metadata and execution.

## 11. Key User Outcomes

By understanding this lifecycle, users gain the ability to:

- Structure tests efficiently using fixtures and parameterization.
- Leverage filtering and sharding to run desired subsets quickly.
- Customize resource setup and teardown points effectively.
- Capture detailed test results with rich diagnostics.
- Integrate test event processing into CI/CD systems seamlessly.

## 13. Troubleshooting Tips

- **Test Not Running**: Ensure the test name matches the filter and it's not disabled unless `also_run_disabled_tests` is set.
- **Setup/TearDown Not Called**: Verify that you override the correctly spelled `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`, not `Setup()`.
- **Tests Overlapping Names**: Avoid underscores in test and suite names to prevent macro-generated class name collisions.
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: Use `--gtest_fail_fast` to stop after first failure during iterative development.
- **Skips and Conditional Execution**: Use `GTEST_SKIP()` in setup or tests to conditionally skip tests.
