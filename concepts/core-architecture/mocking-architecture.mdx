# Mocking Framework Design

Understanding how GoogleMock (gMock) works under the hood gives users crucial insights into how mock objects, expectations, and assertions are managed to deliver reliable and efficient test validations in C++. This guide dives into the architecture of gMock, illustrating its core components, flow of mock specification, behavior verification, and integration with GoogleTest.

---

## Introduction to GoogleMock's Architecture

At its core, GoogleMock is designed to help developers create mock objects effortlessly, specify expected behaviors, and verify these expectations automatically during test execution. It seamlessly integrates with the GoogleTest framework to provide a unified experience.

The key architectural goals of gMock are:

- Allow mocking of arbitrary C++ functions, including overloaded and templated methods.
- Support flexible specification of default actions (`ON_CALL`) and explicit expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`).
- Handle ordering constraints using sequences and prerequisites.
- Manage strictness levels of mocks (NiceMock, NaggyMock, StrictMock).
- Ensure thread-safe interaction and atomic execution of mock functions.
- Deliver detailed failure diagnostics with rich context.

---

## Core Components and Their Roles

### 1. Mock Classes and Mock Methods

GoogleMock leverages C++ templates and macros to generate mock classes from user interfaces. Each mock class contains _mock methods_ that replace real implementations during testing. These methods are created using the `MOCK_METHOD` macros that generate all necessary plumbing to intercept calls, check arguments, and delegate to specified actions.

### 2. FunctionMocker

Each mocked method internally uses a `FunctionMocker` instance templated by the function signature. This handles:
- Registering expectations and default actions.
- Matching calls against expectations.
- Selecting and invoking the appropriate actions.
- Reporting uninteresting or excessive calls.

### 3. Expectation Objects

Expectations represent individual mock call specifications created using `EXPECT_CALL`. They:
- Store argument matchers and action sequences (`WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`).
- Track call counts to verify cardinality constraints.
- Support chaining via `.InSequence()` and `.After()` for ordering.
- Provide human-readable diagnostics on failures.

### 4. OnCallSpec Objects

These capture default behaviors declared by `ON_CALL`. Matching calls without explicit expectations trigger the actions specified here.

### 5. Mock Object Registry

GoogleMock maintains a global registry to:
- Track mock objects and their mock methods.
- Manage strictness levels and reactions to uninteresting calls.
- Support leak detection and verification.

### 6. Strictness Wrappers: NiceMock, NaggyMock, StrictMock

These wrappers specialize mock objects to control handling of uninteresting calls:
- **NiceMock**: Silences warnings, ignores uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock**: (Default) Warns on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as errors.

They derive from the mock class and register appropriate call reactions during construction.

## User Workflow and Data Flow

The following narrative maps the typical user interaction through gMock's core mechanisms.

### Step 1: Creating Mock Classes and Objects

Users define mock classes by inheriting interfaces and declaring mock methods using `MOCK_METHOD`. Mock objects are instantiated like regular C++ objects, optionally wrapped in strictness wrappers like `NiceMock`.

```cpp
class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
   MOCK_METHOD(void, DoThis, (), (override));
   MOCK_METHOD(int, DoThat, (bool flag), (override));
};

NiceMock<MockFoo> mock;
```

### Step 2: Defining Default Actions with `ON_CALL`

`ON_CALL` is used to specify default behaviors when a method is called without an explicit expectation. These actions keep tests maintainable by defining common behavior centrally without enforcing call counts.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock, DoThat(_)).WillByDefault(Return(42));
```

Internally, this adds an `OnCallSpec` to the corresponding `FunctionMocker` of the mock method.

### Step 3: Setting Expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`

`EXPECT_CALL` establishes explicit expectations, including argument matchers, cardinality, ordering, and actions (like `WillOnce` or `WillRepeatedly`).

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, DoThis())
  .Times(2)
  .WillOnce(Invoke([] { std::cout << "First call"; }))
  .WillRepeatedly(Return());
```

This creates a `TypedExpectation` object associated with the function mocker.

### Step 4: Mock Method Invocation

When a mock method is called:
1. It packages the arguments into a tuple and passes them to its `FunctionMocker`.
2. The `FunctionMocker` locks the global mutex to ensure thread safety.
3. It searches expectations in reverse order (newest first) for a matching and active expectation.
4. If a matching expectation is found, it verifies order constraints and call counts.
5. If excessive calls occur, it reports failures.
6. If no expectation matches, the system consults default actions added via `ON_CALL`.
7. If uninteresting calls occur, GoogleMock reacts according to the mock's registered strictness mode.
8. It unlocks the mutex and performs the selected action.

### Step 5: Verification and Teardown

Upon destruction or explicit invocation (`Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`), all mock objects are verified for expected call counts and proper order satisfaction.

## Strictness Modes: Handling Uninteresting Calls

GoogleMock defines distinct mock strictness modes, which affect behavior when a mock method with no matching expectation is called:

- **NaggyMock (Default)**: Prints a warning message about uninteresting calls but otherwise lets the program continue.
- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings, silently ignoring uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as test failures.

This behavior is controlled by internal call registrations performed during construction of these wrappers via `NiceMockImpl`, `NaggyMockImpl`, and `StrictMockImpl` classes that call internal registration API:

- `Mock::AllowUninterestingCalls` (Nice)
- `Mock::WarnUninterestingCalls` (Naggy)
- `Mock::FailUninterestingCalls` (Strict)

Example usage:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_mock;
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_mock;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_mock;
```

Within tests, these wrappers allow fine control over warning verbosity and error sensitivity.

---

## Ordering Constraints: Sequences and Prerequisites

GoogleMock supports ordering calls using:

- **Sequence objects**: Pack expectations into sequences whose calls must happen sequentially.
- **`After` clause**: Specify that an expectation should only match after another expectation or set thereof has been satisfied.

Example:

```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Start()).After(s1);
```

The internal representation tracks sequence membership and prerequisite expectations, ensuring that expectations only match when their order relative to others is valid.

---

## Thread Safety & Synchronization

Given that mock functions may be invoked from multiple threads in concurrent test environments, GoogleMock:

- Uses a global mutex `g_gmock_mutex` to serialize expectation matching and call counting.
- Ensures that actions are performed outside the lock to avoid deadlocks.
- Enforces the rule that setting expectations and default actions (`EXPECT_CALL` / `ON_CALL`) is not done concurrently with mock method calls.

This design guarantees correctness without exposing the user to complex thread management.

---

## Diagnostic and Logging Support

GoogleMock provides detailed diagnostic output for failures and warnings, including:

- File and line number of expectation definitions.
- Call count summaries.
- Argument mismatches with detailed matcher expectations.
- Stack traces (optionally, controlled by `--gmock_verbose` flag).

Users can adjust verbosity with `--gmock_verbose=info|warning|error`.

---

## Integrating Mocks into Test Suites

GoogleMock integrates seamlessly with GoogleTest. When mock objects are destroyed at the end of a test or explicitly verified:

- All expectations are checked.
- Failures result in GoogleTest non-fatal or fatal failures depending on the context.

GoogleMock also allows explicitly verifying and clearing expectations:

```cpp
ASSERT_TRUE(Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj));
```

This enables flexible and fine-grained test designs.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Use `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors** to reduce boilerplate and maintain flexible tests.
- **Reserve `EXPECT_CALL` for actual verification** of call sequences, counts, and arguments.
- **Use `NiceMock` for tests where uninteresting calls are expected and should not clutter output.**
- **Use `StrictMock` sparingly, mainly when you need to catch unexpected calls as errors.**
- **Specify ordering explicitly using `InSequence` or `After` to avoid brittle tests and unclear call order failures.**
- **Avoid nesting strictness wrappers; it's not supported and can lead to undefined behaviors.**
- **Verify and clear expectations before reusing mocks in a test.**
- **Understand that expectations are evaluated in reverse order, so place more specific ones after general catch-alls.**

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Uninteresting call warnings:** Use `NiceMock` or add `EXPECT_CALL` with `Times(AnyNumber())` to suppress.
- **Unexpected calls:** Review argument matchers and ordering constraints.
- **Mock methods calling real functions:** Ensure mocked methods are virtual.
- **Compilation errors with mock methods:** Check correct use of `MOCK_METHOD` and parentheses around complex types.
- **Destructor-related warnings or errors:** Confirm destructors are virtual.
