# Assertion Model and Failure Modes

GoogleTest provides a robust assertion system designed to express test expectations clearly while allowing flexible failure handling. This page explains how GoogleTest assertions work conceptually, the difference between fatal and non-fatal failures, and strategies that ensure tests provide actionable feedback without disrupting the testing flow unnecessarily.

## Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

Assertions are the heart of test validation—they check whether conditions hold true during test execution and report success or failure accordingly. GoogleTest offers a comprehensive set of assertion macros to verify a wide variety of conditions, from simple Boolean checks to complex predicate evaluations.

### Types of Assertions

GoogleTest classifies assertions primarily as **fatal** or **non-fatal**:

- **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_`)** stop the current function immediately upon failure. They protect subsequent code from executing if a crucial condition isn't met. For example, `ASSERT_TRUE(condition)` aborts the test body if `condition` is false.

- **Non-fatal assertions (`EXPECT_`)** report failure but allow the current function to continue running. This is useful to accumulate multiple failures in a single run, providing comprehensive insights about all violated conditions.

Usage example:

```cpp
  ASSERT_NE(pointer, nullptr) << "Pointer must be initialized";
  // If pointer is null, the test function aborts here.

  EXPECT_EQ(value, expected) << "Value mismatch";
  // If values differ, test reports failure but continues.
```

### Why Distinguish Fatal vs Non-Fatal?

This distinction provides granular control over test flow:

- Use **fatal** assertions to guard preconditions critical for safe continuation.
- Use **non-fatal** assertions when you want to check multiple conditions even if some fail.

Understanding this fundamental model helps you design tests that are both robust and informative.

## Assertion Failures: Modes and Handling

GoogleTest not only detects assertion failures but also classifies their impact to maintain a controlled testing environment.

### Non-Fatal Failures

- Reported using `EXPECT_` macros.
- Indicate a test failure but allow subsequent assertions and lines within the current function to execute.
- Allow gathering multiple failure points before halting, useful in scenarios where subsequent checks remain meaningful.

### Fatal Failures

- Reported using `ASSERT_` macros and `FAIL()`.
- Immediately abort the function containing the assertion.
- Reduce redundant errors and prevent undefined behavior from depending on invalid state.

### Explicit Failure Assertions

- `FAIL()` generates a fatal failure manually, useful in unreachable code paths:

  ```cpp
  switch(value) {
    case A: ... break;
    case B: ... break;
    default:
      FAIL() << "Unhandled value: " << value;
  }
  ```

- `ADD_FAILURE()` allows injecting non-fatal failures anywhere in tests.

## Assertion Syntax and Custom Messages

All GoogleTest assertion macros accept streaming of custom failure messages to clarify the cause of failure:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Validation failed for input " << input_value;
ASSERT_EQ(result, expected_result) << "Computation mismatch";
```

These messages appear alongside the failure report, giving immediate context without inspecting code.

---

## How Assertions Work Internally (User Perspective)

When you write an assertion macro, GoogleTest evaluates the condition exactly once and then:

1. Determines if the assertion passes or fails.
2. On failure, classifies it as fatal or non-fatal based on the macro.
3. Records the failure, including file name, line number, and failure message.
4. For fatal assertions, aborts the current function; for non-fatal, continues.

This ensures that failures are immediate and traceable but do not unnecessarily cascade.

---

## Common Use Patterns and Best Practices

- Use **assertions** to verify input parameters, return values, and invariants.
- Prefer `ASSERT_` macros when subsequent code cannot safely continue after failure.
- Use `EXPECT_` macros for multiple independent checks that can run regardless of others failing.
- Include descriptive custom messages on assertions to make debugging faster.
- Combine with matchers for expressive, readable tests (see [Matchers Reference](../api-reference/matchers-and-advanced-utils/builtin-matchers.md)).

---

## Example: Using Assertions Effectively

```cpp
TEST(StringUtilsTest, ToUpperConversion) {
  std::string s = "hello";

  ASSERT_FALSE(s.empty()) << "Input string should not be empty";
  std::string result = ToUpper(s);

  EXPECT_EQ(result, "HELLO") << "Failed to convert to uppercase";
  EXPECT_THAT(result, ::testing::StartsWith("H"));
  EXPECT_NE(result, s) << "Result should differ from input";
}
```

Here, the fatal `ASSERT_FALSE` ensures the input is valid before proceeding. Other `EXPECT_` assertions verify various properties, collecting all failures in one test run.

---

## Understanding Assertion Outcomes

- **Success**: Condition passed; test continues normally.
- **Failure**: Condition failed; failure recorded with details.
- **Fatal failure**: Immediately stops execution of the test function.
- **Non-fatal failure**: Reports failure but continues the function.

This model allows maximum flexibility in testing while providing precise reports.

## Troubleshooting Assertion Failures

If a test fails unexpectedly:

1. Review failure output including file and line.
2. Check custom failure messages for hints.
3. Use `--gtest_print_time` or `--gtest_filter` to isolate failures.
4. Increase verbosity with flags like `--gmock_verbose=info` to see detailed mock call traces if relevant.
5. Reference related matchers or expectations documentation for complex assertions.

## Summary

GoogleTest’s assertion system is the foundation for validating code correctness during testing. By providing clearly classified fatal and non-fatal failure modes with rich messaging and control over test execution flow, it empowers you to write tests that deliver clear, actionable feedback with minimal disruption.
