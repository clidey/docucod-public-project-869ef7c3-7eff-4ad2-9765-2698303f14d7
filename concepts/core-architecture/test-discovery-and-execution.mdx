# Test Discovery and Execution Model

GoogleTest is built on a robust, xUnit-inspired architecture designed to discover, initialize, execute, and report on C++ tests automatically with minimal user intervention. This page breaks down how GoogleTest finds and runs tests, manages their lifecycle, and collects results, helping users understand the behind-the-scenes flow that empowers consistent, repeatable, and informative test executions.

## Understanding Test Discovery

At GoogleTest’s core is an automatic test registration mechanism:

- **Test Suites and Test Cases:** Each test is part of a *test suite* (formerly called a *test case*). When you use macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, GoogleTest internally registers the test with a global registry.

- **Automatic Registration:** This global registry holds all defined tests before execution begins. There's no need to manually list or invoke tests; GoogleTest discovers all tests based on this registry.

- **Registration Timing:** Registration occurs when the test binary loads, before `main()` or the test runner starts. This static initialization ensures all tests are known upfront.


### How Tests Are Identified

- **Naming and Grouping Conventions:** Users group related tests using the `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)` macro, which registers uniquely named tests under suites.

- **Test Fixtures:** Using `TEST_F(TestFixture, TestName)`, tests can share setup and teardown code, enhancing organization and reuse.

- **Test Info Storage:** Metadata such as test suite name, test name, and source location are saved internally, facilitating filtering and reporting.


## Lifecycle: Initialization to Execution

The test executor orchestrates the following flow for each test:

1. **Test Fixture Creation:** If a test is part of a fixture, GoogleTest creates a fresh instance of the fixture class.

2. **Setup Phase:** `SetUp()` is called to prepare any shared environment or preconditions.

3. **Test Body Execution:** The user-defined test code runs. Assertions within may pass or trigger failures.

4. **Teardown Phase:** `TearDown()` is called to clean up and release resources.

5. **Fixture Destruction:** The fixture object is destroyed, ensuring no side effects remain for subsequent tests.


### Isolation and Independence

- Each test runs on its fresh fixture instance, guaranteeing no state leak across tests.

- Execution order is stable but not guaranteed, encouraging users to avoid inter-test dependencies.


## Automatic Test Execution Flow

GoogleTest’s running mechanism revolves around the `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` macro, which initiates:

- **Initialization:** By calling `InitGoogleTest()`, command-line flags are parsed and test environment is configured.

- **Test Iteration:** The framework iterates over each registered test, running it according to the lifecycle described.

- **Assertion Monitoring:** During tests, assertion outcomes are recorded, categorizing results as successes, nonfatal failures, or fatal failures.

- **Fixture Management:** SetUp/TearDown calls wrap each test, with automatic clean-up.

- **Fail Fast Behavior:** Fatal failures abort the current test but not the entire run, enabling partial test progress.

- **Result Collection:** Individual test outcomes create a comprehensive report at the end.


### Execution Result Reporting

- **Per-Test Feedback:** Each test outputs its status (PASSED, FAILED) with contextual information.

- **Summary:** A concise summary at the end shows how many tests succeeded, failed, or were skipped.

- **Failure Details:** Where failures occur, precise file and line references help debugging.


## Integration With GoogleMock

While GoogleTest manages test lifecycle, GoogleMock extends this model for mock objects:

- Expectations (`EXPECT_CALL`) and default behaviors (`ON_CALL`) are registered before test execution.

- Mock verifications automatically happen at the end of test executions.

- The framework ensures mocks clean up properly even on test failures.


## Practical Example: A Typical User Flow

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Simple test case
TEST(MathTest, SquareRoot) {
  EXPECT_EQ(16, 4 * 4);
}

// Using a test fixture
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize queue here
  }
  void TearDown() override {
    // Clean up
  }
  // Queue q_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsEmptyInitially) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(true);  // Assume q_ is empty
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);  // Initializes framework and parses flags
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();               // Discovers and runs all tests
}
```

In this flow:
- `InitGoogleTest` reads flags and prepares the environment.
- `RUN_ALL_TESTS` discovers `MathTest.SquareRoot` and `QueueTest.IsEmptyInitially`, running them sequentially.
- For `QueueTest`, it creates a fixture instance, calls `SetUp()`, executes the test, calls `TearDown()`, and destroys the fixture.
- Results are reported to stdout with detailed information.


## Troubleshooting Common Test Discovery and Execution Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Test Discovery and Execution">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Running or Discovered">
Check that your `main()` calls `InitGoogleTest()` and `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`. Ensure tests are linked into the binary and that the macro syntax (`TEST` or `TEST_F`) is correct. Avoid namespaces or macros that might prevent test registration.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Run but Fail Without Output">
Inspect assertions in tests. Use verbose flags (e.g., `--gtest_verbose=info`) to get detailed output. Ensure your test code does not swallow failures silently.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Fixture Setup/TearDown Not Called">
Confirm you use `TEST_F` for tests using fixtures. Verify your `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods have correct signatures and `override` specifier if appropriate.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Key Best Practices

- Always use `InitGoogleTest()` before running tests to ensure flags and environment are ready.

- Each test should be independent; rely on fresh fixture instances per test.

- Use test fixtures to share setup code, improving clarity and maintainability.

- Run tests frequently with `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to validate complete coverage.

- Leverage GoogleMock expectations and control to integrate mocks safely in tests.
