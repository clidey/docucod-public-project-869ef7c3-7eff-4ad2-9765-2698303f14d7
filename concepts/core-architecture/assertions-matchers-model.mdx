# Assertions, Matchers, & Failure Handling

GoogleTest empowers C++ developers with a rich system of assertions and matchers to write expressive, precise test validations. This guide explores how GoogleTest’s assertion macros and GoogleMock’s matcher framework cooperate to let you verify program behavior clearly and efficiently while providing immediate, detailed failure diagnostics.

---

## Understanding Assertions in GoogleTest

Assertions are the primary means by which you check assumptions in your tests. GoogleTest provides two broad types:

- **Nonfatal assertions (`EXPECT_`)** continue test execution after failure, allowing multiple failure points per test.
- **Fatal assertions (`ASSERT_`)** abort the current function upon failure.

All assertions support streaming custom messages to provide context when tests fail:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(is_valid) << "Validation failed for input " << input_value;
```

### Types of Assertions You’ll Use

- **Explicit success/failure:** `SUCCEED()`, `FAIL()`, `ADD_FAILURE()` let you document or trigger test outcomes explicitly.
- **Boolean conditions:** For simple true/false checks using `EXPECT_TRUE()`/`ASSERT_TRUE()`, etc.
- **Binary comparisons:** Check equality, inequality, and ordering via macros like `EXPECT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_NE()`, `EXPECT_LT()`, and their fatal counterparts.
- **String comparisons:** Specialized macros such as `EXPECT_STREQ()` for C strings offer value-based string verification.
- **Floating-point comparisons:** `EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ()`, `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ()`, and `EXPECT_NEAR()` provide handling for the imprecision inherent in floating-point arithmetic.
- **Exception assertions:** Verify whether certain code throws (or not) specific exception types using `EXPECT_THROW()`, `EXPECT_ANY_THROW()`, and related macros.
- **Predicate assertions:** Enable richer checks with predicates and predicate-formatter functions.

## GoogleMock Matchers: Enhancing Assertions

Matchers in GoogleMock serve as flexible predicates for validating arguments passed to mocked functions, empowering you to create highly readable and maintainable tests.

### Core Concepts of Matchers

- **Matchers** are abstractions representing Boolean predicates with self-describing capabilities to explain failures.
- They work seamlessly with GoogleTest’s `EXPECT_THAT(value, matcher)` and `ASSERT_THAT(value, matcher)`.
- Basic values (like integers, C strings) implicitly convert to built-in matchers (e.g., `Eq(value)`).

### Commonly Used Matchers

- Wildcard `_`: Matches any value.
- Equality and comparison: `Eq()`, `Ne()`, `Lt()`, `Le()`, `Gt()`, `Ge()`.
- Container element matchers: `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `Contains()`, `Each()`, and more.
- String matchers: `StrEq()`, `HasSubstr()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()`.
- Pointer and reference matchers: `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`, `Ref()`, `Pointee()`.

### Advanced and Custom Matchers

You can define:

- **Custom matchers** with `MATCHER()`, `MATCHER_P()`, and others for parametric predicates.
- **Composite matchers** combining other matchers with logical operators like `AllOf()` and `AnyOf()`.
- Type-polymorphic matchers that adapt to argument types.

### Practical Usage Examples

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Gt;
using ::testing::Return;

class MockFoo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (int n), (override));
};

TEST(FooTest, ReturnsValueGreaterThan10) {
  MockFoo mock;
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(Gt(10)))  // Bar called with a value > 10
      .WillOnce(Return(42));
  EXPECT_EQ(42, mock.Bar(15));
}
```

## How GoogleTest Detects and Reports Failures

When an assertion or expectation fails, GoogleTest captures extensive diagnostic context:

- Source file and line number.
- Expected vs actual values with descriptive mismatch explanations.
- Stack traces for many mock call failures when verbosity is enabled.

### Fatal vs Nonfatal Failures in GoogleTest

- **Fatal failures:** Immediately abort the current test function.
- **Nonfatal failures:** Log the failure but allow the test to continue running.

Understanding this distinction helps you decide how strictly your tests respond to failures.

### Diagnosing Mock Call Failures

GoogleMock enriches failure messages by:

- Showing all expectations evaluated and why each did or did not match.
- Detailing argument mismatches with values and why they failed.
- Reporting call count mismatches, including over- and under-invocation.
- Highlighting order violations when ordering constraints are used.

Enabled as part of the mock’s output configuration, verbose failure reporting can greatly accelerate debugging.

## Key Practices & Tips

- **Set expectations before exercising mocks:** `EXPECT_CALL` statements must precede any invocation of the mocked method.
- **Use `_` matcher for arguments you don’t care to constrain.**
- **Prefer `ON_CALL` for setting default behavior when you don't want to impose strict expectations.**
- **Be mindful of expectation cardinality (`Times()`) and use `RetiresOnSaturation()` if you want expectations to retire when saturated.**
- **Group ordered expectations with `InSequence` to enforce call order.**
- **Use `EXPECT_THAT` with matchers for expressive and maintainable checks.**
- **Suppress uninteresting call warnings in noisy mocks with `NiceMock`.**

## Example Walkthrough: Mocking & Validating Calls

Let's consider a simple example where a mock method is expected to be called twice with specific arguments:

```cpp
class MockCalculator {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Add, (int a, int b), (override));
};

TEST(CalculatorTest, AddCalledTwiceWithExpectedArgs) {
  MockCalculator calc;

  EXPECT_CALL(calc, Add(1, 2)).Times(2).WillRepeatedly(Return(3));

  EXPECT_EQ(3, calc.Add(1, 2));  // First call, returns 3
  EXPECT_EQ(3, calc.Add(1, 2));  // Second call, returns 3
}
```

If the method is called a third time or with different arguments, GoogleMock will report an error showing the mismatch and expected call counts.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Failures

- **Unexpected calls:** Occur when a mock method is invoked that has no matching `EXPECT_CALL` specification.
- **Too few/many calls:** The number of actual calls does not satisfy the `Times()` cardinality.
- **Argument mismatches:** Detailed mismatch info indicates which argument didn’t satisfy the matcher.
- **Ordering violations:** If `InSequence` or `After` constraints are specified, calls happening out-of-order trigger failures.

Use verbose flags like `--gmock_verbose=info` during test runs to get detailed diagnostics on these failures.
