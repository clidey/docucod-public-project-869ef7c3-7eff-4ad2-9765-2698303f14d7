# Mocking Fundamentals with GoogleMock

Understanding the conceptual basis of mocking in C++ using GoogleMock (gMock) means grasping how dependencies, expectations, and behaviors are modeled through mock classes. GoogleMock allows you to focus on *interactions* between your code and its dependencies by specifying what you expect to happen during execution, and automatically verifying these at test time.

---

## Introduction to Mocking

**Mock objects** mimic the interfaces of real dependencies but allow detailed control over their behavior and the ability to set expectations on how they will be used. Instead of relying on real components—which might be unavailable, slow, or non-deterministic—you use mock objects to isolate and verify your code’s interactions.

### Why Mock?

Mocks are essential for interaction-based testing where you want to validate:
- Which methods are called,
- With what arguments,
- How many times,
- In which order,
- And what results or side effects they produce.

Unlike *fake objects* (which provide functional implementations but may simplify or shortcut), *mocks* specify expected calls and help detect deviations from those expectations.

## Mock Classes: Representing Dependencies

In GoogleMock, mocking starts by creating a mock class from an interface or an abstract class. The mock class inherits from the original interface and uses the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to generate mock implementations for its virtual methods.

### Defining Mock Methods

```cpp
class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  // ... other methods
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  // ... mocked methods
};
```

- `MOCK_METHOD` automatically generates all boilerplate needed to record and check how methods are called.
- Methods must be mocked *publicly* in the mock class, even if they are protected or private in the base class.
- Qualifiers like `const` and calling conventions are supported via optional macro parameters.

### Purpose of Mock Classes

- Replace real dependencies with controllable objects.
- Enable setting fine-grained expectations for method calls.
- Facilitate verifying the interaction contract between components.

## Expectations: Specifying Intended Interactions

Expectations define *what* you expect your code to call on the mock object. You set expectations using `EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, method(args))`.

### General Form

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(Matchers...))
    .Times(Cardinality)
    .WillOnce(Action)
    .WillRepeatedly(Action);
```

- **Matchers** specify argument constraints (exact values, wildcards, predicates).
- **Cardinalities** describe the expected number of calls (e.g., exactly 1, at least 2).
- **Actions** determine what the mock does when called (returns values, invokes callbacks, etc).

### Matchers: Matching Arguments

- Use explicit values or matcher objects like `_` (wildcard), `Eq(5)`, `Ge(100)`.
- Specify only the arguments important to your test to avoid brittle tests.
- When a method is overloaded, specify matchers to disambiguate overloads.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GoTo(50, _));  // x = 50, y = anything
```

### Cardinalities: Controlling How Often

- Use `Times()` with predefined cardinalities:
  - `Exactly(n)` or `n` — expect exactly `n` calls
  - `AtLeast(n)` — expect at least `n` calls
  - `AnyNumber()` — any number of calls allowed
  - `Between(m, n)` — between `m` and `n` calls
- If `Times` is omitted, gMock infers it based on how many `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()` you specify.

### Actions: Defining Behavior

- Default action returns default values (0, false, default-constructed objects).
- Override behavior with `.WillOnce()` and `.WillRepeatedly()`.
- Chaining allows specifying different actions for calls in sequence.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;
EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
    .WillOnce(Return(100))
    .WillOnce(Return(200))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(300));
```

### Multiple Expectations and Ordering

- Later expectations override earlier ones when matching calls.
- To enforce call order, use sequences or `InSequence` blocks.
- Expectations are *sticky* by default; they remain active even after saturation unless explicitly retired.

Example partial ordering:

```cpp
using ::testing::InSequence;
{
  InSequence s;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown());
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenUp());
}
```

Calls to mocked methods must match the expected order.

## Mock Object Behavior Variants

GoogleMock provides variants of mocks controlling behavior on *uninteresting calls* (calls with no matching expectation):

- **NiceMock**: suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock**: (default) warns about uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: treats uninteresting calls as errors.

All are subclasses of the mock class and can be constructed with the same arguments.

Example:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(nice_foo, DoSomething());
```

Choose according to how strict you want your test verification to be.

---

## User Workflow: Using Mocks in Tests

1. Include gMock and import necessary `testing` namespace elements.
2. Create mock objects (`MockTurtle turtle;`).
3. Set expectations (`EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));`).
4. Exercise code that uses the mocks.
5. GoogleMock verifies expectations automatically on destruction, reporting errors immediately on violation.

Example test:

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

using ::testing::AtLeast;

TEST(PainterTest, DrawsWithPenDown) {
  MockTurtle turtle;
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));

  Painter painter(&turtle);
  EXPECT_TRUE(painter.DrawCircle(0, 0, 10));
}
```

If `PenDown()` is not called as expected, the test fails with a detailed error.

---

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Specify expectations **before** exercising the mock — calling `EXPECT_CALL` after mock invocations leads to undefined behavior.
- Avoid over-specifying arguments for matchers — be as specific as necessary but no more.
- When mocking methods with non-copyable or move-only arguments (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`), use the familiar `MOCK_METHOD` macro directly; actions can use lambdas returning new instances.
- Use sequences to enforce call orders without making tests brittle.
- For methods that take many arguments, consider writing forwarding mock methods with simplified signatures for ease of mocking.
- Use `RetiresOnSaturation()` to make expectations inactive after they have been fully met, useful for layered expectations.
- To reduce warnings for uninteresting calls, wrap mocks in `NiceMock` or use catch-all expectations with `Times(AnyNumber())`.
- Always have virtual destructors in interfaces intended for mocking.

## Summary

GoogleMock lets you model dependencies by creating mock classes with mocked virtual methods. Through `EXPECT_CALL`, you define precise expectations about the arguments, call count, order, and behaviors of those methods in your tests. Matchers allow flexible argument specification, while cardinalities define call frequency. Actions tell mocks what to do when invoked.

Choosing mock variants like `NiceMock` and `StrictMock` helps you control how strictly uninteresting calls are handled. Setting clear expectations before exercising your test code ensures early detection and clear failure messages. This interaction-driven testing approach improves test isolation, readability, and reliability.
