# Mocking: Concepts and Mechanisms

Understanding mocking in GoogleMock is foundational for creating precise and effective unit tests by simulating complex or external dependencies. This guide unpacks the philosophy behind mock objects, how to define mock classes and methods, and how expectations and call behaviors are orchestrated to enable reliable test verification.

---

## What is Mocking?

Mocking is a testing technique where you replace a real object with a simulated one, called a *mock object*. Mock objects mimic the interfaces of real objects but allow you to specify how they behave and interact with your code under test. This enables you to:

- Isolate the unit being tested, by simulating dependencies that are complex, slow, or have side effects.
- Precisely specify and verify how your code interacts with these dependencies.
- Control the return values and side effects to exercise different code paths.

Unlike *fakes*, mocks focus on *expectations* — what methods will be called, with which arguments, in which order, and how many times. GoogleMock supports this interaction-based testing approach with an intuitive yet powerful syntax.

## Creating Mock Classes and Methods

### Defining Mock Methods

To create mocks in GoogleMock, you define mock classes using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to generate mocked methods. A mock method simulates a corresponding interface or virtual method in your actual class.

```cpp
class MockExample {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(ReturnType, MethodName, (ArgTypes...), (Qualifiers));
};
```

- **ReturnType**: The return type of the method.
- **MethodName**: The function name.
- **ArgTypes**: Method arguments enclosed in parentheses.
- **Qualifiers**: Optional specifiers like `const`, `override`, or calling conventions.

#### Practical Tips
- Always place mock methods in the `public:` section of the mock class, even if the original is protected or private — this is necessary for `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` to work.

- For types with commas (like `std::pair<int, int>`), wrap the entire type in parentheses or use a type alias to avoid parsing errors.

- For overloaded methods, mock all overloads you intend to use to avoid hiding base class methods unexpectedly.

---

## The Role of Expectations

### `EXPECT_CALL` — Setting Expectations

`EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers...))` specifies that a mock method is expected to be called in your test. You can chain modifier clauses to define:

- How many times it should be called (`Times()`).
- With what argument matchers.
- What it should do (`WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`).
- Ordering constraints like `InSequence()` and `After()`.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_obj, DoSomething(42))
    .Times(3)
    .WillOnce(Return(true))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(false));
```

This example says `DoSomething` must be called exactly 3 times with argument `42`, returning `true` the first time and `false` thereafter.

**Key Modifiers:**
- `.With()` applies a matcher to the argument tuple overall.
- `.InSequence()` enforces call order.
- `.After()` specifies dependencies on other expectations.
- `.RetiresOnSaturation()` auto-deactivates an expectation after it's fulfilled.

### `ON_CALL` — Defining Default Behavior

`ON_CALL` sets the default behavior for mock methods but does *not* set an expectation that the method must be called.

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_obj, Compute(_)).WillByDefault(Return(100));
```

If you do not set an `EXPECT_CALL`, the method calls are considered *uninteresting*. By default, uninteresting calls produce warnings unless you suppress them with `NiceMock` or explicitly expect them.

---

## Understanding Call Types

Mock function calls fall into these categories:

- **Expected calls:** Match an `EXPECT_CALL` with the right arguments and number of invocations.
- **Unexpected calls:** Occur when there are matching `EXPECT_CALL`s but the arguments don't match any.
- **Uninteresting calls:** No `EXPECT_CALL` exists for the method.

### Uninteresting Call Behavior
- By default, uninteresting calls produce warnings.
- Use `NiceMock<MockClass>` to suppress warnings for uninteresting calls.
- Use `StrictMock<MockClass>` to treat uninteresting calls as test failures.
- The default mock type behaves like a `NaggyMock`, which warns but doesn't fail on uninteresting calls.

### Strictness Wrappers

GoogleMock provides convenient wrappers to control mock object strictness:

| Wrapper                 | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `NiceMock<MockClass>`   | Suppresses warnings (quiet).
| `NaggyMock<MockClass>`  | Prints warnings (default behavior).
| `StrictMock<MockClass>` | Treats uninteresting calls as errors (fail).

They inherit constructors, so usage is seamless:

```cpp
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice;
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict;
```

**Important:** These wrappers affect only uninteresting calls, *not* unexpected calls.

---

## Sequencing and Ordering

GoogleMock lets you define expectations that must be met in a particular order for your tests to pass.

### `InSequence`

Using the `InSequence` object inside a scope causes all `EXPECT_CALL`s in that scope to be part of an implicit execution sequence. Calls must happen in the declared order.

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;  // Begin sequence scope

  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Init());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Execute());
  EXPECT_CALL(mock, Cleanup());
}
```

### `Sequence` Objects

For complex ordering, define sequence objects explicitly and assign expectations to them:

```cpp
Sequence s1, s2;
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step1()).InSequence(s1);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step2()).InSequence(s2);
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Step3()).InSequence(s1, s2);
```

Here `Step3` is expected after both sequences.

### `After` Clause

Set an expectation to occur only after one or more expectations:

```cpp
Expectation e1 = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Start());
Expectation e2 = EXPECT_CALL(mock, Prepare());
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Finish()).After(e1, e2);
```

---

## Matching Arguments

GoogleMock supports powerful matchers to validate that mock method arguments meet your expectations.

- Use basic matchers like `_` (any), `Eq(value)`, `Ge(value)` (greater or equal).
- Use composite matchers (`AllOf`, `AnyOf`, `Not`).
- Use member validators (`Field()`, `Property()`) for complex objects.
- Use `With()` to match the entire argument tuple.

For example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, SetPosition(_, _)).With(Lt());  // First argument less than second
```

---

## Actions and Behavior

Define what mock methods do when called using `WillOnce()`, `WillRepeatedly()`, and similar clauses:

- `Return(value)`: Return a fixed value.
- `ReturnRef(ref)`: Return a reference.
- `Invoke(function)`: Call a user-defined function or lambda.
- `DoAll(actions...)`: Perform multiple actions in sequence.

Default actions apply if no explicit action is set. Use `ON_CALL` to set these defaults.

You can use lambdas, function pointers, functors, or other callables as custom actions.

---

## Verification

Mocks automatically verify at destruction that all expectations have been met. You can also verify explicitly:

```cpp
Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);
```

If expectations are not met, GoogleTest reports failures.

---

## Best Practices

- Start with `ON_CALL` to configure default behavior.
- Add `EXPECT_CALL` only when you need to verify interaction.
- Use `NiceMock` for less noisy tests, `StrictMock` to enforce strict call discipline.
- Use sequences or `After` for ordered interactions.
- Prefer concise argument matchers to avoid over-specification.
- Avoid mixing setting expectations and making calls; expectations must be set before exercising the mock.

---

## Summary

Mocking in GoogleMock is a powerful approach for simulating dependencies, precisely specifying and verifying interactions, and controlling mock behavior for robust, maintainable tests. By defining mock methods with `MOCK_METHOD`, setting expectations via `EXPECT_CALL` and defaults with `ON_CALL`, and managing strictness and ordering, developers can craft tests that clearly express intended behavior.
