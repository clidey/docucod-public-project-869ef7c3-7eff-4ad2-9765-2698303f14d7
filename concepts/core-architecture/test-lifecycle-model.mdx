# Test Lifecycle & Execution Model

GoogleTest employs a clear, structured lifecycle and execution model rooted in the xUnit architecture to enable scalable, robust C++ testing. This guide helps you understand how GoogleTest manages test discovery, test registration, setup, execution, and teardown, ensuring your tests are organized, repeatable, and straightforward to run.

## Overview: How GoogleTest Runs Your Tests

When you write tests in GoogleTest using macros like `TEST()` or `TEST_F()`, GoogleTest automatically registers them for execution. The typical flow when running tests looks like this:

1. **Initialization:**  You call `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` to initialize the framework. This parses GoogleTest-specific command-line flags and prepares the environment.

2. **Test Registration:**
   - Each test defined via the `TEST()` or `TEST_F()` macros creates an internal `TestInfo` object.
   - `TestInfo` objects are grouped into `TestSuite`s (formerly called TestCases), each representing a collection of related tests.

3. **Test Execution:**
   - Invoking `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` starts the test run.
   - GoogleTest iterates through each `TestSuite` and then through each `TestInfo` (test) within it.
   - Before a `TestSuite`'s tests run, GoogleTest calls `SetUpTestSuite()` for any global setup.
   - For each test:
     - A fresh test fixture object is created.
     - The fixture's `SetUp()` method is executed.
     - The test body (`TestBody()`) runs.
     - The fixture's `TearDown()` method runs.
     - The fixture object is destroyed.
   - After all tests in a `TestSuite` have run, `TearDownTestSuite()` is called.

4. **Reporting:**
   - GoogleTest tracks individual test results, including passes, failures, and skips.
   - Event listeners receive notifications on test start, test part result (assertions), test end, and suite start/end.
   - Reporting outputs (console, XML, JSON) are generated based on these events.

5. **Finalization:**
   - The aggregated test results determine the program's exit code.
   - Global test environments' `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` are called before and after test iteration(s).

## Test Components and Their Roles

### Test

- Represents an individual test.
- Derived from the abstract `testing::Test` class or a fixture subclass.
- Defines `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, and the test logic in `TestBody()`.
- Each test runs in isolation with a fresh fixture instance.

### TestInfo

- Contains metadata about a test, such as its name and test suite.
- Holds the factory to create the test fixture instance.
- Manages the test result storage.

### TestSuite

- A named collection of tests, grouping logically related tests.
- Has associated lifecycle callbacks: `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` for shared setup/teardown.
- Tracks which tests should run, their order, and aggregated results.

### UnitTest

- Singleton representing the entire test program.
- Manages all test suites, global environments, and event listeners.
- Responsible for coordinating test filtering, sharding, iteration, and result collection.

### Environment

- Represents global set-up and tear-down for the entire run (e.g., initializing resources before any test).
- Registered via `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()`.

### TestEventListener

- Interface for hooking into the test flow.
- Methods correspond to lifecycle events such as test start/end, assertion results, environments setup/teardown.
- Users can implement listeners to customize output or integrate with external systems.

## Defining and Registering Tests

You write tests using macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or advanced forms like `TEST_P()`:

- `TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName)`: Defines a basic test function.
- `TEST_F(TestFixture, TestName)`: Defines a test using a test fixture class.
- Each macro internally registers the test with GoogleTest before `main()` runs.

GoogleTest internally creates `TestInfo` instances for each test and groups them into `TestSuite`s, automatically handling duplicates or naming conflicts.

---

## Test Execution Flow

GoogleTest runs tests with these logical steps:

1. **TestSuites Enumeration:**
   - GoogleTest iterates over all registered `TestSuite`s.
   - The order is stable and sorted lexicographically by source file and line number.

2. **Global Set-Up:**
   - Runs registered `Environment` objects' `SetUp()` methods before tests.
   - Then calls each `TestSuite`'s `SetUpTestSuite()` method.

3. **Running Tests in a TestSuite:**
   For each test in the suite:
   - The test fixture object is created.
   - `SetUp()` is called to prepare the fixture.
   - `TestBody()` executes the actual test code.
   - `TearDown()` cleans up.
   - The fixture object is deleted.

4. **Global Tear-Down:**
   - Each `TestSuite`'s `TearDownTestSuite()` is called after all its tests run.
   - Finally, all `Environment`s' `TearDown()` methods are invoked, in reverse order.

5. **Result Aggregation and Reporting:**
   - Each test produces a `TestResult` containing assertion results, timing, and properties.
   - Aggregated results for tests and suites determine pass/fail status.
   - Event listeners contribute to reporting and custom handling.

6. **Repeat, Shuffle, and Sharding:**
   - Flags such as `--gtest_repeat` can cause tests to repeat multiple times.
   - Tests and suites might be shuffled randomly with `--gtest_shuffle`.
   - Sharding environment variables split test execution across machines as appropriate.

## Test Fixture Lifecycle Details

GoogleTest enforces that each test runs inside its own fresh test fixture instance for isolation:

- **Creation:** GoogleTest creates a new instance of the test fixture for every test.
- **SetUp:** `SetUp()` method is called after construction.
- **TestBody:** The actual test logic runs.
- **TearDown:** After `TestBody()`, `TearDown()` is called regardless of test outcome.
- **Destruction:** The fixture object is deleted after `TearDown()`.

This cycle guarantees that tests do not affect each other's state.

Additionally, `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` static methods allow resource sharing across all tests in a suite, useful for expensive setup.

---

## Handling Test Results and Failures

GoogleTest tracks detailed results per test and per assertion:

- Individual assertions create `TestPartResult`s with types:  success, non-fatal failure, fatal failure, or skipped.
- Fatal failures abort the current test method early but do NOT stop the overall test program.
- Non-fatal failures allow tests to continue to reveal multiple issues.
- Skipped tests are supported via the `GTEST_SKIP()` macro.
- Test results include start time, elapsed time, properties, and failure metadata.

All test results propagate up to the `TestSuite` and `UnitTest` summaries.

---

## Event Listener API: Monitoring and Customizing Test Execution

GoogleTest offers an event listener interface allowing users to hook into test lifecycle events:

- Listen for program start and end events.
- Monitor test suite and test start/end.
- Receive callbacks for each assertion result.
- Observe setup and teardown of global environments.

This API enables custom reporters, logging enhancements, or integration with external tools.

Example:

```cpp
class SimplePrinter : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting " << test_info.test_suite_name() << "." 
              << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};
...
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners().Append(new SimplePrinter);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

---

## Advanced Execution Controls

GoogleTest supports a variety of command-line flags and features to customize test execution:

- **Filtering**: Run subsets of tests by names with `--gtest_filter`.
- **Disabling**: Prefix test or suite names with `DISABLED_` to skip them.
- **Repetition**: Repeat tests multiple times for flaky test diagnosis with `--gtest_repeat`.
- **Fail-Fast**: Stop running tests at first failure with `--gtest_fail_fast`.
- **Shuffling**: Randomize order of tests with `--gtest_shuffle` and set seeds with `--gtest_random_seed`.
- **Sharding**: Distribute tests across machines via environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Isolate tests:** Use fresh fixtures for each test to avoid unintended interactions.
- **Group logically:** Organize related tests into suites that mirror your code structure.
- **Leverage fixtures:** Use `SetUpTestSuite()` for expensive shared resources.
- **Watch failures:** Understand failure types (fatal vs non-fatal) and use assertions accordingly.
- **Use event listeners:** Customize test run reporting and integrate with CI systems.
- **Control execution flow:** Use filtering, repetition, and disabling to manage test runs efficiently.
