# Test Lifecycle and Execution Model

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive, managed lifecycle that encompasses all stages of test execution: from initial discovery of test cases through fixture setup, running test bodies, assertion handling, teardown, and result reporting. This model is designed to give developers reliable, repeatable test runs with rich diagnostics and integration-friendly event hooks.

---

## 1. High-Level Test Execution Flow

### 1.1 Test Discovery and Registration

Tests are automatically registered when declared with macros (e.g., `TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`) or dynamically registered via `RegisterTest()`. Each test belongs to a test suite (formerly "test case"), enabling logical grouping. Internally, GoogleTest stores these as `TestInfo` objects within `TestSuite` containers.

During test discovery:
- Tests are indexed and filtered according to user-provided patterns and flags.
- Disabled tests (named with `DISABLED_` prefix) are generally excluded unless overridden by flags.
- Sharding variables (`GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`) determine if a test belongs to the current shard and thus should run.

### 1.2 Test Environment Setup

Before tests execute, global `Environment` objects registered via `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` have their `SetUp()` method called sequentially. This occurs prior to any test suite or test execution and can be repeated if tests are rerun.

### 1.3 Test Suite Setup

For each test suite selected to run, its static `SetUpTestSuite()` function is called once before any tests in the suite run, allowing expensive shared resource initialization.

### 1.4 Individual Test Execution

Each test follows this lifecycle:

1. Create a fresh test fixture object.
2. Invoke the test fixture's instance `SetUp()` method.
3. Run the test code in the `TestBody()` implementation.
4. Capture assertion results during test execution.
5. Call the test fixture's instance `TearDown()` method.
6. Delete the fixture object.

If a fatal failure occurs (e.g., via `ASSERT_*`), execution of the current test stops immediately. Non-fatal failures (`EXPECT_*`) allow the test to continue but mark it as failed.

Users can also skip tests at runtime using `GTEST_SKIP()`, which marks tests as skipped without failure.

### 1.5 Test Suite Teardown

After all tests in a suite complete, the static `TearDownTestSuite()` method is called, releasing shared resources.

### 1.6 Global Environment Teardown

Finally, after all suites run, global `Environment` objects have their `TearDown()` methods called in reverse registration order.

### 1.7 Test Iterations and Repeat

GoogleTest supports repeating test executions (via the `--gtest_repeat` flag) with all setup and teardown phases repeated as specified. Test shuffling and randomized seeding enable detection of test interdependencies.

---

## 2. Test States and Results

### 2.1 Test Outcome Tracking

Each test's result is stored in a `TestResult` object containing:
- Assertion outcomes (`TestPartResult`), including file, line, and message.
- Execution timings: start timestamp and elapsed time in milliseconds.
- Test properties recorded via `RecordProperty()`.

Tests can have four high-level result states:
- **Success:** No failures.
- **Non-fatal failure:** Some assertions failed but test continues.
- **Fatal failure:** Execution aborted due to a critical assertion.
- **Skipped:** Explicitly skipped at runtime.

### 2.2 Aggregates

Test suite and program results are aggregates of contained tests. They track counts such as passed, failed, skipped, and disabled. GoogleTest's console and XML/JSON output summarize these aggregates.

---

## 3. Event Listeners and Hooks

GoogleTest implements a rich observer pattern via the `TestEventListener` interface, allowing users to track test lifecycle events for:
- Test program start/end
- Test iterations
- Global environment setup/teardown
- Test suite setup/start/end
- Individual test start, assertion results, end

Users can create custom listeners by subclassing either `TestEventListener` (interface) or `EmptyTestEventListener` (empty default methods). These can be registered with `UnitTest::listeners().Append()`.

### Listener Event Ordering
- `On*Start()` methods are invoked in registration order.
- `On*End()` methods are called in reverse order to allow framing output.

By customizing listeners, users can tailor output formats, integrate with other tools, or perform profiling and diagnostics.

---

## 4. Main Entry Points

### 4.1 `InitGoogleTest()`

This function initializes GoogleTest state, parsing command-line flags (like filters, repeat counts, output modes) and configuring the internal test registry and listeners. This must be called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.

### 4.2 `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

Called from `main()` to execute all registered tests. It:
- Runs global environment setup.
- Executes all test suites and their tests respecting filters and sharding.
- Runs teardowns in reverse order.
- Reports summary results.
- Returns `0` on success, `1` if any test failed.

Users should ensure not to ignore the return value and only call this once.

---

## 5. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Group Tests using Test Suites:** Use test suites (`TEST()`) and fixtures (`TEST_F()`) for well-organized, repeatable tests.
- **Use Setup/TearDown for Shared Resources:** To avoid costly setup per test, use `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()`.
- **Use Event Listeners for Custom Reporting:** To customize output or integrate test results with external tools.
- **Leverage Skipping:** Use `GTEST_SKIP()` in setup or tests to conditionally skip functionality.
- **Manage Assertion Failures:** Understand difference between fatal (`ASSERT_*`) and non-fatal (`EXPECT_*`) to control test flow.
- **Filter Tests and Manage Sharding:** Use `--gtest_filter` and environment vars for selective test runs and parallelization.

## 6. Example: Writing a Custom TestEventListener

```cpp
class MyListener : public testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    printf("Starting test %s.%s\n", test_info.test_suite_name(), test_info.name());
  }
  void OnTestPartResult(const testing::TestPartResult& result) override {
    if (result.failed()) {
      printf("Failure: %s at %s:%d\n", result.summary(),
             result.file_name(), result.line_number());
    }
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    printf("Finished test %s.%s%s\n", test_info.test_suite_name(), test_info.name(),
           test_info.result()->Passed() ? " (PASSED)" : " (FAILED)");
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners().Append(new MyListener);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This listener prints custom messages on test start, any assertion failure, and test end.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Lifecycle Issues

- **Tests Not Running:** Check filtering flags (`--gtest_filter`) and sharding environment variables.
- **No Tests Discovered:** Verify tests are linked and registered correctly.
- **Setup/TearDown Not Called:** Ensure proper override spelling and accessibility (`public static` for suite setup).
- **Test Skipped Unexpectedly:** Check usage of `GTEST_SKIP()` and environment constraints.

### Callouts

<Check>
Make sure to call `::testing::InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to initialize flags and test registry.
</Check>

<Warning>
Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same test suite; all tests in a suite must use the same fixture class.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Register custom test event listeners to tailor output for specialized needs such as GUI reports, custom logs, or resource leak detection.
</Tip>

<Note>
`GTEST_SKIP()` can be used in test body or setup methods to skip test execution at runtime without failure.
