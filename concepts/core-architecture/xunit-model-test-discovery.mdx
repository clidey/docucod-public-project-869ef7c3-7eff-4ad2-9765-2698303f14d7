# xUnit Model and Test Discovery

Delve into how GoogleTest adapts the familiar xUnit architecture to enable efficient test organization, execution, and discovery. This page explains the underlying concepts and workflows that let developers structure tests with repeatable setup, execution, and teardown phases while benefiting from automatic test registration.

## Introduction to the xUnit Model in GoogleTest

GoogleTest adopts the xUnit testing framework architecture, widely recognized for its systematic approach to writing and managing tests. This model organizes tests into three fundamental layers:

- **Test Fixture**: Establishes the context for tests by setting up shared objects and cleaning them up after each test.
- **Test Case (Test Suite)**: Groups related tests that share a fixture, enabling collective management and execution.
- **Test**: Individual test functions that exercise specific scenarios of the code under test.

In GoogleTest, this architecture encourages test independence, clarity, and maintainability by isolating each test's context and cleanly grouping logically related tests.

### Benefits of the xUnit Architecture

- **Isolation**: Each test runs with a freshly set-up fixture, ensuring no side effects leak between tests.
- **Structured Organization**: The grouping of tests within test suites reflects logical relationships in the codebase.
- **Lifecycle Control**: Clear setup and teardown stages at both individual test and suite levels optimize resource management.

## Test Fixture Lifecycle and Behavior

A *test fixture* class, usually derived from `testing::Test`, prepares common objects and state for multiple tests. Each test is run on a new instance of this fixture:

1. **Fixture Construction**: An object instance is created.
2. **Setup**: The `SetUp()` method is called to initialize the runtime context.
3. **Test Execution**: The actual test function runs.
4. **Teardown**: The `TearDown()` method is called to clean up resources.
5. **Fixture Destruction**: The object is deleted.

This cycle ensures that tests remain independent and state modifications do not leak.

### Example: Defining and Using a Test Fixture

```cpp
class MyTestFixture : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    resource_ = new Resource();
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    delete resource_;
  }

  Resource* resource_;
};

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test1) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(resource_->IsValid());
}

TEST_F(MyTestFixture, Test2) {
  ASSERT_NE(resource_, nullptr);
  // Additional assertions...
}
```

In this example, `Test1` and `Test2` share the fixture but run independently with fresh `resource_` initialization.

## Test Cases (Test Suites) and Test Grouping

GoogleTest organizes tests into named *test suites* (historically called *test cases*). All tests within a suite share the same fixture type. This aids in logical organization and shared setup:

- The test suite name is the first argument in both `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros.
- GoogleTest enforces that all tests in the same suite use the same fixture type.
- Suites can contain any number of tests.

### Important Rules

- Avoid mixing `TEST()` and `TEST_F()` macros in the same suite to prevent fixture clashes.
- Suite names should be globally unique within the test program.

## Defining Tests with GoogleTest Macros

### Simple Tests with `TEST`

Defines an independent test that does not use a fixture:

```cpp
TEST(TestSuiteName, TestName) {
  EXPECT_EQ(42, foo.Bar());
}
```

- Both `TestSuiteName` and `TestName` must be valid C++ identifiers without underscores.
- Tests are automatically registered and executed by GoogleTest.

### Fixture Tests with `TEST_F`

Defines a test using a fixture class:

```cpp
TEST_F(FixtureName, TestName) {
  // Access fixture members
  EXPECT_TRUE(resource_->IsAvailable());
}
```

- `FixtureName` must be a fixture class derived from `testing::Test`.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest extends the xUnit model with *parameterized*, *typed*, and *type-parameterized* tests, allowing repetitive testing patterns with varying inputs or types.

These advanced forms defer instantiation of actual test cases to runtime or compile-time mechanisms, enhancing test coverage efficiently.

For detailed concepts, see:
- [Parameterized & Typed Tests](../advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests)
- [Parameterized & Typed Tests API Reference](/api-reference/core-testing-apis/parameterized-testing)

## Automatic Test Discovery

One of GoogleTest’s strengths is letting users define tests anywhere in the codebase without manual registration. On running a test binary:

- GoogleTest automatically discovers tests defined via `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and advanced macros.
- Tests are stored in internal registries indexed by suite and test names.
- The test runner executes all discovered tests in a deterministic order.

### Listing Tests Without Executing

Using the flag `--gtest_list_tests`, users can print all available tests, organized by suite:

```none
MyTestSuite.
  TestA
  TestB
AnotherSuite.
  TestX
```

Helpful when filtering or creating targeted test runs.

### Filtering Tests

Via the `--gtest_filter` flag, users can select specific subsets of tests to run. The filter supports positive and negative patterns with wildcards.

For example:
- `--gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*` runs all tests in `MyTestSuite`.
- `--gtest_filter=*TestA` runs all tests ending with `TestA`.
- `--gtest_filter=*:*Fatal*` runs all tests containing “Fatal”.
- `--gtest_filter=*:-MyTestSuite.TestA` runs all tests except `MyTestSuite.TestA`.

## Test Execution Flow

When you invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest runs through all selected suites and tests as follows:

1. **Setup Test Suites**: Calls `SetUpTestSuite()` static method in the fixture if defined.
2. **Run Individual Tests**: For each test:
    - Constructs the fixture object.
    - Calls `SetUp()`.
    - Runs the test body.
    - Calls `TearDown()`.
    - Destroys the fixture object.
3. **Tear Down Test Suites**: Calls `TearDownTestSuite()` static method if defined.

Failures and skips are tracked and reported.

### Test Ordering and Shuffling

Tests usually run in lexicographic order by file and line number, but can be shuffled randomly with the `--gtest_shuffle` flag. Shuffling helps reveal inter-test dependencies.

### Repeat and Fail-Fast

- Use `--gtest_repeat=N` to run tests N times, helpful for catching flaky tests.
- Use `--gtest_fail_fast` to abort execution on the first failed test.

## Naming Conventions and Restrictions

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names: GoogleTest generates internal classes that use underscores, and underscores can cause naming conflicts or ambiguity.
- Test suites and test names must be valid C++ identifiers and should not begin or end with an underscore.
- To temporarily disable a test, prefix its name with `DISABLED_`.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Test suite mixing fixtures**: GoogleTest requires all tests in the same suite to use the same fixture type. Mixing `TEST_F` and `TEST` in the same suite triggers an error.
- **Ignoring RUN_ALL_TESTS() return value**: Always return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from `main()` to ensure the test runner knows test success or failure.
- **Uninstantiated parameterized tests**: Missing instantiations for `TEST_P` cause errors. Use `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` and `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` to suppress warnings.

## Best Practices

- Use fixtures for shared setup and teardown across tests.
- Name test suites and tests clearly and without underscores.
- Prefer parameterized tests when verifying behavior over multiple inputs.
- Use the filtering and listing flags to run subsets of tests efficiently.
- Avoid side effects in tests to keep them independent and reproducible.
