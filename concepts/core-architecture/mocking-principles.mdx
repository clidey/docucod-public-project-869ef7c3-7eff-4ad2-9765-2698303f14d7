# Mocking in C++: Principles and Practices

GoogleMock (gMock) is a powerful C++ framework that enables you to create mock classes and specify their expected behaviors for unit and integration testing. This document explains the core concepts and philosophy behind gMockâ€™s design, illustrating how interfaces are mocked, how expectations and behaviors are defined, and how C++ metaprogramming underpins flexible, type-safe mocking.

---

## 1. Understanding Mock Objects

A *mock object* is a test double that implements the same interface as a real class but allows precise control and verification of interactions at runtime. It acts as a stand-in during testing, helping you observe how your code under test communicates with its dependencies.

### Why Use Mocks?
- **Isolate Components:** Mocks replace complex or slow dependencies, reducing test flakiness and runtime.
- **Validate Interactions:** Ensure methods are called with expected arguments, number of times, and order.
- **Simulate Behaviors:** Easily simulate errors or special cases in dependencies hard to replicate with real objects.

### Key Mocking Principles
- **Code to Interfaces:** Always mock against virtual interfaces, not concrete classes.
- **Virtual Destructors:** Ensure destructors are virtual to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Expectations Set *Before* Use:** Define expectations (using `EXPECT_CALL`) prior to exercising the code under test.
- **Default Actions vs. Expectations:** `ON_CALL` defines default behavior without requiring the call. `EXPECT_CALL` sets both expectation and behavior.

<Tip>
Mock objects are Naggy by default, meaning uninteresting calls generate warnings. To suppress these, use `NiceMock`; to make uninteresting calls errors, use `StrictMock`.
</Tip>

## 2. Defining Mock Classes with gMock

The primary way to define mocks in GoogleMock is by subclassing the interface and using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro to generate mock method implementations.

### The `MOCK_METHOD` Macro

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(ReturnType, MethodName, (Args...), (Qualifiers));
```

- **ReturnType:** The return type of the mocked method.
- **MethodName:** The method's name.
- **Args:** Argument list enclosed in parentheses.
- **Qualifiers:** Optional method specifiers like `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, or calling conventions.

Example:

```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo() {}  // Must be virtual
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual std::string Describe(const char* name) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Describe, (const char* name), (override));
};
```

**Note:** Mock methods must be declared in the `public:` section regardless of the base class method visibility to allow `EXPECT_CALL` and `ON_CALL` access.

### Mocking Overloaded Methods

Mock all overloaded variants explicitly with correct signatures. Use `using BaseClass::MethodName;` to avoid hiding versions you don't mock.

### Mocking Templates

Templates are mocked like any other class. Each template specialization gets a mock:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class StackInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~StackInterface() {}
  virtual void Push(const T& x) = 0;
};

template <typename T>
class MockStack : public StackInterface<T> {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Push, (const T& x), (override));
};
```

### Handling Unusual Method Qualifiers

The macro supports declaring methods with calling conventions (e.g., `Calltype(STDMETHODCALLTYPE)`), ref-qualified methods (`ref(&)`), and noexcept.

---

## 3. Specifying Mock Behavior

### Expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`

Set expectations on mock method invocations specifying:
- Which methods are expected to be called.
- Argument constraints using *matchers*.
- Expected call counts via *cardinalities*.
- Ordering constraints.
- Actions to perform when called.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(arg_matchers...))
    .Times(cardinality)
    .WillOnce(action)
    .WillRepeatedly(action)
    .InSequence(sequence)...;
```

**Example:**

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;

EXPECT_CALL(turtle, GetX())
    .Times(3)
    .WillOnce(Return(100))
    .WillOnce(Return(150))
    .WillRepeatedly(Return(200));
```

This expectation says:
- Expected 3 calls.
- First returns 100, second 150, and subsequent calls return 200.

### Argument Matchers

Use built-in or custom matchers to check argument values precisely or loosely:
- `_` matches any value.
- `Eq(val)` matches exact value `val`.
- Comparisons like `Ge(10)`, `Lt(20)` for relational matchers.

### Default Actions with `ON_CALL`

Define default behavior without expecting calls:

```cpp
ON_CALL(mock_object, Method(_))
    .WillByDefault(Return(default_value));
```

This lets a method respond with a default action even if no explicit expectation is set.

### Cardinalities

Specify how many times a method is expected to be invoked.
- `Times(n)` for exact n times.
- `AtLeast(n)`, `AtMost(n)` for flexible ranges.
- `AnyNumber()` allows any calls.

If omitted, gMock infers cardinality:
- No action clauses: `Times(1)`.
- `n` `WillOnce` clauses: `Times(n)`.
- `n` `WillOnce` + one `WillRepeatedly`: `Times(AtLeast(n))`.

### Ordering Calls

By default, calls matching expectations can occur in any order.
Use `InSequence` or `After` clauses to require strict or partial ordering.

```cpp
{
  InSequence seq;
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, A());
  EXPECT_CALL(foo, B());
}
```

Enforces that `A()` is called before `B()`.

## 4. Strictness Levels: Nice, Naggy, and Strict Mocks

gMock categorizes the handling of *uninteresting calls* (calls to mock methods without expectations) into three modes:

| Mock Kind    | Behavior on Uninteresting Calls         |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **NiceMock** | Silently ignores and suppresses warnings |
| **NaggyMock** | Issues warnings (default for raw mocks) |
| **StrictMock** | Treats uninteresting calls as test failures |

### Usage

Wrap your mock class with one of these templates to control strictness:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;      // No warnings
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_foo;    // Warnings (default)
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;  // Errors for unexpected calls
```

### Tips

- Prefer `NiceMock` in stable tests for cleaner outputs.
- Use `NaggyMock` during development to be alerted of unexpected calls.
- Reserve `StrictMock` for tests where strict call control is required.

<Tip>
`NiceMock`, `NaggyMock`, and `StrictMock` inherit constructors of the base mock, so you can construct them with the same parameters.
</Tip>

## 5. Leveraging C++ Metaprogramming for Type Safety and Flexibility

GoogleMock uses advanced C++ metaprogramming techniques to:

- Generate mock methods automatically from declarations using macros.
- Ensure type safety by matching method signatures strictly.
- Support overloaded methods, const and noexcept qualifiers, and template methods.
- Provide flexible syntax for matching arguments and chaining actions.

This metaprogramming foundation allows gMock to adapt seamlessly to complex interfaces, enabling developers to write mocks efficiently without sacrificing correctness.

---

## 6. Typical Mocking Workflow

1. **Define Mock Classes**
   - Subclass the interface.
   - Use `MOCK_METHOD` to mock all virtual methods you want to observe/control.

2. **Create Mock Objects**
   - Instantiate mock objects.
   - Consider wrapping them with `NiceMock` or `StrictMock` if needed.

3. **Set Default Actions**
   - Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behaviors (optional).

4. **Set Expectations**
   - Define precise expectations with `EXPECT_CALL`, including argument matchers, call counts, and ordering.

5. **Exercise Code Under Test**
   - Call the code that interacts with mocks.

6. **Automatic Verification**
   - Verification is done automatically when mocks are destructed, ensuring all expectations were met.

<Tip>
Always set expectations before exercising the mock. Otherwise, behavior is undefined and verification may fail unpredictably.
</Tip>

---

## 7. Best Practices and Tips

- **Virtual Destructors:** Interfaces to be mocked must have virtual destructors.
- **Order of Expectations:** Use `InSequence` or `Sequence` objects for ordered calls.
- **Be Judicious with Strictness:** Too strict mocks cause brittle tests; prefer `NiceMock` unless strictness is crucial.
- **Use Wildcard `_` to Avoid Over-Specification:** Only constrain arguments critical to the test.
- **Combine `ON_CALL` and `EXPECT_CALL`:** Use `ON_CALL` for common default behaviors and `EXPECT_CALL` to specify what must be verified.
- **Avoid Mocking Non-Virtual Methods Unless Using High-Perf Techniques:** Prefer interface-based design.
- **Delegate to Fakes or Real Objects:** For complex behavior reuse, delegate to a fake or the real implementation.
- **Check for Uninteresting Calls:** Warnings guide you to potentially missing expectations.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Unexpected Calls to Real Methods
- Ensure methods are virtual to be mockable.

### Overloaded Method Ambiguities
- Use explicit overload selection helpers or specify argument types clearly.

### Uninteresting Call Warnings
- Add appropriate `EXPECT_CALL` or switch to `NiceMock`.

### Memory Leaks and Missing Destructor Calls
- Confirm virtual destructors.

### Slow Mock Compilation
- Define constructors and destructors of mocks out-of-line.

### Exceptions in `NiceMock` with Unknown Return Types
- Some return types require custom actions or default value settings.

## Appendix: Example Usage

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

class Turtle {
 public:
  virtual ~Turtle() {}
  virtual void PenUp() = 0;
  virtual void PenDown() = 0;
  virtual void Forward(int distance) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};

class MockTurtle : public Turtle {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenUp, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, PenDown, (), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Forward, (int distance), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetX, (), (const, override));
};

using ::testing::AtLeast;
using ::testing::Return;

TEST(PaintTest, DrawsLine) {
  MockTurtle turtle;

  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, PenDown()).Times(AtLeast(1));
  EXPECT_CALL(turtle, Forward(100)).Times(1);
  ON_CALL(turtle, GetX()).WillByDefault(Return(42));

  // Code under test uses mock turtle
  turtle.PenDown();
  turtle.Forward(100);
  int x = turtle.GetX();
  EXPECT_EQ(x, 42);
}
```

In this example, `MockTurtle` mocks the `Turtle` interface with `MOCK_METHOD`. Expectations and default actions are set, and the code exercise triggers mock responses, verified automatically.
