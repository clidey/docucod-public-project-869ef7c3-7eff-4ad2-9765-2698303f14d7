# System Overview

GoogleTest and GoogleMock are the foundation of a powerful C++ testing framework that helps developers write unit tests with confidence. This page presents the principal components of both GoogleTest and GoogleMock, illustrating how test cases are structured, how mocks are constructed, and how the overall test execution flow is orchestrated. Understanding these core abstractions and their interactions provides the big picture necessary for writing effective and maintainable tests.

---

## Test Cases and Test Suites

At the heart of GoogleTest lies the concept of a **Test Case**, which groups together related test functions called **Tests**. Each test is a function that verifies a particular aspect of your code.

- **Test Suites** (previously called Test Cases in older versions) are collections of related tests, allowing logical grouping.
- Tests are defined using macros like `TEST` and `TEST_F`, enabling structured organization and reuse of setup code.

A typical flow when writing and running tests is:

1. Define a test suite and one or more test cases.
2. Write assertions within tests to verify expected behaviors.
3. Compile and run all or selected tests.

Example:

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

Here, `MathTest` is the test suite, and `Addition` is the test case verifying addition.

<Check>
Using `TEST_F` allows leveraging fixtures — shared setup and teardown code — across multiple tests in a suite.
</Check>

## Test Fixtures

**Test Fixtures** are classes that provide setup and teardown hooks around tests to eliminate redundant code.

- Use `TEST_F` macro to write tests that leverage fixtures.
- Fixtures define `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` methods called before and after each test.

Example:

```cpp
class DatabaseTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override {
    // Initialize test database
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup test database
  }
};

TEST_F(DatabaseTest, Insert) {
  // Test the insert function with the prepared database
}
```

This pattern promotes reusable setup and keeps tests clean and focused.

## Mock Objects and Mock Classes

GoogleMock extends GoogleTest by allowing dependency mocking to isolate and verify interactions with dependencies in your tests.

### Defining a Mock Class

To mock an interface or abstract class, derive a mock class and declare mock methods using the `MOCK_METHOD` macro.

A mock method has the signature:

```cpp
MOCK_METHOD(return_type, MethodName, (Args...), (qualifiers));
```

where `qualifiers` may include `const`, `override`, `noexcept`, and calling conventions.

Example:

```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo();
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual std::string Describe(const char* name) = 0;
};

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(std::string, Describe, (const char* name), (override));
};
```

### Handling Overloaded and Template Methods

- Overloaded methods can all be mocked with corresponding `MOCK_METHOD` declarations.
- Class templates require mocking each template specialization.

### Special Wrappers: NiceMock, NaggyMock, StrictMock

To control how uninteresting calls (calls with no expectations) are treated, GoogleMock provides wrappers:

- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings for uninteresting calls.
- **NaggyMock**: The default behavior that warns on uninteresting calls.
- **StrictMock**: Treats uninteresting calls as errors.

Example of usage:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;
EXPECT_CALL(nice_foo, GetSize());
```

<Note>
Use these wrappers to tune test strictness and maintainability.
</Note>

### Setting Expectations and Behaviors

The core mechanism in GoogleMock is setting expectations on mock methods.

- Use `EXPECT_CALL(mock_object, Method(matchers))` to specify how the mock should be called.
- Apply modifiers to control call count (`Times`), call order (`InSequence`), and call behavior (`WillOnce`, `WillRepeatedly`).

Example:

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock_foo, Describe(::testing::Eq("test")))
    .Times(2)
    .WillOnce(::testing::Return("first result"))
    .WillRepeatedly(::testing::Return("subsequent result"));
```

### Default Actions

- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior without necessarily expecting the call.
- If no actions or expectations are specified, GoogleMock uses default actions appropriate for the return type.

## Test Execution Flow

Understanding how tests run clarifies how expectations are enacted.

1. **Test runner** discovers and filters tests.
2. Each test is run from `SetUp()` through the test body to `TearDown()`.
3. During execution, mock methods are invoked according to the expectations.
4. On destruction of mocks, GoogleMock verifies that all expectations were satisfied and reports failures otherwise.

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize Test Environment">
The test runner processes command-line args and initializes GoogleTest and GoogleMock.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Each Test Suite">
For each test suite, each test executes setup, test code, and teardown in sequence.
</Step>
<Step title="Mock Interaction">
Mocks accept calls; GoogleMock matches calls against expectations or default actions.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Expectations">
Upon mock destruction, GoogleMock verifies all expectations were met, failing the test if not.
</Step>
</Steps>

## User Workflow Example

Imagine you want to test a component that depends on a `Database` interface:

1. Define a mock of the `Database` interface:

```cpp
class MockDatabase : public Database {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Connect, (const std::string& url), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Query, (const std::string& query_str), (override));
};
```

2. Create a test fixture using the mock:

```cpp
class MyComponentTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  MockDatabase mock_db;
  MyComponent component{&mock_db};
};
```

3. Write a test case with expectations:

```cpp
TEST_F(MyComponentTest, ConnectsAndQueries) {
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Connect("mydb://url")).WillOnce(::testing::Return(true));
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_db, Query("SELECT * FROM users")).WillOnce(::testing::Return(42));

  bool connected = component.Initialize();
  EXPECT_TRUE(connected);
  int result = component.GetUserCount();
  EXPECT_EQ(result, 42);
}
```

This user journey demonstrates effective use of GoogleTest and GoogleMock components to precisely specify behavior and verify interactions.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Always mock interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete classes.
- Prefer `NiceMock` for less brittle tests unless strict behavior verification is required.
- Use sequences and ordering rules when call order matters.
- Use `ON_CALL` to specify default behavior to avoid unexpected failures.
- When mocking overloads or template methods, ensure all variants are covered or `using` declarations are included.
- Carefully choose cardinalities with `Times` to avoid flaky tests.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to mark bases' destructors as `virtual` can cause resource leaks.
- Setting expectations after exercising the mock leads to undefined behavior.
- Over-specifying matchers and expectations makes tests brittle.
- Not using `RetiresOnSaturation` when multiple expectations cover similar calls can cause expectation stickiness issues.
