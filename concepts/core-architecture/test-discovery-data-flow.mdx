# Test Discovery & Data Flow

GoogleTest is designed to provide seamless and automated discovery, registration, execution, and reporting of tests, ensuring that users focus on writing effective tests rather than managing their lifecycles. This page demystifies how GoogleTest discovers tests, orchestrates their execution, and manages the data flow of test results and assertion outcomes, enabling insightful and reliable feedback.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery

GoogleTest eliminates the need to manually register tests. Instead, it automatically discovers all tests defined via its macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, typed and type-parameterized test macros) during program initialization.

### How Test Registration Works

When you write a test using GoogleTest macros, such as:

```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

GoogleTest internally registers this test through static initialization, before `main()` runs. Each test is represented by a `TestInfo` object, which stores metadata like the test suite name, test name, source location, and fixture type.

This registration includes storing a factory callable that creates the test instance on-demand, which decouples test declaration from execution.

### Test Suites and Test Cases

Tests are grouped into *test suites* (previously called test cases), identified by the first macro argument (e.g., `FactorialTest`). Each suite manages shared setup and teardown via fixture classes.

- Tests without fixtures use `TEST`.
- Tests with shared data use fixtures and `TEST_F`.
- Parameterized tests use `TEST_P` and must be instantiated explicitly.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest supports sophisticated discovery for parameterized and typed tests:

- **Value-parameterized tests** (`TEST_P`) are declared once and instantiated with different parameter sets using `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`. Internally, these create multiple generated tests with distinct parameter names.

- **Typed tests** and **type-parameterized tests** declare tests templated on types and register them for each type in a type list.

This registration mechanism ensures that all test instances are accounted for before execution.

## Test Runner and Execution Flow

The test runner responsible for executing tests is activated via the `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` function.

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization:** `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` invokes the test program's initialization, preparing test environments, global fixtures, and parsing test filters.

2. **Filtering:** Tests are filtered based on user-provided criteria (`--gtest_filter`) or disabled status.

3. **Iterative Running:** Tests and suites run in sequence or shuffled order. For each test:
   - The test fixture instance is created.
   - `SetUpTestSuite()` is called once per suite before the first test.
   - The test's `SetUp()` method is run.
   - The test body executes.
   - The test's `TearDown()` method is run.
   - `TearDownTestSuite()` is called after the last test of the suite.

4. **Test Result Collection:** Results and assertion outcomes (success, failure, skips) are captured in `TestResult` and `TestPartResult` objects.

5. **Reporting:** Results are passed on to listeners, including the default console printer and optional XML/JSON reporters.

### Test Ordering and Sharding

- Tests are run in the order they are registered unless overridden by shuffle flags.
- Sharding support enables distributing test execution across multiple machines or processes, controlled via environment variables (`GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS`, `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`).

## Data Flow of Test Results and Assertions

GoogleTest maintains detailed records of test outcomes to facilitate precise, insightful reporting.

### TestPartResult

Each assertion within a test produces a `TestPartResult` capturing:

- Outcome type (`kSuccess`, `kNonFatalFailure`, `kFatalFailure`, `kSkip`).
- Source file and line number.
- Summary and detailed failure message.

This granular data enables GoogleTest to report multiple failures in a single test without halting execution.

### TestResult

Each single test run stores:

- Collection of `TestPartResult` objects.
- Timestamp and elapsed time.
- User-defined properties (key-value pairs) logged via `RecordProperty` during test execution.

### TestInfo and TestSuite

- `TestInfo` aggregates data per individual test, exposing metadata and results.
- `TestSuite` groups related tests (`TestInfo`s), maintaining aggregate statistics, shared setup/teardown results, and suite-level properties.

### UnitTest Singleton

The singleton `UnitTest` aggregates all suites and manages overall test program state, including:

- The active test and suite during execution.
- Random seed and test repetition management.
- Registered event listeners.

This centralized management enables consistent filtering, sharding, and reporting.

---

## Event Listener API

GoogleTest's event listener API allows users and tools to hook into the test lifecycle to: 

- Customize console or XML/JSON output.
- Track failure events.
- Implement resource leak detection or custom reporting.

Relevant events include: test program start/end, iteration start/end, environment setup/teardown, suite start/end, test start/end, and assertion results.

Users can add listeners in `main()` after `InitGoogleTest()`, replacing or supplementing default printers.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Avoid defining tests with underscores in names,** as GoogleTest recommends alphanumeric test and suite names for better filtering and reporting.
- **Use parameterized and typed tests** to scale coverage without verbose repetition.
- **Leverage test filtering** (`--gtest_filter`) and sharding for faster execution in large projects.
- **Monitor test properties** by recording key-value pairs during test runs for richer diagnostics.
- **Prefer ASSERT over EXPECT** if continuation after failure is illogical or unsafe.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests not discovered:** Ensure test macros are used correctly; confirm that test files are compiled and linked.
- **Tests not running due to filters:** Validate `--gtest_filter` values and disabled test prefixes.
- **Flaky tests with sharding:** Confirm unique shard indices and total shard counts; understand that teardown happens after all tests in a shard.
