# Test Discovery and Execution Flow

Understanding how GoogleTest and GoogleMock automatically discover, organize, and execute tests is pivotal to harnessing the full power of the framework. This guide walks you through the mechanisms that underlie test discovery, lifecycle management, execution ordering, filtering, and parallel execution control, enabling you to write reliable and maintainable C++ tests with confidence.

---

## 1. Automated Test Discovery

GoogleTest liberates test writers from enumerating tests manually. Instead, it automatically discovers all declared tests across your linked binaries.

### How It Works

- When you define a test using macros like `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()`, GoogleTest registers each test with a global test registry.
- This registry collects information for every test, including the test suite name, test name, fixture type, source location, and parameterization details.
- GoogleTest uses this metadata to orchestrate execution without the user needing to list or invoke tests explicitly.

> **Example:**
> 
> ```cpp
> TEST(MathTest, FactorialZero) {
>   EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
> }
>
> TEST_F(MyFixture, TestBehavior) {
>   ...
> }
> ```
>
> Each test above is automatically registered.

### Advantages

- Workflows become straightforward, focusing on test logic rather than test management.
- Adding or removing tests requires no extra changes to test runners.
- Simplifies integration with CI and other tools.


## 2. Test Organization: Suites and Fixtures

Tests are organized into logical groups called **test suites** (formerly “test cases”). These suites help maintain clarity by grouping related tests, especially when they share reusable components.

- **Test Suites** group tests by logical area or feature.
- **Fixtures** (`TEST_F`) enable tests to share common setup and teardown code.

### Lifecycle of Fixtures

For each test:

1. A fresh test fixture instance is created.
2. `SetUp()` method runs to prepare test state.
3. The test body executes.
4. `TearDown()` cleans up.
5. The fixture instance is destroyed.

This isolation ensures no tests influence each other, promoting repeatability.


## 3. Execution Flow

GoogleTest executes tests following a consistent and reliable process ensuring isolation, predictable outcomes, and comprehensive failure reporting.

### Test Program Initialization

- Test execution begins in the `main()` function, typically by calling `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` followed by `RUN_ALL_TESTS();`.
- `InitGoogleTest()` parses command-line flags relating to test execution, including filtering, ordering, and output settings.

### Iterating Through Tests

- Tests are run in suites; each suite’s tests execute in a sequence determined by default or by flags.

### Step-by-Step Test Execution

For each test:

1. Create the test fixture object.
2. Call `SetUpTestSuite()` statically before the first test in a suite.
3. Initialize the fixture (`SetUp()`).
4. Run the test code.
5. Run cleanup (`TearDown()`).
6. Destroy fixture.
7. After all tests in the suite, call `TearDownTestSuite()`.

If a fatal failure happens, test execution skips remaining steps for that test and continues with the next one.

### Global Environment Setup and Teardown

- Global setup and teardown are controlled by user-registered instances of `testing::Environment`.
- They run once before and after all tests, respectively.


## 4. Test Filtering and Selection

GoogleTest allows fine-grained control over which tests to run, enabling faster iteration and targeted testing.

### Filtering Syntax

- Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to specify glob-style patterns matching test full names (`TestSuiteName.TestName`).
- Supports positive and negative patterns separated by `-` to exclude tests.

**Example:**

```
--gtest_filter=MySuite.*-MySuite.FlakyTest
```

Runs all tests in `MySuite` except `FlakyTest`.

### Disabled Tests

- Tests with names prefixed by `DISABLED_` are excluded by default.
- Run them explicitly with `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.

### Sharding and Parallelism

- GoogleTest supports running tests in shards to parallelize testing. Tests are distributed over multiple shards by environment.
- Tests that are in another shard are skipped during a run.


## 5. Controlling Test Execution Order

By default, tests run in the order they are registered, but GoogleTest offers control for ordering.

### Shuffling Tests

- Use `--gtest_shuffle` to randomize the order of tests.
- `--gtest_random_seed` sets the seed for deterministic shuffling.

### Explicit Ordering with Sequences and Dependencies

- For mocks and more advanced scenarios ([via GoogleMock](https://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_for_dummies.html)), you can enforce call sequences and ordered execution within a test.
- Test suites themselves run sequentially but do not inherently guarantee cross-suite ordering.


## 6. Parallel Test Runs

While GoogleTest itself executes tests sequentially, you can achieve parallelism by running multiple test binaries or shard executions in parallel using external build or CI systems.

### Streaming Results

- Optionally stream test results in XML or JSON via flags like `--gtest_output=xml:report.xml` for integration with CI dashboards.


## 7. Summary of User Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Write and Register Tests">
Define tests using `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`. GoogleTest automatically registers them.
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Framework">
Call `InitGoogleTest()` in your program's `main()`, which parses flags.
</Step>
<Step title="Run Tests">
Invoke `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, which triggers discovery and execution of all tests matching filters.
</Step>
<Step title="Interpret Results">
GoogleTest reports successes and failures, continues on non-fatal failures.
</Step>
</Steps>


## 8. Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues in Test Discovery and Execution">
<Accordion title="No Tests Run Despite Defining Them">
Make sure tests are linked into your binary. Verify that `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is invoked. Check filters with `--gtest_list_tests`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Running Out Of Order">
Use `--gtest_shuffle` for randomness; otherwise, order is registration order. For sequence control, use GoogleMock sequences.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Tests Not Matching Filters">
Check the exact full test names and the filter syntax, including escaping shell wildcards.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Global Setup or TearDown Failures Prevent Tests">
Review if Environment `SetUp()` or `TearDown()` is generating failures.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Always call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` in your `main()`.
- Use filters extensively to isolate and speed up test runs.
- Group related tests logically in suites and leverage fixtures for shared state.
- For flaky or temporarily disabled tests, prefix their names with `DISABLED_`.
- Utilize GoogleMock's features for precise control when mocking dependencies.
- Use `--gtest_list_tests` to verify test discovery without running them.
