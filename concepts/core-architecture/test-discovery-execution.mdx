# Test Discovery and Execution

Understanding how GoogleTest discovers, organizes, and executes tests is fundamental to mastering test development and integration workflows. This guide unpacks the flow from test definition through registration, test suite formation—including parameterized and typed tests—to the main entry points that launch tests and report outcomes.

## Overview of Test Registration and Discovery

When you write tests with GoogleTest, the framework automatically discovers and registers them during program initialization. This eliminates the need for manual enumeration of tests, enabling instantaneous scalability and ease of maintenance.

### How Tests Are Registered

Each test you define using macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, or `TYPED_TEST()` triggers internal registration. This process links your test functions or methods with their metadata, including **test suite names**, **test names**, **source locations**, and **any parameter or type info**.

For advanced scenarios, `::testing::RegisterTest()` allows runtime dynamic registration of tests. The factory callable passed to it creates a fresh test fixture instance for the test. GoogleTest then tracks these registrations to build the test execution plan.

### Structure Captured at Registration

- **Test Info**: Holds metadata for a single test, including the test suite and test name, location, filtering status, and test result.
- **Test Suite**: Groups multiple tests sharing the same suite name. GoogleTest maintains an internal vector of `TestInfo` pointers.

Once registered, the list of all test suites and their tests are maintained by the singleton `UnitTest` instance.

---

## Organization of Different Test Types

GoogleTest supports various test declaration paradigms, each organized distinctly:

### Simple Tests (`TEST()`)

- Defined as standalone functions grouped under a test suite name.
- Automatically registered during static initialization.
- Independent test fixture per test run.

Example:
```cpp
TEST(FactorialTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Factorial(0), 1);
}
```

### Test Fixtures (`TEST_F()`)

- Group tests sharing a test fixture, which contains common setup/teardown and shared state.
- Each test creates a fresh fixture instance; no cross-test state contamination.

Example:
```cpp
class QueueTest : public testing::Test {
 protected:
  QueueTest() { q_.Enqueue(5); }
  Queue<int> q_;
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, IsNotEmpty) {
  EXPECT_GT(q_.size(), 0);
}
```

### Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P()`)

- Allow a test template to run multiple times with different input values.
- Test fixture inherits from both `Test` and `WithParamInterface<T>`.
- Test parameter accessed via `GetParam()` inside the test body.

Example:
```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<std::string> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, HandlesValues) {
  std::string param = GetParam();
  EXPECT_TRUE(Process(param));
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
  MyInstantiation, FooTest,
  testing::Values("val1", "val2", "val3")
);
```

### Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST()` and `TYPED_TEST_SUITE()`)

- Facilitate testing the same logic across multiple types, enhancing type coverage.
- Fixture is a class template parameterized by type.
- `TYPED_TEST_SUITE` associates a list of types with the test fixture template.

Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class MyTypedTest : public testing::Test {
 public:
  T value_;
};

using MyTypes = ::testing::Types<int, double, char>;
TYPED_TEST_SUITE(MyTypedTest, MyTypes);

TYPED_TEST(MyTypedTest, WorksForAllTypes) {
  TypeParam v = this->value_;
  EXPECT_TRUE(sizeof(v) > 0);
}
```

### Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_P()` and `TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P()`)

- Similar to typed tests but allow the list of types to be defined and instantiated separately.
- Facilitate reusable type-parameterized test patterns.

## Execution Flow

### Initialization

Your test binary calls `testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);` in `main()`. This function:

- Parses GoogleTest-specific command-line flags (e.g., filtering, output format).
- Initializes internal data structures.

After initialization, you call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` to trigger test execution.

### Running Tests

`RUN_ALL_TESTS()` orchestrates the process:

1. Iterates over all registered `TestSuite`s.
2. For each `TestSuite`, calls its static `SetUpTestSuite()` (if implemented).
3. Iterates tests within the suite:
   - Creates a fresh test fixture instance.
   - Calls `SetUp()`.
   - Runs the test body (`TestBody()` override).
   - Calls `TearDown()`.
   - Deletes the test fixture.
4. Calls `TearDownTestSuite()` for the `TestSuite`.
5. Accumulates and reports results.

Test filtering, disabling, and parameterized instantiation influence which tests actually run.

### Reporting

GoogleTest prints results to the console and (optionally) generates an XML or JSON report, detailing:

- Passed and failed tests
- Failures and error messages
- Execution times
- Skipped tests

You can customize reporting by integrating event listeners.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- Define clear and descriptive test suite and test names; avoid underscores per GoogleTest conventions.
- Use test fixtures (`TEST_F`) for shared setup to avoid duplicated code.
- Employ value-parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) for data-driven scenarios, generating multiple test cases efficiently.
- For type combinatorial testing, use `TYPED_TEST` or `TYPED_TEST_P` to cover multiple type variations without repetition.

<Note>
Registering tests dynamically allows powerful customized test creation but should be used when static macros do not suffice.
</Note>

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Tests not discovered?** Ensure all test macros (`TEST`, `TEST_F`, etc.) are used correctly and compiled into the binary.
- **Test not running despite being defined?** Check for filtering flags (`--gtest_filter`) and disabled prefixes (`DISABLED_`).
- **Fatal failures within constructors?** GoogleTest forbids fatal assertions in constructors; use `SetUp()` instead.
- **Parameterization errors?** Verify use of `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P` to instantiate `TEST_P` tests properly.
- **Unexpected test order or sharding effects?** Leverage `--gtest_shuffle` and environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` correctly.
