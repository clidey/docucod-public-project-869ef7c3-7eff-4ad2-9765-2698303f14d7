# Test Discovery and Execution Lifecycle

GoogleTest and GoogleMock simplify the process of writing and running tests in C++. Behind the familiar `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros lies a robust automation engine that detects, registers, and executes tests systematically. This guide unpacks that lifecycle from the moment a test macro is invoked to the final reporting of results, enabling you to confidently understand and customize the flow of your test execution.

## 1. Test Discovery: How GoogleTest Finds Your Tests

Every test you write using GoogleTest macros—be it `TEST`, `TEST_F`, `TEST_P`, or typed test macros—is automatically discovered through a static registration mechanism.

### How Static Registration Works

- When you use a test macro, it creates a unique `TestInfo` object.
- This object includes metadata: suite name, test name, source location, parameter info (if any), and a factory to create the test fixture.
- During static initialization (before `main()`), each `TestInfo` registers itself with the singleton `UnitTest` instance through the internal `MakeAndRegisterTestInfo()` function.

This automatic registration means all tests are known to GoogleTest _before_ runtime, requiring no user intervention to "list" or "register" tests explicitly.

### Test Suites and TestInfo

- Tests are grouped into `TestSuite` objects, each containing multiple `TestInfo` instances.
- Each `TestSuite` corresponds to the test suite name in your test macros.
- The `TestSuite` maintains fixture-level setup and teardown callbacks invoked once for the entire suite.

<Tip>
Each `TestInfo` embodies a single test. Its registration connects you to GoogleTest's powerful reflection and filtering capabilities.
</Tip>

## 2. Test Registration Internals

Behind the scenes, actual test registration is powered by templated factory patterns and runtime checks ensuring accurate test fixture consistency.

### Registration Process

- The `RegisterTest()` template function accepts the suite and test names, parameter info, source location, and a factory creating the test object.
- It verifies that all tests in the same test suite share the same fixture class, preventing mixing of incompatible tests.
- The `TestInfo` constructor owned by GoogleTest stores the factory.
- `TestSuite` instances are collected and maintained in a vector inside the `UnitTest` singleton.

### Ensuring Fixture Consistency

GoogleTest enforces that all tests within a test suite use the same fixture class. This avoids unexpected behaviors when tests are mixed from different sources but given identical suite names.

<Warning>
Mixing test fixture classes under the same suite name causes runtime errors. Use distinct test suite names or share the exact fixture class to resolve this.
</Warning>

---

## 3. Test Execution Lifecycle

Calling `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` starts a highly orchestrated process that runs all registered tests with lifecycle awareness and user-friendly reporting.

### Step 1: Preparation and Setup

- `UnitTest::Run()` is invoked (usually inside `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`).
- Tests are filtered based on user flags (e.g., `--gtest_filter`) and environment settings (e.g., test sharding).
- Global test environments (`testing::Environment`) are set up in registration order.
- Test suites are randomized if `--gtest_shuffle` is enabled.

### Step 2: Running Test Suites

- Each `TestSuite`'s `SetUpTestSuite()` is called to prepare shared resources.
- Based on filtering and flags, each registered test (`TestInfo`) within the suite is run unless skipped or disabled.
- Within each test:
  - A test fixture object is created dynamically using the registered factory.
  - Fixture-level `SetUp()` is called.
  - Test logic runs inside `TestBody()` provided by the user macro or subclass.
  - Fixture-level `TearDown()` is called.
- The framework catches exceptions if configured to do so, translating them into failures without aborting the program.

### Step 3: TearDown and Cleanup

- After all tests in the suite run, `TearDownTestSuite()` is called.
- Global environments (`Environment`) are torn down in the reverse order of setup.
- Test event listeners are notified throughout this process to support customized logging or output.

<Tip>
Test execution is fully customizable through flags like `--gtest_repeat`, `--gtest_fail_fast`, and `--gtest_shuffle` to repeat, stop on failure, or randomize order.
</Tip>

## 4. Filtering and Sharding

GoogleTest provides powerful mechanisms to control which tests run:

### Name-based Filtering

- The `--gtest_filter` flag supports positive and negative glob patterns to include or exclude tests.
- Test names are matched as `<TestSuiteName>.<TestName>`.
- Disabled tests (names prefixed with `DISABLED_`) are excluded by default unless the `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` flag is set.

### Test Sharding

- Environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` enable dividing tests across multiple machines or processes.
- GoogleTest picks tests deterministically based on their order in the total set to assign them to shards.
- This allows parallel execution and faster test throughput.

## 5. Event Listeners and Reporting

GoogleTest emits detailed events through the `TestEventListener` interface during the test program.

### Event Flow

Listeners receive notifications in this order:

1. Program start
2. Each test iteration begins
3. Environment setup starts and ends
4. For each TestSuite:
   - Suite start
   - Each TestInfo start
   - Test part results (assertions)
   - Test end
   - Suite end
5. Environment teardown starts and ends
6. Test iteration end
7. Program end

### Default Listeners

- The default console printer displays colored logs of test starts, assertions, and results.
- XML and JSON listeners output machine-readable reports based on flags.

### Custom Listeners

Users can append custom listeners to hook into or replace output for integration with CI pipelines or IDEs.

## 6. Behind the Macros: Flow of Control

When you invoke `TEST(FooTest, Bar)`, here is the flow behind it:

1. The macro expands to create a subclass of `testing::Test` named `FooTest_Bar_Test`.
2. A static registration object is created that calls `RegisterTest("FooTest", "Bar", ...)`.
3. The factory stored can produce instances of `FooTest_Bar_Test`.
4. `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` calls `UnitTest::Run()` which gathers all tests.
5. For each test:
   - The test fixture object is created.
   - GoogleTest calls `SetUp()`.
   - Runs the test body in `TestBody()`.
   - Then `TearDown()` is invoked.
6. The result is recorded and notifications sent to listeners.

This automation means you focus on your test logic and GoogleTest handles organization and reporting.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Ensure Fixture Consistency:** Use the same fixture type within a suite to avoid runtime failures.
- **Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` Return Value:** Always use the return value to detect test failures in your `main()`.
- **Use Filters Wisely:** Combine filters with disabled tests and sharding cautiously to avoid unintentionally skipping tests.
- **Handle Skips:** Use `GTEST_SKIP()` inside `SetUp()` or test bodies to conditionally skip tests.
- **Leverage Event Listeners:** Customize output through listeners, but avoid generating failures inside listener callbacks.

## Practical Example: Using `TEST` macro and Running Tests

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Here, the macro `TEST` causes automatic static registration. Upon running,
GoogleTest automatically discovers the test, runs it, and reports the result.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Pitfalls">
<Accordion title="Tests Not Discovered or Run">
Check if the `TEST` macros are used at global or namespace scope. Macros inside functions or class methods won't register.

Ensure `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called in `main()` and its result is returned or used.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fixture Misuse">
Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same suite is disallowed. Make sure test fixtures are consistent per test suite.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Filters Not Matching Expected Tests">
Verify your `--gtest_filter` expressions. They are glob patterns applied to `TestSuite.TestName`. Remember that disabled tests are excluded without `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sharding Unexpectedly Skips Tests">
Verify environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX`.

Remember that the shard index must be less than total shards.
