# Test Discovery & Lifecycle

GoogleTest revolutionizes automated testing by eliminating the need for manual test registration. It seamlessly discovers, registers, and executes tests automatically, enabling you to concentrate on crafting high-quality tests rather than managing test execution details.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery and Registration

### How GoogleTest Finds Your Tests

GoogleTest uses its powerful macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, and `TEST_P()` to mark tests. When your test binary is built, these macros register each test with the framework automatically before your `main()` function is executed. This registration includes test suite names, test names, source file locations, and an object factory to create the test fixture or test object.

This dynamic registration means you never have to enumerate your tests explicitly. The framework keeps track of all test suites and tests, including typed and parameterized tests.

### Dynamic Registration Example

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

TEST_F(MyFixture, DoesSomething) {
  EXPECT_TRUE(SomeFunction());
}

void RegisterCustomTests() {
  ::testing::RegisterTest(
      "DynamicSuite", "CustomTest",
      nullptr, nullptr,
      __FILE__, __LINE__,
      []() -> MyFixture* { return new MyFixture(); });
}
```

Here, `RegisterTest` dynamically adds a test called `CustomTest` under the suite `DynamicSuite`. This flexibility supports use cases where tests depend on runtime data.

---

## Test Execution Lifecycle

GoogleTest orchestrates the lifecycle of every test to maintain isolation, reliability, and repeatability. Each test progresses through three essential phases:

### 1. Setup Phase

- For simple tests (`TEST()`), GoogleTest creates a new instance of the default `Test` fixture.
- For fixture-based tests (`TEST_F()`), it creates an instance of your test fixture class.
- Calls `SetUpTestSuite()` once before the first test in each test suite to prepare shared resources.
- Before each individual test:
  - The fixture's constructor runs.
  - The `SetUp()` method is called to prepare test-specific setup.

### 2. Execution Phase

- GoogleTest calls your test function (via `TestBody()`) that contains assertions verifying behavior.
- Assertions report success, non-fatal, or fatal failures, controlling test result.
- If a fatal failure occurs, GoogleTest aborts the current test but continues the test suite.

### 3. Teardown Phase

- After execution, GoogleTest calls the `TearDown()` method to release test-specific resources.
- The fixture object is destroyed (destructor called).
- After the last test in the suite finishes, `TearDownTestSuite()` is called to clean up shared resources.

Each test runs on a fresh fixture object to ensure independence and to avoid side effects affecting other tests.

---

## Iterating Over Tests

When you call `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`, GoogleTest executes every registered test in order:

- Saves GoogleTest flag states to isolate test environments.
- Runs global environments' `SetUp()` methods.
- For each registered test suite and each test within:
  - Runs `SetUpTestSuite()` once at the start.
  - Runs the individual test following the lifecycle above.
  - Runs `TearDownTestSuite()` after all tests in the suite have completed.
- Runs global environments' `TearDown()` methods.
- Collects, reports, and returns the overall success or failure.

You can control the set of tests executed using filters (`--gtest_filter`), enable repeated runs (`--gtest_repeat`), or randomize test order (`--gtest_shuffle`).

---

## Managing Test Suites and Tests

### Grouping Tests into Suites

Tests with common functionality or configuration are grouped into test suites. Suites may share costly resources by using static members and `SetUpTestSuite()` / `TearDownTestSuite()`.

### Naming Conventions

- Test suite and test names must be valid C++ identifiers without underscores to avoid collisions.
- Suites typically describe the module/class under test.
- Tests describe expected behavior or scenarios.

### Parameterized and Typed Tests

GoogleTest handles registration and execution of parameterized (`TEST_P`) and typed tests automatically with additional registration macros and type lists. This extends automated discovery to data-driven testing.

---

## Global Setup and Teardown

GoogleTest supports global environments via the `Environment` class. These are useful for one-time setup or cleanup necessary across all tests, for example, database connections or configuring shared test state.

### Defining and Adding an Environment

```cpp
class MyEnvironment : public ::testing::Environment {
 public:
  void SetUp() override {
    // One-time initialization code
  }

  void TearDown() override {
    // Cleanup code
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  ::testing::AddGlobalTestEnvironment(new MyEnvironment);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

`SetUp()` is called before tests begin, and `TearDown()` after all tests complete, maintaining context integrity around the entire test program.

---

## Event Listener Integration

GoogleTest provides an event listener interface that lets your code hook into the test lifecycle events such as start/end of tests, suites, and the entire program. This enables advanced reporting, custom output formats, or resource leak detection.

### Example: Custom Minimalistic Event Listener

```cpp
class MyListener : public ::testing::EmptyTestEventListener {
 public:
  void OnTestStart(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Starting test: " << test_info.test_suite_name()
              << "." << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
  void OnTestEnd(const ::testing::TestInfo& test_info) override {
    std::cout << "Finished test: " << test_info.test_suite_name()
              << "." << test_info.name() << std::endl;
  }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  testing::UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners().Append(new MyListener);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

Listeners receive events in strict order, corresponding exactly to the lifecycle phases.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Always call `InitGoogleTest()` before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.** This sets up internal state and parses flags.
- **Never ignore the return value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`**; it indicates test success or failure.
- **Keep test suites independent.** Rely on `SetUpTestSuite()` and `TearDownTestSuite()` to share resources safely.
- **Use event listeners for customized reporting or tooling integration.**
- **Leverage test filters, sharding, and repetition flags** to target and speed up testing.
- **Remember each test runs on a fresh fixture instance;** avoid cross-test contamination.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If tests are not discovered:
  - Ensure you use the proper `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, or `TEST_P()` macros.
  - Confirm that `InitGoogleTest()` is called before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`.
- For tests skipped unexpectedly:
  - Check filters with `--gtest_filter`.
  - Verify disabled tests and use `--gtest_also_run_disabled_tests` if necessary.
- When test fixtures fail to set up:
  - Review fixture constructors, `SetUp()`, and suite setup methods.
  - Avoid throwing exceptions; if needed, ensure exception catching is enabled.

GoogleTest automates the testing process end-to-end. Understanding its test discovery and lifecycle empowers you to write maintainable, robust tests that integrate smoothly with your development flow.
